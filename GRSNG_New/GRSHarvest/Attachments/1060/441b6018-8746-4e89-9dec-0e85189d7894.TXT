Of 4903 patients at 128 Veterans Health Administration hospitals who received sorafenib, 232 underwent transarterial chemoembolization within 3 months. After adjustment for covariates associated with selection for combination therapy and outcome (with propensity matching), sorafenib + early transarterial chemoembolization was associated with a significant survival advantage over sorafenib alone with hazard ratio of 0.76 (p = 0.005). This corresponded into an increased median survival from 299 to 412 days. The benefit of adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization was appeared to be mitigated by local invasion and distant metastases [&lt;ulink linkID="1973203" linkType="Reference"&gt;1973203&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2017, data from a multicenter, randomized pilot study (&lt;ulink linkID="70404" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01203787&lt;/ulink&gt;) which evaluated the impact of ramp-up dosing (RD) versus standard dosing (SD) of sorafenib on drug delivery and tolerability, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were presented at the AASLD's Liver Meeting 2017 in Washington DC. With respect to cumulative dose, discontinuation due to AE and overall frequency of AE, no statistically significant benefit to the RD regimen of sorafenib over SD was observed [&lt;ulink linkID="1973077" linkType="Reference"&gt;1973077&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2016, clinical data from a “Real World” Veteran Cohort study which evaluated care delivery patterns and factors associated with improved survival in largest US cohort with hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 6827) receiving sorafenib were presented at the AASLD's Liver Meeting 2016 in Boston, MA. Unadjusted five year survival of the HCC cohort by Barcelona clinical liver cancer stage 0, A, B, C, and D was 3.2, 2.4, 1.2, 0.4 and 0.3 years, respectively. Care by hepatology was found to be not associated with higher odds of HCC therapy, but was associated with improved survival. Moreover, multi-disciplinary tumor board was also associated with improved survival [&lt;ulink linkID="1873019" linkType="Reference"&gt;1873019&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In  October 2016, pooled data from two prospective, observational studies (Italian subgroups of GIDEON [international] and STELLA [Italian]), performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were presented at the 24th UEG Week in Vienna, Austria. A total of 512 patients were enrolled between June 2009 and January 2014 of which 498 and 485 patients were evaluable for efficacy and safety (primary endpoints), respectively. Median OS and time to progression was 10.7 and 6.0 months, respectively. Overall, adverse events of all grades were reported by 82% of patients and the most frequent were fatigue, diarrhea and hand-foot skin reaction reported by 29, 24 and 16% of patients, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1868566" linkType="Reference"&gt;1868566&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2015, information about an observational OPTIMIS study in patients (n = 489) with hepatocellular carcinoma was presented at the 9th ILCA Annual Conference in Paris, France.

In February 2017, clinical data from 1115 patients were presented at the 26th Annual APASL Conference in Shanghai, China. In China versus total population, bilirubin changes were observed in 9 versus 57, 10 versus 42 and 5 verus 38, respectively; albumin changes were observed in 12 versus 74, 14 versus 70 and 15 versus 96, respectively, after first, second and &amp;gt; 2 TACE;  all treatment emergent adverse events with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade &amp;gt;/= 3 related to sorafenib was reported by 12 versus 93 patients, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1903998" linkType="Reference"&gt;1903998&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In October 2018, final analysis data were presented at the 2018 ESMO Congress in Munich, Germany. In global population, median overall survival was longer for patients in cohort 1 (patients received sorafenib early at the time of TACE ineligibility) versus 2 (decision not to start sorafenib early at the time of TACE ineligibility or not at all) (16.2 versus 12.1 months, respectively) after balancing the two cohorts according to patient characteristics. OS was not analyzed in Europe/Canada due to low patient numbers.  The area of first TACE administration was comparable between Europe/Canada and the global population. Complete response and partial response rates to first TACE were similar between Europe/Canada (11 and 28%, respectively) and the global population (14 versus 26%, respectively). Progressive disease rates generally remained consistent in Europe/Canada whereas a trend to increase in rate by number of TACE procedures was observed in the global population.  After first TACE, there was liver function deterioration in both the acute and chronic periods across all assessed liver parameters [&lt;ulink linkID="2084843" linkType="Reference"&gt;2084843&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2015, clinical data were presented from a multi-center, observational, prospective, non-interventional, phase IV study (STELLA), at the 9th ILCA Annual Conference in Paris, France. Patients (n = 224) were administered with sorafenib. Overall survival rate was 54% at 12 months. All grade adverse events (AEs) and drug-related AEs were reported in 176 and 151 patients, respectively. Most frequent drug-related AEs were gastrointestinal (33%), dermatologic (30%), fatigue (27%) and anorexia (13%).

In the overall population, the median time for disease progression and overall survival (OS) was 4.9 and 15.8 months, respectively. According to Barcelona clinic liver cancer stages, the median OS was 29.1, 25.1, 14.4 and 3.1 months for stage A, B, C and D, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1481572" linkType="Reference"&gt;1481572&lt;/ulink&gt;].

The duration of sorafenib treatment was &amp;gt;/= 4 weeks and &amp;gt; 28 weeks  in 13 and 18% of patients with Child-Pugh A liver function, respectively, 23  and 14% of patients with Child-Pugh B liver function, respectively, and 46 and 6% of patients with Child-Pugh C liver function, respectively. The preliminary median time-to-progression was 4.2, 3.6 and 2.1 months among patients with Child-Pugh (CP) A, B and C liver function, respectively   [&lt;ulink linkID="1195614" linkType="Reference"&gt;1195614&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further interim data were presented in November 2011, at the 62nd Annual Meeting of the AASLD in San Francisco, CA. Of the 1571 patients evaluable for safety, 74% (n = 1161) had sorafenib initiated at the recommended 800 mg/day dose, 22% (n = 347) at 400 mg/day, and 4% at other doses. Overall, patient demographics and disease characteristics did not appear to influence initial dose considerations; however, there were regional variations in initial dose selections, with more patients in the US and Japan having sorafenib initiated at lower doses than other regions. Additionally, patients with sorafenib initiated at lower doses tended to stop treatment earlier. Based on the intent-to-treat population (n = 1612), preliminary OS and median time to progression was 9.3 and 4.5 months, and 7.1 and 3.6 months for the 800 mg/day (n = 1192) and 400 mg/day (n = 354) initial dose groups, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1237342" linkType="Reference"&gt;1237342&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a second interim analysis, which evaluated safety and dosing selection in US patients, data showed that the frequency of dose interruptions/modifications were similar across the 800 (n = 177) and 400 mg/day (n = 106) groups; however, more patients in the initial 400 mg/day group (38%) had dose increases compared to 14% for the initial 800 mg/day group. Additionally, patients who received initial 400 mg/day sorafenib tended to discontinue treatment more often than those who started with 800 mg/day. Other data suggested that the 400 mg/day initial dose appeared to be more favored in US patients with ECOG 1, CP-B cirrhosis, higher bilirubin and a higher frequency of ascites [&lt;ulink linkID="1237340" linkType="Reference"&gt;1237340&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A third interim analysis showed that compared with other regions, Japanese patients tended to receive more treatments before sorafenib; more patients in Asia-Pacific (AP) and Japan received prior transarterial chemoembolization (TACE; 64% and 76%) and surgery (24% and 40%) than in other regions (TACE 15 to 37%; surgery 7 to 14%), respectively. Median time from initial diagnosis to sorafenib initiation and  median time from diagnosis to death was longer in Japan (30 and 100 months, respectively) than in other regions (1 to 3 months and 16 to 37 months, respectively), suggesting early detection and curative treatments and/or TACE are performed more frequently in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="1237356" linkType="Reference"&gt;1237356&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a fourth interim analysis which compared the safety of sorafenib in US patients with Child-Pugh (CP) A (n = 119), B (n = 100) and C (n = 19) status, data showed that despite a lower median initial dose in the CP-B patients, the average daily sorafenib dose was similar between CP-A and CP-B groups (580 and 577 mg/day, respectively). However, median treatment duration was shorter for CP-B patients (10.1 weeks), compared with 14.4 weeks for CP-A. Treatment-emergent drug-related adverse events (AEs) were similar in both groups, however in the CP-B group, there were more serious AEs and more patients discontinued sorafenib due to AEs despite lower average sorafenib exposure [&lt;ulink linkID="1237358" linkType="Reference"&gt;1237358&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2012, analysis presented at the 47th EASL Annual Meeting in Barcelona, Spain,  suggested that CP-B scores did not determine sorafenib dose. The lower OS in CP-B9 patients could reflect poorer prognosis in that group [&lt;ulink linkID="1280593" linkType="Reference"&gt;1280593&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2013, further data were presented at The Liver Meeting 2013 in Washington, DC.

In sorafenib-pazopanib and pazopanib-sorafenib groups, the median total progression-free-survival (tPFS) was 8.6 and 12.9 months, respectively (hazard ratio of 1.36). The non-inferiority of tPFS with sorafenib-pazopanib compared with pazopanib-sorafenib (primary endpoint) was not met.

In June 2018, results from the RESORT study were presented at the 54th ASCO Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL. Eligible patients (n = 68) were randomized (1:1) to receive sorafenib for 52 weeks or observation for 52 weeks. An early termination was decided in December 2017, and hence the planned sample size was not attained. During a median follow-up of 21 months, recurrence-free survival (RFS; primary outcome) rate with sorafenib (n = 32) and observation (n = 36) was 44 and 33% in the Recurrence-Yes arm and 56 and 67% in Recurrence-No arm, respectively.

Intrapatient dose escalation of sorafenib to 800 mg bid in the third month was well tolerated by 18 patients. In the intent-to-treat population (n = 67), 18% showed partial response (PR), with the highest response rate observed in the 800-mg bid group. The median progression-free survival (PFS) duration was 7.4 months (3.7, 7.4 and 8.5 months in the 400, 600 and 800 mg bid groups, respectively). In the 18 patients who completed 6 months of treatment with at least 4 months at the highest tolerated dose of sorafenib, the overall response rate (primary endpoint) was 44%, with 8 patients showing PR and 10 patients having stable disease.

Further data from this study were reported in November 2003, at the 15th AACR-NCI-EORTC meeting in Boston, MA. Of the 59 patients with RCC enrolled by this time, 18 RCC patients were evaluable for response. Patients whose target lesion tumor burden showed growth of over 25% (PD) during the induction phase were discontinued from the study. Patients whose tumor demonstrated target lesion shrinkage of over 25% (responders) were not randomized and continued sorafenib in an open-label phase, until disease progression or toxicity. Results showed that three patients discontinued study drug due to PD earlier than the 12-week assessment, eight responders continued on sorafenib, seven patients with SD were randomized to either sorafenib or placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="515700" linkType="Reference"&gt;515700&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="516814" linkType="Reference"&gt;516814&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In October 2004, further results were reported. After 12 weeks of sorafenib treatment, 65 patients were randomized to receive placebo or sorafenib for a further 12 weeks. A higher percentage of those receiving sorafenib compared to placebo had no disease progression. In addition to the 65 randomized patients, a further 79 continued to receive open-label sorafenib. Taken as a whole, 70% of patients had tumor shrinkage of disease stabilization, and time-to-progression was 169 days as assessed by study investigators, and 161 days as assessed by independent review. The most commonly reported side effects were hand-foot syndrome, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, weight-loss and hypertension, all of which were manageable and reversible [&lt;ulink linkID="566379" linkType="Reference"&gt;566379&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented in May 2005 at the 41st ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL.

Patients were enrolled in cohorts of six to determine the MTD and DLT of the combination. The dosing schedule was bevacizumab iv every 14 days and sorafenib daily in two 28-day cycles. Initial doses were bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg and sorafenib at 200 mg bid. At that time, 18 patients had been enrolled. Full doses of both drugs could not be administered due to DLTs at 400 mg bid sorafenib and 5 mg/kg bevacizumab, although the MTD for the combination had not been determined. Responses included almost 50% partial responses and 15% with near PR (20 to 30% regression). Only two patients had disease progression [&lt;ulink linkID="670394" linkType="Reference"&gt;670394&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2007,  data were presented at the 43rd ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL.

In October 2007, final data were presented at the 19th AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference in San Francisco, CA. A total of 48 patients had been enrolled in the trial. Dose-limiting toxicities consisted of grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, grade 3 anorexia, grade 3 decreased performance status and grade 3 hypertension. Additional toxicities included weight loss, stomatitis, gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer, proteinuria, rash and fatigue. Bevacizumab 3 mg/kg plus sorafenib 200 mg QD, and  bevacizumab 5 mg/kg plus sorafenib 200 mg QD were well tolerated by all 12 patients.  The latter combination was well tolerated by all six patients for multiple cycles and was thus recommended as the MTD. 46 patients were evaluable for response; 46% had RECIST-defined partial response, including two patients with sarcomatoid RCC. An additional 23 patients had stable disease, one developed progressive disease and one died from disease progression prior to initial evaluation. 89% of patients experienced some tumor shrinkage ranging from 5 to 80 % from baseline. This combination was to be taken forward into an ECOG-sponsored, multi-arm phase II trial (the BEST trial) [&lt;ulink linkID="840357" linkType="Reference"&gt;840357&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Adjuvant RCC treatment&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2006, a randomized, double-blind phase III study (&lt;ulink linkID="58171" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00326898&lt;/ulink&gt;; ECOG-E2805; ASSURE) was initiated by ECOG in the US, to evaluate sorafenib versus &lt;ulink linkID="12973" linkType="Drug"&gt;sunitinib&lt;/ulink&gt; as adjuvant therapy for patients (estimated n = 1900) with advanced kidney cancer that has been removed by surgery. The primary endpoint was disease free survival. The secondary endpoints included OS and quality of life.

In February 2015, clinical data were presneted at the ASCO Genitourinary Symposium in Orlando, FL. No significant difference in disease free survival  or overall survival between in either arms or placebo was observed (DFS was 5.6 years for both sorafenib and sunitinib, and 5.7 years for placebo).

Patients (n = 954) were randomized (1:1) to receive lenvatinib (8 or 12 mg in patients with body weight &amp;lt; 60 or &amp;gt;/= 60 kg, respectively, qd) or sorafenib (400 mg, bid). The median overall survival (primary endpoint) was 13.6 and 12.3 months in lenvatinib and sorafenib groups, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.92). In lenvatinib and sorafenib groups, secondary endpoints of median progression free survival (PFS) was 7.4 and 3.7 months, respectively, and time to progression was 8.9 and 3.7 months, respectively. Objective response rate, complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease was observed in 115, 6, 109, 246 and 71 patients, respectively, in lenvatinib group and in 44, 2, 42, 244 and 147 patients, respectively, in sorafenib group [&lt;ulink linkID="1931716" linkType="Reference"&gt;1931716&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1933865" linkType="Reference"&gt;1933865&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1934627" linkType="Reference"&gt;1934627&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1928737" linkType="Reference"&gt;1928737&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2018, results from final analysis of serum biomarkers were presented at 2018 ESMO Congress in Munich, Germany. Both lenvatinib and sorafenib treatments increased VEGF levels, while only lenvatinib increased FGF19 and FGF23 levels. Patients with complete response/partial response treated with lenvatinib had a greater increase in FGF19 and FGF23 from baseline versus non-responders. Higher VEGF, ANG2 and FGF21 baseline levels were found to be associated with worse OS in both treatment groups [&lt;ulink linkID="2084813" linkType="Reference"&gt;2084813&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2015, clinical data were presented from pooled analysis of randomized, SHARP and Asia-Pacific (AP) phase III trials at the 9th ILCA Annual Conference in Paris, France.

Longer survival time was observed in patients with HCV in sorafenib group, when compared with placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1725809" linkType="Reference"&gt;1725809&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2016, further clinical data were presented at the 25th annual APASL conference in Tokyo, Japan. There was significantly greater overall survival (OS) benefit of sorafenib versus placebo for patients with versus without HCV (HR 0.47 versus 0.81, resectively).

In September 2009, similar data were presented at the joint 15th European Cancer Organisation and 34th European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin, Germany. Sorafenib plus capecitabine treatment resulted in a 74% improvement in the risk of disease progression compared to capecitabine plus placebo alone. Overall, the combination treatment was well tolerated; common grade III or IV treatment-related adverse events included hand-foot skin reaction, diarrhea, dyspnea, neutropenia and mucositis [&lt;ulink linkID="1044195" linkType="Reference"&gt;1044195&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1056197" linkType="Reference"&gt;1056197&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2009, further data were presented at the 32nd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in San Antonio, TX. Patients receiving capecitabine plus sorafenib had a 74% improvement in PFS compared to those who received  capecitabine alone.

In May 2011, it was reported that the trial had met the primary endpoint; sorafenib plus chemotherapy significantly improved PFS compared with placebo plus chemotherapy. In addition, time-to-progression was significantly improved in the sorafenib arm compared with the placebo arm [&lt;ulink linkID="1192837" linkType="Reference"&gt;1192837&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2011, data were presented at the 47th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL.

The objective was to compare improvements in OS in patients receiving sorafenib (400 mg bid) or placebo, both in combination with &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="3803" linkType="Drug"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/ulink&gt;. The trial was sponsored by the &lt;ulink linkID="20519" linkType="Company"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/ulink&gt; (NCI) and led by the &lt;ulink linkID="24771" linkType="Company"&gt;Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&lt;/ulink&gt; under a Clinical Trials Agreement between NCI and Bayer and Onyx. In April 2009, Bayer and Onyx reported that the trial had been stopped early, following an interim analysis by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), which concluded that the drug would not achieve its primary endpoint. Results from the study were expected to be presented at an upcoming meeting. At that time, the companies were reviewing the DMC's analysis to determine any potential impact on ongoing sorafenib melanoma trials [&lt;ulink linkID="1003344" linkType="Reference"&gt;1003344&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In June 2010, at the 46th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL, results were presented showing that the addition of sorafenib to carboplatin and paclitaxel did not improve OS;  there were no significant differences between the treatment groups for OS, PFS or RR. The median OS for the sorafenib combination group was 11.1 months compared to 11.3 months for the carboplatin plus paclitaxel group. Median PFS was 4.9 months versus 4.1 months. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in  78% of  patients in the sorafenib group versus 84% [&lt;ulink linkID="1104817" linkType="Reference"&gt;1104817&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Second-line&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2005, Bayer and Onyx began a multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase III trial (&lt;ulink linkID="25614" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00111007&lt;/ulink&gt;; EudraCT 2005-000941-12) of sorafenib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in advanced metastatic melanoma. The study, to be carried out under an FDA SPA would enroll over 200 patients in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia who had failed no more than one previous systemic chemotherapeutic treatment with either dacarbazine or &lt;ulink linkID="4529" linkType="Drug"&gt;temozolomide&lt;/ulink&gt;. Patients would receive 400 mg of oral sorafenib bid, or placebo, along with standard dosing  of carboplatin and paclitaxel. The primary endpoint was PFS [&lt;ulink linkID="588659" linkType="Reference"&gt;588659&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="601128" linkType="Reference"&gt;601128&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2005,  data were presented at the Perspectives in Melanoma IX meeting in Tampa, FL. Data from 54 patients showed a 37% objective response rate and 26 patients with stable disease; 63% of patients were progression-free for 6 months. Patients with no prior treatment had a 48% response rate (20% for patients with two or more prior therapies). Patients with a known BRAF mutant status had a 38% response rate compared to 50% for wild-type BRAF patients [&lt;ulink linkID="638426" linkType="Reference"&gt;638426&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were presented at the 43rd ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL, in June 2007 [&lt;ulink linkID="797573" linkType="Reference"&gt;797573&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2006, it was reported that sorafenib  had failed to meet its primary endpoint of PFS, and the trial was halted [&lt;ulink linkID="747970" linkType="Reference"&gt;747970&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="930182" linkType="Reference"&gt;930182&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By January 2009, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1043828" linkType="Reference"&gt;1043828&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2009, development was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="989367" linkType="Reference"&gt;989367&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In  June 2009,   further data were published. A total of 270 patients were treated, with results demonstrating a median PFS of 17.9 weeks for the placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel arm and 17.4 weeks for the sorafenib plus carboplatin and paclitaxel arm.  Sorafenib  did not improve any of the end points over placebo  and could not be recommended as 2nd-line  treatment for patients with advanced melanoma [&lt;ulink linkID="1044011" linkType="Reference"&gt;1044011&lt;/ulink&gt;].   &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2005 at the 41st ASCO meeting,  data were presented from a phase I/II study, whereby metastatic melanoma patients (n = 22) were administered sorafenib (400 mg bid) over a 4-week cycle. The drug was well tolerated with no grade 3/4 toxicities observed. Out of the 21 evaluable patients, there was 1 PR and 12 SD, with a median time-to-progression of 4 months. Pharmacokinetic data were collected and a cocktail of &lt;ulink linkID="44303" linkType="Drug"&gt;midazolam&lt;/ulink&gt; (2 mg), &lt;ulink linkID="44305" linkType="Drug"&gt;omeprazole&lt;/ulink&gt; (20 mg) and dextromethorphan (30 mg) was administered to evaluate the effect of sorafenib on CYP metabolic pathways. Pharmacokinetic parameters included a Cmax, AUC and half-life of 4.9 mg/l, 38.1 mg.h/l and 4 h, respectively. There was no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, omeprazole or dextromethorphan following sorafenib administration [&lt;ulink linkID="603387" linkType="Reference"&gt;603387&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2004, phase II data were presented at the SMi Clinical Trials in Cancer meeting in London, UK. Following administration of sorafenib to 37 patients (400 mg, bid for 3 months), one patient demonstrated a &amp;gt; 25% reduction in tumor size, six patients had SD for &amp;gt; 3 months and 30 had PD at or before 3 months. When sorafenib was administered in combination with &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; and paclitaxel significant hematological toxicity was observed. Of the 35 evaluable patients, 14 (4%) had partial response (PR), 15 (43%) had SD, two (6%) had PD at 8 months or later, and four (11%) discontinued the trial for reasons other than PD. The median time to progression was 10 months [&lt;ulink linkID="545693" linkType="Reference"&gt;545693&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="545741" linkType="Reference"&gt;545741&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2004 similar data were presented at the 40th ASCO meeting in New Orleans, LA [&lt;ulink linkID="545629" linkType="Reference"&gt;545629&lt;/ulink&gt;]. When combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin, improved response rates were observed [&lt;ulink linkID="548774" linkType="Reference"&gt;548774&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By November 2004, phase II trials of sorafenib in combination with &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; plus paclitaxel were ongoing in melanoma [&lt;ulink linkID="572873" linkType="Reference"&gt;572873&lt;/ulink&gt;]; phase III trials were in the planning stages [&lt;ulink linkID="548774" linkType="Reference"&gt;548774&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2002, phase I/II trials in combination with docetaxel were ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="454872" linkType="Reference"&gt;454872&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2004, Bayer reported that sorafenib monotherapy had shown limited activity in phase II trials of patients with metastatic melanoma, but that in combination with docetaxel, sorafenib showed promise for this indication [&lt;ulink linkID="540148" linkType="Reference"&gt;540148&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="539799" linkType="Reference"&gt;539799&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Two phase II trials examining the combination of sorafenib and dacarbazine were no longer recruiting by July 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="930182" linkType="Reference"&gt;930182&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2007, at the 43rd ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL, data were presented on a phase I trial involving the administration of a combination of sorafenib (400 mg bid) and dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 q3w) in 83 advanced melanoma patients. Of 74 evaluable patients, partial responses, stable disease, and progressive disease were seen in 8, 34 and 32 patients, respectively. The median progression-free and  OS were 14 and 41 weeks, respectively, and PFS rates at 3  and 6 months were 56% and 33%. The main grade 3/4 toxicities were unusual levels of neutrophils and platelets [&lt;ulink linkID="796260" linkType="Reference"&gt;796260&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2005,  data were presented at the 41st ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. In an open-label, dose-escalation phase I study, patients with metastatic melanoma were administered sorafenib (200 or 400 mg po bid) in combination with dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2) in a 3-week cycle. One patient on the 400 mg dose experienced a DLT. Of the 11 evaluable patients, two had PR, two had response not reaching PR, one had SD and six had PD. The maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg sorafenib in combination with 1000 mg/m2 dacarbazine [&lt;ulink linkID="601544" linkType="Reference"&gt;601544&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Pharmacokinetic data presented at the 43rd ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL in June 2007 demonstrated that the combination resulted in moderate decreases in dacarbazine exposure, however more pronounced increases in AIC (an inactive metabolite) exposure were observed. The pharmacokinetic profile of sorafenib was not significantly affected by coadministration with dacarbazine [&lt;ulink linkID="797086" linkType="Reference"&gt;797086&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Prostate cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;In October 2007,  data on sorafanib from a phase II investigator-led trial for prostate cancer were presented at the 19th AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference in San Francisco, CA.  Patients with progressive metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer  were enrolled in this study. Sorafenib was given continuously at a dose of 400 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles. 22 patients  were enrolled between September 2004 and April 2005 for the first stage of this trial. No complete or partial response was observed. Sorafenib was generally well tolerated and had manageable side effects, although PK showed high variability [&lt;ulink linkID="845212" linkType="Reference"&gt;845212&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Chronic lymphocytic leukemia&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2011, an open-label, single-group, phase II study (&lt;ulink linkID="84039" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01510756&lt;/ulink&gt;; 110574) began in the US to assess the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL (expected n = 10). The primary endpoint was the overall response rate.

Patients received capecitabine (210 mg/m3/day, po) from day 1 in a 2 weeks on/1 week off schedule. Sorafenib was administered orally from day 8 to day 21. After day 21 it was administered at either 200 mg, 400 mg or 200 mg doses for the first two cycles, followed by 400 mg for the following cycles. The most frequent drug-related toxicities were hand-foot syndrome (HFS), diarrhea, fatigue, mucositis and nausea. DLTs included HFS grade 3 and diarrhea grade 3 (200 mg group), HFS grade 3 and mucositis grade 3 (400 mg group). All four patients in the 400 mg group discontinued the planned regimen after the first or second cycle due to side effects. Treatment was ongoing in all patients in the 200 mg/400 mg group. One heavily pretreated patient from the 200 mg group with breast cancer and skin lymphangitis showed tumor regression.

A total of 24 patients with various solid tumors received continuous sorafenib (200 mg to 400 mg bid) with a fixed dose of oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) every 3 weeks. Single infusions of oxaliplatin did not significantly alter the steady state pharmacokinetic profile of sorafenib and visa-versa.

The most frequent adverse events were related to doxorubicin, while most sorafenib-related adverse events were grade 1 to grade 2. There was no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between the drugs. The recommended phase II dose of sorafenib was 400 mg bid when administered in combination with doxorubicin. A partial response was observed in one patient with mesothelioma who received the higher dose of sorafenib, and stable disease was achieved in 17 patients [&lt;ulink linkID="543742" linkType="Reference"&gt;543742&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2003, phase I data on sorafenib in combination with &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; and paclitaxel were presented at the 39th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL. In a 21-day cycle regimen, 11 patients with melanoma or other tumor types received oral doses of either 100, 200 or 400 mg bid of sorafenib on days 2 and 19 with both carboplatin (AUC = 6) and paclitaxel (225 mg/m2) delivered on day 1. After two cycles of treatment, of the 10 evaluable patients, three had a partial response, one had progressive disease and six out of 10 had stable disease (four of whom showed signs of tumor necrosis), although two of the patients with stable disease showed progressive disease after 3 and 5 months. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities after the first cycle included neutropenia (grade 4: two patients), thrombocytopenia (grade 3: two patients), anemia (grade 3: one patient), rash (grade 3: one patient), hypersensitivity (grade 3: one patient) and fatigue (grade 3: one patient) [&lt;ulink linkID="491853" linkType="Reference"&gt;491853&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="492037" linkType="Reference"&gt;492037&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="493380" linkType="Reference"&gt;493380&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="496461" linkType="Reference"&gt;496461&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2004, data were updated at the 40th ASCO meeting in New Orleans, LA. From 32 melanoma patients treated for at least 6 weeks and evaluable for response, there were 11 partial responses, 10 of which were ongoing at 3 to 16 months. Median time to response was 3 months.

Patients (n = 20) with advanced solid tumors received sorafenib (100 to 400 mg bid) with gemcitabine administered at the standard dose of 1000 mg/m2. Hematological toxicities were non-dose limiting and consistent with gemcitabine effects. Non-hematological toxicities included decreased appetite, fatigue, hand-foot syndrome, skin rash, nausea and diarrhea. Only fatigue proved dose-limiting in one patient treated at the highest dose. Preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no significant interactions between sorafenib and gemcitabine.

The effects of sorafenib and &lt;ulink linkID="12973" linkType="Drug"&gt;sunitinib&lt;/ulink&gt;   on right ventricular (RV) remodeling in pulmonary artery banded (PAB)  or monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) rats were compared with placebo. Treatment with both drugs demonstrated a decrease in ventricular systolic pressure in the MCT model, a reversal of pulmonary vascular Remodulin, and a reduction in RV hypertrophy from 0.58 to 0.38 in sunitinib and 0.58 to 0.32 in sorafenib. Compared to placebo, both compounds after PAB reversed RV chamber and cellular hypertrophy, reduced RV fibrosis, and improved RV function by normalization of TAPSE to 2.51 in sunitinib to 2.46 in sorafenib [&lt;ulink linkID="1145390" linkType="Reference"&gt;1145390&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2005, preclinical data were presented at the 47th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA. In the in vitro kinase assay, sorafenib dose-dependently inhibited Raf-1 and B-Raf-mediated MEK1 phosphorylation, with Raf-1 kinase being more sensitive to sorafenib (IC50 value for Raf-1 of 1.37 microM vs IC50 value for B-Raf of 4.64 microM). In the AML cell lines OCI-AML3, HL-60, U937 and KG-1, 24-h treatment with BAY 43-9006 dose-dependently suppressed MEK1/2 and ERK phosphorylation. The compound also inhibited AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 after 4.5 h incubation. After 72-h incubation, IC50 values in OCI-AML3, HL-60, U937 and KG-1 cells were 0.39, 1.14, 2.86 and 2.80 microM, respectively. In vitro, in primary AML patient samples, sorafenib inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis after 48- to 72-h incubation, and also inhibited colony formation of AML progenitor cells compared to normal bone marrow cells (IC50 values of 2.33 vs 9.34 microM CFU-GM; 5.69 erythroid, and 3.75 microM mixed, respectively). At different incubation time points, sorafenib suppressed phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (at 4.5 h), caused loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome C release (at 6 h), followed by cleavage of caspases-3 and -9 but not of caspase-8. After 48 h, Bim and Bax were upregulated; however, the level of survivin was downregulated [&lt;ulink linkID="640905" linkType="Reference"&gt;640905&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2006, further data were reported at the 48th ASH meeting in Orlando, FL. Sorafenib was found to potently inhibit the tyrosine kinase ETV6-PDGFR. The drug also blocked cell cycle and apoptosis in the AML cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-13, however imatinib-resistant mutants were also resistant to sorafenib [&lt;ulink linkID="749242" linkType="Reference"&gt;749242&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2005, preclinical data were presented at the 17th AACR-NCI-EORTC meeting in Philadelphia, PA. Sorafenib (40 and 80 mg/kg) produced decreases in tumor volume of 63 and 93%, respectively, in a mouse anaplastic thyroid carcinoma xenograft model [&lt;ulink linkID="634978" linkType="Reference"&gt;634978&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Sorafenib (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg po qd ) was administered to mice with established PLC/PRF/5 HCC tumors (140 to 160 mg) for 14 days. The highest dose produced partial tumor regressions in 50% of the mice [&lt;ulink linkID="636153" linkType="Reference"&gt;636153&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="637464" linkType="Reference"&gt;637464&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In another study, sorafenib (1 to 9 nM) was shown to inhibit the proliferation of FLT3-ITD-expressing MV4-11 and EOL-1 leukemic cells, inducing ell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In a NCr nude mouse model of subcutaneously-grown MV4-11 tumors, sorafenib (3 and 10 mg/kg, po, for 14 days) induced complete regression of 60 and 90% tumors, at respective doses [&lt;ulink linkID="594772" linkType="Reference"&gt;594772&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Also in April 2005, further data were presented at the 96th AACR meeting in Anaheim, CA.  This was a comparative study carried out by &lt;ulink linkID="13601" linkType="Company"&gt;Abbott Laboratories&lt;/ulink&gt; analyzing the inhibition of CSF-1R signaling in enzymic and cellular assays, and comparing their inhibitor, &lt;ulink linkID="53059" linkType="Drug"&gt;ABT-869&lt;/ulink&gt;, with sorafenib. Sorafenib was found to be less potent but still inhibited the autophosphorylation of CSF-1R at  submicromolar levels [&lt;ulink linkID="596245" linkType="Reference"&gt;596245&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2005,  data were presented at the 96th AACR meeting in Anaheim, CA. In syngenic mice bearing K1735 melanoma cells, sorafenib (30 mg/kg) administered for 4 weeks controlled tumor growth with only 30% of tumors reaching 1.2cm3 compared with all untreated and most control mice. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed large areas of necrosis in sorafenib-treated tumors compared with control tumors [&lt;ulink linkID="596080" linkType="Reference"&gt;596080&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Sorafenib-induced cell death was detectable &amp;lt; 16 h after initiation of treatment in melanoma cell lines and was associated with Bak and Bax activation and downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [&lt;ulink linkID="597766" linkType="Reference"&gt;597766&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, preclinical data were presented at the 94th AACR meeting, Washington, DC, showing that a combination of sorafenib plus either &lt;ulink linkID="11603" linkType="Drug"&gt;gefitinib&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkID="6408" linkType="Drug"&gt;vinorelbine&lt;/ulink&gt; or &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; was tolerated and was at least as efficacious as the individual agents [&lt;ulink linkID="484235" linkType="Reference"&gt;484235&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further  data were presented from studies which looked specifically at the sensitivity of cell lines expressing mutated B-Raf. The melanoma cell lines SK-MEL28 and A2058 express a B-RAF gene that is mutated such that a V599E mutation causes constitutive activation of the MAP kinase pathway. This pathway is activated through an oncogenic N-RAS gene in the cell line SK-MEL2 which harbors no B-RAF mutation. Sorafenib inhibited the proliferation and ERK phosphorylation of all three of these melanoma cell lines with similar low micromolar IC50 values. In the colorectal cell lines HCT116 (K-RAS mutant), HT29 (B-RAF mutant) and Colo205 (B-RAF mutant), proliferation and ERK phosphorylation were also inhibited by sorafenib concentrations below 5 microM [&lt;ulink linkID="484237" linkType="Reference"&gt;484237&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Another study indicated that Raf Kinase activity might be important for &lt;ulink linkID="3792" linkType="Drug"&gt;oxaliplatin&lt;/ulink&gt;-induced cytotoxicity, and that lacking cross-resistance between SN-38 and Raf kinase inhibitors might provide a rationale for designing trials using CPT-11 in combination with sorafenib in patients with colorectal cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="497587" linkType="Reference"&gt;497587&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, further  data were presented at the 94th AACR meeting, Washington, DC. Animals bearing established sc DLD-1 human colon tumor xenografts were treated with a single 10-day course of sorafenib at 80 mg/kg. Treatment inhibited tumor growth. Further, tumors that were initially growth-inhibited with sorafenib were also responsive to a second course of therapy initiated after treatment cessation and subsequent resumption of tumor growth. It was further demonstrated that tumor growth delay was proportional to the duration of sorafenib treatment. In a separate study in the same model, animals were treated with &lt;ulink linkID="2871" linkType="Drug"&gt;irinotecan&lt;/ulink&gt; or sorafenib, or both agents in combination. Irinotecan (40 mg/kg) and sorafenib (80 mg/kg) produced tumor growth delays of 7.4 and 10.4 days, respectively when administered as individual agents. Neither agent produced tumor regressions. Combination of these therapies produced 28.3 days tumor growth delay with 30 to 40% tumor regressions [&lt;ulink linkID="497884" linkType="Reference"&gt;497884&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2002,  data were presented at the 44th ASH meeting in Philadelphia, PA. The sensitivity of &lt;ulink linkID="11460" linkType="Drug"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cells Ba/F3 to sorafenib was assessed.

Two matched pairs of cell lines were used in the study; one pair consisted of wild-type and SN-38-resistant cells, and the others were wild type and p53-/-. The different protocols gave different activity profiles; weak-to-moderate antagonism was found when sorafenib and Taxol or 5-FU were present together throughout. Weak-to-moderate synergy was noted when the drugs were added sequentially (paclitaxel or 5-FU followed by sorafenib). Cytotoxic effects were independent of resistance to SN-38 or p53 status, and all phases of the cell cycle were inhibited by sorafenib alone regardless of its p53 genotype [&lt;ulink linkID="466294" linkType="Reference"&gt;466294&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2002, preclinical data were also presented at the 38th ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. It was demonstrated that this agent was well tolerated and showed good efficacy when used in combination with standard chemotherapeutics, including &lt;ulink linkID="2871" linkType="Drug"&gt;irinotecan&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkID="6408" linkType="Drug"&gt;vinorelbine&lt;/ulink&gt; or &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; in xenograft models [&lt;ulink linkID="453077" linkType="Reference"&gt;453077&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Also in May 2002, in vivo preclinical data carried out in human tumor xenograft models were presented at the 92nd AACR meeting [&lt;ulink linkID="457966" linkType="Reference"&gt;457966&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="457966" linkType="Reference"&gt;457966&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Additional data presented also suggested that sorafenib acts by blocking the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway in tumor cells [&lt;ulink linkID="402452" linkType="Reference"&gt;402452&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In tumor xenograft models, the drug did not directly inhibit MEK1 or ERK1 activity [&lt;ulink linkID="403615" linkType="Reference"&gt;403615&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Raf and other members (such as Ras) of this pathway are attractive targets for development of antineoplastic agents because their aberrant activity has been heavily implicated in the onset of a variety of cancers. Consequently, targeted inhibition of these molecules, as mediated by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt;, has become a highly prioritized goal of oncological research [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="466338"&gt;466338&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Protein kinases possess enzymatic activity that enables intracellular signaling via a series of phosphorelay events. This intricate process is initiated upon ligand-receptor interaction at the cellular membrane. Kinase activation is then mediated through the removal of the gamma-phosphate group of ATP and subsequent transferral to a tyrosine, serine or threonine residue on its downstream substrate. Events such as these ultimately control mitogenic signals that facilitate alterations in nuclear gene expression.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;When properly regulated, the classical MAPK (Raf/MEK/ERK) pathway controls a variety of cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Figure 1). Genetic mutations can, however, lead to overexpression or aberrant activity of a particular MAPK. Furthermore, it is widely known that MAPK hyperactivity can lead to tumorigenesis. Thus, development of pharmacological agents that target individual activated oncogenes such as Raf has become the top-priority goal of molecular biologists worldwide [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="466338"&gt;466338&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="466340"&gt;466340&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; is a relatively novel compound that is currently being explored as an antineoplastic agent in a variety of tumor types.

Similar Raf-directed agents have been under investigation elsewhere including GW-374 (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="21948"&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;), a Raf inhibitor for the treatment of malignant neoplastic diseases that inhibits 50% of Raf activity at a concentration range of between 20 to 80 nM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="322280"&gt;322280&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="322585"&gt;322585&lt;/ulink&gt;] and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17771"&gt;L-779450&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18077"&gt;Merck &amp;amp; Co Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;), a Raf-specific inhibitor with an astonishingly low IC50 value of between 2 and 4 nM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="285016"&gt;285016&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="337456"&gt;337456&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Only &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; seems to be currently in development, however; there has been no development reported on GW-374 and L-799450 since February 2000 and August 1999, respectively.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; [N-(3-trifluoromethyl-4-chlorophenyl)-N'-(4-(2-methylcarbamoyl-pyridin-4-yl)oxyphenyl)urea] was identified through a series of reactions that originated with a commercially available p38MAPK inhibitor, GK-00687. High-throughput screening analysis identified GK-00687, a 3-thienyl urea, as a putative Raf-1 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 17 microM. A 4-methyl substitution of the phenyl ring of GK-00687 was noted to increase Raf-1 inhibition by 10-fold (IC50 = 1.7 microM). Further 'multiple-point modifications' were then created using an undescribed combinatorial chemistry approach, giving rise to the first-generation lead compound, N-(5-tert-butyl-3-isoxazolyl)-N'-(4-phenoxyphenyl)urea with an IC50 value of 1.13 microM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="390882"&gt;390882&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="471721"&gt;471721&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A different binding orientation was predicted for this lead compound because it did not match the SAR established for GK-00687 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="425815"&gt;425815&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="471721"&gt;471721&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The inhibitory efficacy of N-(5-tert-butyl-3-isoxazolyl)-N'-(4-phenoxyphenyl)urea was then improved by two primary chemical modifications. Introduction of an amide at the meta position of the distal phenyl ring was shown to increase inhibition of Raf-1. Additionally, replacing the distal phenyl ring with a pyridine ring was also shown to increase potency of the drug. These modifications, as well as other minor chemical alterations gave rise to the second-generation inhibitor, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; (IC50 = 12 nM) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="402451"&gt;402451&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="408527"&gt;408527&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="463753"&gt;463753&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="471721"&gt;471721&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Specificity of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; against Raf-1 was determined by screening against a panel of various other kinases including MEK-1, ERK-1, epidermal growth factor receptor and human insulin receptor. These studies added credence to the notion that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; inhibits Raf-1 with no apparent effect against other protein kinases [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="463772"&gt;463772&lt;/ulink&gt;].

The achieved levels of drug (&gt; 50 microM at 100 mg/kg) were significantly higher than the reported IC50 for in vitro HCT116 colon tumor cell inhibition (4.6 microM), suggesting that oral administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; is feasible for efficient drug delivery and cellular uptake [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="471718"&gt;471718&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="471765"&gt;471765&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Studies involving patients treated with 50, 100, and 200 mg doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; yielded Cmax values ranging from 0.74 to 3.6 mg/l after 2 to 14 h. An AUC range of 19 to 100 mg/h/l and a t1/2 of 35 to 36 h was observed, which leads to longer periods of bioavailability. These data concluded a dose linearity range of between 50 and 100 mg [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="404504"&gt;404504&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="409891"&gt;409891&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Follow-up studies generated comparable data, including Cmax values ranging from 0.42 to 0.66 mg/l and AUC(0 to 24 h) values of between 5.9 and 8.72 mg/h/l [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="436946"&gt;436946&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Using data derived from a ten-patient cohort, another group reported an AUC value of 27 mg/h/l, Cmax of 4.3 mg/l, Tmax of 2.5 h, and a terminal t1/2 of 23 h when &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; was administered orally at 100 mg/day [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="436952"&gt;436952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At 200 mg/day, reported AUC(0 to 12 h) and Cmax values rose to 47 mg/h/l and 6.7 mg/l, respectively, while Tmax remained similar at 2 h [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="430134"&gt;430134&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Despite progression of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; into phase II trials, the pharmacokinetic studies discussed above may require further investigation as substantial interpatient variabilities are evident. Namely, significant differences have been reported in Cmax, Tmax, and AUC values across each of the phase I trials. For instance, after a single 100-mg dose, AUC(o to 24 h) values in a cohort of 22 patients were reported with a coefficient of variation of 70% [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="471717"&gt;471717&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Conversely, the t1/2 of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; appears to be less variable; most reports approximate the t1/2 to be between 22 and 27 h. Notwithstanding these apparent variabilities, it can be generally stated that increased administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt;, either in frequency or dose, correlates to heightened Cmax and AUC values.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;The current literature reflects very few animal studies involving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt;; nevertheless, no toxicities were reported in these studies [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="463774"&gt;463774&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;Safety was measured as a function of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; pharmacokinetics in four different phase I trials [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="471717"&gt;471717&lt;/ulink&gt;] with particular emphasis placed on toxicology profiles and maximum tolerated doses (MTDs). A total of 12 advanced-cancer patients received &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; (50 to 400 mg) once per week, and their physiological response was monitored. No toxicities were observed and two patients incurred stable disease (hepatocellular cancer) lasting over 3 months [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="404504"&gt;404504&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Another trial consisting of 17 patients with advanced refractory solid tumors was performed using dose-escalation studies to determine the MTD and resultant toxicities over a 5-week period. Four different cohorts were treated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; at 50 to 100 mg every 1 to 4 days. Results were promising with no toxicities noted and, as a result, the future recommended dose was set at 200 mg/day [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="436946"&gt;436946&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Moreover, prolonged stabilization (&gt; 3 months) of disease was demonstrated in 33% of patients treated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; in these trials [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="430134"&gt;430134&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="409891"&gt;409891&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Final results of phase I trials surmised that the median duration of disease stabilization in response to treatment was 5.7 months, toxicities were minimal and inhibition of downstream kinase activation (ERK) was evident at doses of 200 mg bid [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="451786"&gt;451786&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="453133"&gt;453133&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; was administered orally to 38 evaluable patients, 3 weeks out of 4 at doses ranging from 50 mg/day to 800 mg twice daily. In three patients given 600 mg twice daily, tumor shrinkage was approximately 20% and one renal patient achieved a partial response [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="470750"&gt;470750&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a trial of 62 advanced-cancer patients diagnosed with refractory malignancies, who had mostly been heavily pretreated, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; (100 to 800 mg) was administered weekly then daily. The continuous dose-limiting toxicities were diarrhea in two of six patients given 800 mg and skin toxicity at 600 mg. Partial remission was sustained (47+ weeks) following 20 weeks of treatment at 400 mg twice daily. Stable disease (&gt; 3 months) was seen in 20 patients. Median time to progression was = 9 weeks in patients with colorectal cancer and 16.3 weeks in patients with HCC [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="470754"&gt;470754&lt;/ulink&gt;]. An additional phase I study found the MTD to be 600 mg twice daily and a recommended dose for phase II studies was 400 mg twice daily [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="470763"&gt;470763&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="470982"&gt;470982&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="472845"&gt;472845&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This was confirmed by a trial in 126 patients with a variety of cancers administered &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; (200 to 800 mg bid) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="457966"&gt;457966&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The dose threshold for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; was assessed in a trial of 66 patients. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), monitored by flow cytometry, in peripheral blood lymphocytes was used as a marker of drug effect. The dose threshold was established to be 200 mg twice daily; this increased proportionally up to 400 mg twice daily, beyond which the drug reached saturation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="466294"&gt;466294&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;Two phase II clinical trials of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; as a single agent in patients with hepatocellular cancer and colorectal cancer commenced towards the end of 2002 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="463092"&gt;463092&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="477364"&gt;477364&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="14455"&gt;Bayer&lt;/ulink&gt; and Onyx also report that multiple ongoing phase I/II clinical trials focused on studying &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; in combination with a range of standard chemotherapeutics are planned [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="463092"&gt;463092&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="477364"&gt;477364&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No data on these phase II trials are currently available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;From the results to date, toxicity profiles from phase I trials have generated promising results and some earlier reports describe no apparent toxicities [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="404504"&gt;404504&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="409891"&gt;409891&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="427755"&gt;427755&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="436952"&gt;436952&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="470982"&gt;470982&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In more recent reports, however, mild toxicities were observed, including diarrhea (two out of six patients at 1600 mg/day &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt;), pruritus, anorexia, low-grade anemia, fatigue, nausea, and flatulence [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="451786"&gt;451786&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452880"&gt;452880&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="436946"&gt;436946&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="451999"&gt;451999&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This palpable discrepancy is most likely to be attributable to the varying dosage regimens that were the focus of these phase I trials.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Pharmacological agents directed against specific kinases hold much therapeutic promise in cancer therapy. For example, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; mesylate, an inhibitor of the BCR-ABL transgene product, has achieved much acclaim for its efficacy in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. As individualized gene expression profiling becomes more commonplace in clinical oncology, the demand for chemical inhibitors against an array of signaling molecules will continue to rise. Given the overwhelming number of neoplasia with Ras and/or Raf mutations, the targeted disruption of aberrant signaling mediated by these proteins has become an increasingly attractive goal. Accordingly, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; is not the sole Raf-directed drug that has been investigated; GW-374 and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17771"&gt;L-779450&lt;/ulink&gt; are also Raf inhibitors, although there have been no recent developments reported on these compounds. Despite the overlapping nature of their functions, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; appears to hold the most immediate therapeutic potential because of its advanced stage of research development and substantial financial backing [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="463092"&gt;463092&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In spite of encouraging preliminary results reported at various scientific meetings, very few peer-reviewed, data-based publications exist for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt;. It is, therefore, difficult to accurately assess the potential success of the drug in cancer therapy. Consequently, a concerted effort should be made to publish verifiable data, not only in meeting abstracts, but also in peer-reviewed journals.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Additionally, peer-review might also trigger the exploration and discussion of issues that remain unanswered concerning the development of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt;. For example, three isoforms of Raf exist: A-Raf, and B-Raf and c-Raf (Raf-1). For appropriate applications of the drug, it would be interesting to determine the specificity of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="29831"&gt;BAY-43-9006&lt;/ulink&gt; against each of these isoforms, as their levels of kinase activity and tissue expression differ. Furthermore, additional protein-level, mechanistic research is necessary to determine the exact pharmacological action of the drug. Data derived from these types of studies could then be further utilized to develop high-efficacy, alternative inhibitors for Raf and other activated oncogenes.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="14455">Bayer AG</Company><Country id="JP">Japan</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="L"
