anti-IL-5 mAb which binds circulating IL-5  and modulates growth and chemotaxis of eosinophils. The product is indicated in the US for add-on maintenance treatment of patients with severe asthma aged 18 years and older, and with an eosinophilic phenotype [&lt;ulink linkID="1745998" linkType="Reference"&gt;1745998&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the EU, the product is indicated as an add-on therapy in adults with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="1789260" linkType="Reference"&gt;1789260&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2016, the drug was launched in the US for severe eosinophilic asthma [&lt;ulink linkID="1763036" linkType="Reference"&gt;1763036&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In   September 2016; the drug was launched in the UK [&lt;ulink linkID="1884830" linkType="Reference"&gt;1884830&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in November 2016, launch began in other European countries [&lt;ulink linkID="1900912" linkType="Reference"&gt;1900912&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The mAb was previously being developed for hypereosinophilic syndrome, nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EE). In June 2003, a phase I/II trial for hypereosinophilic syndrome was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="859033" linkType="Reference"&gt;859033&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The indication was listed on Ception's website in December 2007 [&lt;ulink linkID="859492" linkType="Reference"&gt;859492&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By 2006, results from a phase I nasal polyposis trial in patients were released [&lt;ulink linkID="778964" linkType="Reference"&gt;778964&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, no developments have been reported for hypereosinophilic syndrome and nasal polyposis indications since that time. In March 2008, a phase II/III trial in EE patients began [&lt;ulink linkID="882863" linkType="Reference"&gt;882863&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in November 2009, results were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="1059545" linkType="Reference"&gt;1059545&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, in February 2016, this indication was no longer listed as under investigation [&lt;ulink linkID="1777847" linkType="Reference"&gt;1777847&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Schering-Plough was formerly developing reslizumab for asthma.

In February 2015, Teva stated that reslizumab was protected by patents in  Europe which expired in 2015 [&lt;ulink linkID="1642825" linkType="Reference"&gt;1642825&lt;/ulink&gt;]. WO2012083370 has also been filed, claiming modified isolated antibodies that specifically bind to IL-5 (hu39D10) or CD33 (huMab195);  it had  EP patents pending as of October 2016, which would expire in December 2031 if granted. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/PatentsAndGenerics&gt;</value></PatentsAndGenerics><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2015, reslizumab was submitted for approval in the US in the treatment of severe asthma with eosinophilia [&lt;ulink linkID="1735082" linkType="Reference"&gt;1735082&lt;/ulink&gt;]. June 2015, a BLA was accepted for review by the FDA based on data from the phase III BREATH clinical trial program; at that time,  FDA regulatory action was expected in March 2016  [&lt;ulink linkID="1670214" linkType="Reference"&gt;1670214&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2015, an FDA advisory committee voted in favor of approval in the treatment of severe asthma in patients aged 18 years and older; however, the panel voted unanimously that the drug should not be approved for children aged 12 to 17 years [&lt;ulink linkID="1720249" linkType="Reference"&gt;1720249&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1720351" linkType="Reference"&gt;1720351&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In April 2016, the product was launched [&lt;ulink linkID="1763036" linkType="Reference"&gt;1763036&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2018, Teva filed an sBLA for revision to the drug's label to allow for infusion of the drug in a home healthcare setting by a healthcare provider prepared to manage the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis; in January 2019, the sBLA was approved [&lt;ulink linkID="2123287" linkType="Reference"&gt;2123287&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By March 2008, the drug had received FDA Orphan Drug status for the eosinophilic esophagitis [&lt;ulink linkID="882863" linkType="Reference"&gt;882863&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In January 2011, the FDA awarded the drug Orphan status for hypereosinophilic syndrome [&lt;ulink linkID="1260432" linkType="Reference"&gt;1260432&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;In  June 2015, Teva filed the drug for European approval for inadequately controlled asthma in adults with elevated blood eosinophils despite an inhaled corticosteroid-based regimen, and the EMA validated the filing [&lt;ulink linkID="1681293" linkType="Reference"&gt;1681293&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1735082" linkType="Reference"&gt;1735082&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in June 2016, the EMA's CHMP issued a positive opinion recommending EU approval in that setting  [&lt;ulink linkID="1775715" linkType="Reference"&gt;1775715&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1776026" linkType="Reference"&gt;1776026&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In   August  2016, the EC approved the  drug in  the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland    for inadequately controlled asthma in patients with elevated blood eosinophils despite an inhaled corticosteroid-based regimen plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment; at that time, launch was expected in the 'coming months'  [&lt;ulink linkID="1789260" linkType="Reference"&gt;1789260&lt;/ulink&gt;];  it was presumed that the product was made available in Iceland and Liechtenstein shortly after approval. UK launch took place in September 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1884830" linkType="Reference"&gt;1884830&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In March 2016, regulatory review in Canada was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1745871" linkType="Reference"&gt;1745871&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2016, reslizumab was approved by Health Canada for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who are inadequately controlled with medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and an additional asthma controller(s) (eg, LABA), and have a blood eosinophil count of &amp;gt;/=400 cells/microl at initiation of the treatment.

The patients would receive 1, 2 or 3 mg/kg of reslizumab or placebo iv on day 0 of each of four 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was improvement of clinical signs and symptoms and reduction of eosinophil count. At that time recruitment had not started [&lt;ulink linkID="839650" linkType="Reference"&gt;839650&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2008, the phase II/III trial began [&lt;ulink linkID="882863" linkType="Reference"&gt;882863&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2008, an invite-only, open-label extension phase III trial (&lt;ulink linkID="21947" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00635089&lt;/ulink&gt;; Res-5-0004) commenced [&lt;ulink linkID="979178" linkType="Reference"&gt;979178&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2009, results from the 226-patient, double-blind, randomized, phase IIb/III study were reported. Compared with placebo, all doses of reslizumab resulted in a significant reduction in peak esophageal eosinophils levels. Patients in all reslizumab groups experienced improvement in physician global assessment of symptoms, however, an unexpectedly large improvement was also seen in the placebo group, so the difference was not significant. Reslizumab was well tolerated. At that time, the extension trial was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1059545" linkType="Reference"&gt;1059545&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2010, results were expected in 1Q10 [&lt;ulink linkID="1074873" linkType="Reference"&gt;1074873&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Data were reported in May 2011 at the DDW meeting in Chicago, IL. At week 15, median reductions in peak esophageal eosinophil counts were 59, 67, 64, and 24% in the reslizumab 1, 2, and 3 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively. Improvement in physicians global assessment was seen in all four arms. Reslizumab was well tolerated, although one serious adverse event was observed in each of the four arms [&lt;ulink linkID="1189084" linkType="Reference"&gt;1189084&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Eosinophilic asthma&lt;/subtitle&gt;In November 2018, a pooled post hoc analysis results of two phase III studies (NCT01287039 and NCT01285323)  were presented at 2018 ACAAI Annual Scientific Meeting in Seattle, WA. Reslizumab provided statistically significant improvement in sleep quality, as measured by the three sleep-related questions of the AQLQ (sleep limitation, awakenings and sleep interference) relative to placebo in patients with inadequately controlled asthma. At week 16, improvement in sleep quality was observed with reslizumab and was maintained until week 52 [&lt;ulink linkID="2118638" linkType="Reference"&gt;2118638&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the same conference, further results were presented. LS mean changes from baseline over time in weekly averages of daily morning PEF (l/min) in the placebo (n = 244), reslizumab (n = 245) in study 1; placebo (n = 232), reslizumab (n = 232) in study 2 were -5.99, 2.48, 7.50, 14.25 at week 1 and -2.57, 20.09, 14.03, 32.92 at week 52, respectively.

The primary endpoint was to evaluate the change from baseline in regional image (HRCT) based hyperinflation (iVlobes) and in iVaw after 12 weeks treatment with reslizumab compared to changes in the placebo group. At that time, the trial was expected to complete in July 2021 [&lt;ulink linkID="2081177" linkType="Reference"&gt;2081177&lt;/ulink&gt;]&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2018, clinical data from BREATH study program  comprised four 16–52-week, placebo-controlled, phase III studies (studies 1 to 4) and a long-term open-labelextension study (study 5) which evaluated the immunogenicity of reslizumab in patients with eosinophilic asthma were presented at the 28th ERS International Congress in Paris, France. In the four placebo-controlled Phase III studies, the overall  anti-drug antibodies (ADA) incidence with reslizumab 3 mg/kg was observed in 5.4%  of patients. Of these, an average of 40% of the ADA responses were transient. In the OLE study, the ADA incidence with reslizumab was reported in 4.8% of patients; 39% of the ADA responses were transient. Across all five studies, ADA titers for ADA positive samples were low ; the highest recorded titer was reported in a patient receiving reslizumab was 106 (linear scale), recorded in study 2. The maximal titers recorded in Studies 1, 3, 4 and 5 were 15.1, 44.9, 60.5, and 33.3, respectively. Reslizumab concentrations in ADA-positive samples were comparable to those in ADA-negative samples in their median values and ranges, revealed the lack of impact of ADA on drug concentrations [&lt;ulink linkID="2072779" linkType="Reference"&gt;2072779&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2018, data from two phase III studies which evaluated the efficacy of reslizumab, an anti-IL-5 mAb, in asthmatic patients short-term variability in blood eosinophil levels were presented at the 28th ERS International Congress in Paris, France. Patients who received iv reslizumab 3 mg/kg or placebo q4w for one year were grouped into patients with &amp;gt;/= 1 eosinophil counts &amp;lt; 400 cells/microl and all eosinophil counts &amp;gt;/= 400 cells/microl during screening and at baseline(n = 311 and 642, respectively). The reductions in CAE rate ratio with reslizumab versus placebo was 0.49 and 0.45 in patients with &amp;gt;/= 1 eosinophil counts &amp;lt; 400 cells/microl and all eosinophil counts &amp;gt;/= 400 cells/microl, respectively (both p &amp;lt; 0.0001). In both the groups, Kaplan-Meier plots show longer time to first CAE among patients receiving reslizumab than placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="2072871" linkType="Reference"&gt;2072871&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2018, clinical data from an open-label extension study were presented at the 28th ERS International Congress in Paris, France. A total of 781 patients progressed from two duplicates, 52-week, phase III, placebo-controlled trials to open-label extension study and were randomized (1:1) to receive reslizumab (3 mg/kg) or matching placebo (q4w) for one year. Among the patients who received placebo in the two placebo-controlled trials, reslizumab was found to be associated with improvement in the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ)-6 from baseline by – 0.442 (overall score) after 48 weeks in the open-label extension study. The mean Asthma Symptom Utility Index score (ASUI) was found to be improved with reslizumab (3 mg/kg, iv, q4w); the mean overall score from baseline was 0.087 after 48 weeks of treatment in the open-label extension study. In the reslizumab naïve open label extension group, the ASUI score was improved by 0.079 at 48 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="2072744" linkType="Reference"&gt;2072744&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In   May 2018, four-year longitudinal follow-up data from an OLE (&amp;lt;/= 2 years)  and a consecutive two-year open-label safety (OLS) studies (conducted at a single center in France) which evaluated the efficacy and safety of reslizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, were presented at the 2018 ATS International Conference in San Diego, CA. Patients (n = 7) who completed a 52-week placebo controlled trial (PCT) received iv reslizumab (3 mg/kg, q4w) in OLE and later in OLS study. Only a single patient was randomized to and received reslizumab in the PCT prior to enrolling in the two open-label studies. The clinical asthma exacerbation rate during the OLE and OLS were 1.5 and 1.4 per year, respectively. The most frequent adverse event (AE) in all PCT, OLE and OLS was asthma reported by seven, six and seven patients, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2035173" linkType="Reference"&gt;2035173&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2018, data from two 52-week placebo-controlled trials which evaluated the reslizumab, in patients with eosinophilic asthma, was presented at 2018 AAAAI Annual Meeting in Orlando, FL. Patients were randomized to receive iv reslizumab 3 mg/kg q4w or placebo (n = 477 and 476, respectively). Compared to placebo, reslizumab (at the first scheduled assessment 4 weeks after the first dose) resulted in FVC improvement of 128 mL (95% CI: 69, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Over 16 and 52 weeks mean treatment difference for reslizumab and placebo in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) 25 to 75%: was 102 mL (95% CI: 42, p = 0.0008) and 99 mL (95% CI: 158, p = 0.0012), respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2020887" linkType="Reference"&gt;2020887&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2019, further data of eosinophilic asthma patients without blood eosinophil response (n = 18) were presented at the 74th AAAAI Annual Meeting in San Francisco, CA. For non-responders/partial responders (n = 14), reslizumab treatment response was not statistically significant: clinical asthma exacerbation risk reduction (37%), mean FEV1 improvement (40 ml), ALQL improvement (0.255), and ACQ-6 change (0.027) (all p &amp;gt; 0.05 versus placebo) and was diminished versus overall population [&lt;ulink linkID="2124155" linkType="Reference"&gt;2124155&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. In reslizumab and placebo groups, ACQ-7 responders at week 4 were 282 and 231, respectively (mean treatment difference -0.219 (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and maximal ACQ-7 response rates at week 32 were 77 and 67%, respectively (mean treatment difference: -0.228, p &amp;lt; 0.001). In respective reslizumab and placebo groups, 66 and 57% patients were  AQLQ responders at week 16 (mean treatment difference: 0.210 (p &amp;lt; 0.0019)) and maximal AQLQ response rates were 73 and 63% at week 52 (mean treatment difference 0.317, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) [&lt;ulink linkID="2124135" linkType="Reference"&gt;2124135&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. In the reslizumab group, the proportions of patients who had zero exacerbations were increased among patients with early improvement in Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6)  or forced expiratory volume-one second  (FEV1) (73% each). Further data were presented at the same conference. After 4 weeks, the proportions of patients with shifts to a new EOS category increased with increasing baseline EOS levels (&amp;lt;400/ml 47%, &amp;gt; 400 – &amp;lt; 800/ml 47%, &amp;gt; 800 – &amp;lt; 1200/ml 67%, &amp;gt; 1200/ml 67%) with similar proportions at 16-and 52-weeks.

In patients who showed early improvement in both ACQ-6 and FEV1 had a complete exacerbation response rate observed were 77 versus 45% for placebo while reslizumab-treated patients not achieving early improvement in FEV1 and ACQ-6 rates of complete exacerbation response observed was 59 and 53%, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2124123" linkType="Reference"&gt;2124123&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2017, pooled post-hoc subgroup analysis data from two phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies (3081; NCT01270464 and 3082; NCT01287039), which evaluated the effect of reslizumab on blood eosinophil levels, in moderate-to-severe asthma patients with elevated blood eosinophils, were presented at the 2017 ATS International Conference in Washington DC. Patients in 3081 and 3082 study with blood eosinophil count &amp;gt;/= 400/microl at screening were randomized (1:1) to receive iv reslizumab (3 mg/kg; q4w, 4 and 13 doses, respectively; n = 76) or placebo (n = 72) over 16- and 52-week period, respectively. Following first infusion of reslizumab, blood eosinophil levels were decreased by approximately 80% from baseline to week 2 to 3, which was not observed in placebo-treated patients. Through week 16 of reslizumab treatment, blood eosinophil levels remained low; and this reduction in blood  eosinophil levels was sustained throughout the 52 weeks of study 3082 (55/microl at week 52) [&lt;ulink linkID="1929598" linkType="Reference"&gt;1929598&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further subgroup analysis data in omalizumab-eligible patients (n = 146) were presented at the same conference Compared with omalizumab-eligible patients receiving placebo, patients receiving reslizumab had lower annualized rate of clinical asthma exacerbation (adjusted CAE rate was 1.37 and 0.80, respectively); greater improvements in FEV1 (least square mean change from baseline at week 52 was 129 and 302 ml, respectively); greater improvements in ACQ-6 scores (mean change from baseline at week 52 was -0.89 and -1.26, respectively); and greater improvements in Asthma Quality Of Life Questionnaire  scores (mean change from baseline at week 52 was 0.90 and 1.26, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkID="1929556" linkType="Reference"&gt;1929556&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2016, an open-label, phase II study (&lt;ulink linkID="277727" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02947945&lt;/ulink&gt;; HS-3025; RITE) was to begin in December 2016 to assess the efficacy and safety of reslizumab in patients (expected n = 10) with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Improvements in FEV1 with reslizumab above placebo during 52 weeks were 110, 88 and 167 ml in the overall patient population, patients with age of asthma onset &amp;lt; 40 years and patients with age of asthma onset &amp;gt;/= 40 years, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1700103" linkType="Reference"&gt;1700103&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1698015" linkType="Reference"&gt;1698015&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2018, further data were presented at the 2018 AAAAI Annual Meeting in Orlando, FL. Reslizumab-treated patients achieved FEV1 changes of &amp;gt;/= 430   to &amp;lt;/= 100 ml ; ACQ-6 changes of &amp;gt;/= -2.00 to &amp;lt;/= -0.67 and AQLQ changes of &amp;gt;/= 2.00 to &amp;lt;/= 0.44 [&lt;ulink linkID="2020831" linkType="Reference"&gt;2020831&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data of the association between asthma exacerbations and lung function were presented at the same conference. A trend towards lower FEV1 at baseline and greater FEV1 treatment effect over 52 weeks were observed in reslizumab versus placebo in patients with more historical CAEs; the difference over 52 weeks in patients with 1, 2, 3 and &amp;gt; 4 historical CAEs (n = 559, 193, 80 and 115, respectively) were 69 (p = 0.0124), 139 (p = 0.0140), 138 (p = 0.0494) and 205 ml (p = 0.0110), respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2020891" linkType="Reference"&gt;2020891&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the same conference, further data of the impact of reslizumab on duration of exacerbations were presented. The duration of CAEs requiring hospitalization and/or emergency room visit and/or systemic corticosteroids for &amp;gt;/= 3 days was significantly shorter in the reslizumab group compared with placebo in the overall population (15.4 versus 17.3 days, p = 0.0002) and in all four subgroups (subgroup 1:  adult patients with severe asthma (APSA; n = 744): 15.7 versus 17.5, p = 0.0021; subgroup 2: APSA and on high-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus another controller (n = 322): 15.8 versus 18.4, p = 0.0029; subgroup 3: APSA and &amp;gt;/= 2 exacerbations in the previous year (n = 307): 15.9 versus 18.2, p = 0.0058; subgroup 4: APSA and &amp;gt;/= 3 exacerbations in the previous year (n = 158): 15.9 versus 18.8, p = 0.0081)  [&lt;ulink linkID="2020895" linkType="Reference"&gt;2020895&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In week 52 FEV1 responders and non-responders, the mean treatment difference between reslizumab and placebo in AQLQ score was 0.285 (p = 0.001) and 0.203 (p = 0.0181), respectively; in ACQ-7 score was -0.318 (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and -0.120 (p = 0.0734), respectively; in blood eosinophil counts was -0.452 (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and -0.475 (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1961197" linkType="Reference"&gt;1961197&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1959393" linkType="Reference"&gt;1959393&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In October 2017, further data in patients with low lung function (percent predicted FEV1 &amp;lt; 50%; n - 186) were presented at the 2017 ACAAI Annual Scientific Meeting in Boston, MA. In reslizumab-treated patients, a mean increase from baseline in FEV1 of 409 ml was observed at the first time-point assessed (week 4), compared with a 219 ml change in placebo-treated patients. Over the 52-week treatment period with reslizumab, the rate of CAE was reduced by 53% compared with placebo (p = 0.0005) [&lt;ulink linkID="1998868" linkType="Reference"&gt;1998868&lt;/ulink&gt;].Further data on spirometric lung age were presented at the same conference. After 52 weeks of treatment with reslizumab, a greater improvement in mean lung age deficit, of around five years (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), was observed versus placebo.  At week 52, the mean improvement in lung age deficit in reslizumab and placebo-treated patients was - 8.7 and - 3.8, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1998885" linkType="Reference"&gt;1998885&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2018, further data from a subgroup of patients with baseline high body weight were presented at the 2018 ATS International Conference in San Diego, CA. The annual CAE rate for reslizumab versus placebo was 0.69 versus 1.40 (RR 0.50, reduction over 52 weeks of 50% (p = 0.0005). At week 52, in reslizumab and placebo groups, the mean change in FEV1 was 219 and 70 ml, respectively (p = 0.0123) and the mean change in % predicted FEV1 was 7.1 and 2.7%, respectively (p = 0.0095) [&lt;ulink linkID="2035100" linkType="Reference"&gt;2035100&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. Of 477 reslizumab- and 476 placebo-treated patients, 87 and 73% were responders (patients who met &amp;gt;/= 1 of the following criteria: &amp;gt;/= 10% FEV1 improvement or &amp;gt;/= 5% percent predicted FEV1 improvement, no CAE during the 52 weeks of study, or &amp;gt;1.5 improvement (reduction) of ACQ-6), respectively. Of these, 168 and 183 were moderate-responder, respectively; 165 and 117 were high-responder, respectively; and 80 and 48 were super-responder, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2035251" linkType="Reference"&gt;2035251&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data of the relationship between baseline blood eosinophil count and improvements in quality of life were presented at the same conference. In patients with baseline eosinophil level &amp;gt;/= 600, &amp;gt;/= 700 and &amp;gt;/= 800 cells/microl, the difference in AQLQ improvements between placebo and reslizumab at week-52 exceeded the minimal important difference (MID). Regardless of the baseline eosinophil level, the proportion of patients who achieved a MID of at least + 0.5 in the AQLQ score was consistently higher in the reslizumab than the placebo group [&lt;ulink linkID="2035103" linkType="Reference"&gt;2035103&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the same conference, further data were presented. At all time-points, reslizumab-treated patients had greater magnitude of change in eosinophil levels and in all efficacy outcomes (FEV1, ACQ-6, Asthma Symptom Utility Index and AQLQ scores) compared to placebo-treated patients. At all time points, reslizumab-treated patients had significant correlation between change in eosinophil count and all outcomes [&lt;ulink linkID="2035111" linkType="Reference"&gt;2035111&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later that month, further data on nasal AEs (NAEs) and upper respiratory-associated concomitant medication use  were presented at the 2018 EAACI Congress in Munich, Germany. A total of 245 patients reported nasal polyps; 124 in placebo and 121 in reslizumab arms, respectively. Placebo-treated patients reported more NAEs versus reslizumab treated patients (47 versus 34%). A total of 45 placebo-treated and 30 reslizumab-treated patients used upper respiratory-associated concomitant medications [&lt;ulink linkID="2063983" linkType="Reference"&gt;2063983&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In  May 2018, further results from  NCT01287039 were presented at the 2018 EAACI Congress in Munich, Germany.  A total of 303 and 177 patients were specific IgE positive and negative, respectively. In both subgroups, reslizumab-treated patients achieved statistically significant reductions in CAEs over 52 weeks versus placebo. Similarly, reslizumab-treated patients achieved statistically significant improvements in FEV1 over 52 weeks versus placebo in both subgroups [&lt;ulink linkID="2063986" linkType="Reference"&gt;2063986&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2018, further post hoc analysis data were presented at the 28th ERS International Congress in Paris, France. In the reslizumab versus placebo arms, LS mean change from baseline in ACQ-7 score at 52 weeks observed was -1.29 versus -0.96 (-0.339; p = 0.0006) in the low body weight group  and -1.05 versus -0.71 (-0.342; p &amp;lt; 0.0001) in the high body weight group in the overall population; -1.39 versus -0.95 (-0.436; p = 0.0002) in the low body weight group and -1.02 versus -0.60 (-0.420; p &amp;lt; 0.0001) in the high body weight group in GINA 4/5 subgroup population, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2072864" linkType="Reference"&gt;2072864&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further results were presented at the same conference.  In patients who received reslizumab versus placebo (treatment difference) with eosinophil cell counts of &amp;lt; 50, 50 to &amp;lt; 150 and &amp;gt;/= 150 cells/microl, CAE rate reduction from baseline to 52 weeks was 65, 60 and 32% with rate ratio of 0.35 (p = 0.0211), 0.40 (p = 0.0151) and 0.68 (p = 0.3210); in FEV1 (lung function) was +235 (p = 0.0214), +160 (p = 0.0431) and +54 ml (p = 0.4678); in ACQ score was -0.607 (p = 0.0016), -0.362 (p = 0.0230) and 0.146 (p = 0.3852); and AQLQ score was 0.785 (p = 0.0012), 0.514 (p = 0.0048) and 0.086 (p = 0.6924), respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2072801" linkType="Reference"&gt;2072801&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2019, further data were presented at the 2019 ATS International Conference in Dallas, TX. Greater increase in score in all four asthma quality of life questionnaire subdomains was observed with reslizumab versus placebo in both patients with eosinophils &amp;gt;/= and &amp;lt; 700 cells/microl; however, numerically larger effects observed in patients with eosinophils &amp;gt;/= 700 cells/microl compared to &amp;lt; 700 cells/microl [&lt;ulink linkID="2153244" linkType="Reference"&gt;2153244&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In  December 2010, a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, phase III study (&lt;ulink linkID="73558" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01270464&lt;/ulink&gt;; C38072/3081; 2010-023342-67) was initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of reslizumab in the treatment of patients (n = 315) with eosinophilic asthma. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in FEV1 at 16 weeks. The trial was completed in December 2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1591494" linkType="Reference"&gt;1591494&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1592193" linkType="Reference"&gt;1592193&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2014, data were presented at the 24th ERS Annual Congress in Munich, Germany. Reslizumab significantly improved asthma control in asthma patients with elevated blood eosinophils; the results would provide support for the eosinophil threshold of &amp;gt;/= 400 microg/l set for the phase III program [&lt;ulink linkID="1591494" linkType="Reference"&gt;1591494&lt;/ulink&gt;].   ​Further data  presented at this meeting demonstrated that overall FEV1 (p &amp;lt;/= 0.024) and asthma control questionnaire (ACQ; p &amp;lt;/= 0.033) were significantly improved with reslizumab compared with placebo. Improvements for reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg versus placebo were observed in both measures (153 ml, FEV1; -0.283, ACQ) as early as 4 weeks and maintained over the duration of the study. Asthma, headache, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, and upper respiratory tract infection were the most commonly reported adverse events across all treatment groups [&lt;ulink linkID="1591981" linkType="Reference"&gt;1591981&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2014, further data were presented at the 71st American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Meeting in Atlanta, GA. After 16 weeks of treatment, a statistically significant improvement over placebo in asthma quality of life questionnaire score was reported for the 3-mg/kg reslizumab dose, with a significant improvement in asthma symptom utility index also reported for both doses. Similar levels of adverse events were reported in all three groups [&lt;ulink linkID="1617546" linkType="Reference"&gt;1617546&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2010, a phase III program was planned for later that year following end-of-phase II discussions with the FDA [&lt;ulink linkID="1119683" linkType="Reference"&gt;1119683&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2010, phase III trials in eosinophilic asthma patients  had begun   [&lt;ulink linkID="1161925" linkType="Reference"&gt;1161925&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By January 2009, a phase II trial in adult eosinophilic asthma patients was underway [&lt;ulink linkID="976250" linkType="Reference"&gt;976250&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The treatment, randomized, double-blind, parallel assignment trial (&lt;ulink linkID="22300" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00587288&lt;/ulink&gt;; Res-5-0010) would assess the safety and efficacy of 3 mg/kg of reslizumab compared with placebo in 120 adult patients. The primary outcome would be data from an asthma control questionnaire. At that time, the trial was expected to complete in November 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="979181" linkType="Reference"&gt;979181&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2009, the trial was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1059545" linkType="Reference"&gt;1059545&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2010, results from the 106-patient study were reported. Patients had been treated once every 28 days over 4 cycles. At week 15, patients on reslizumab had improved asthma-control-questionnaire scores compared with those on placebo. Reslizumab-treated patients had a significant reduction in sputum eosinophil counts and significant improvements in FEV1 and FVC compared with the placebo group. There was also a significant mean improvement in ACQ and FEV1 in a subset of patients with asthma and nasal polyps who received active treatment, compared with those on placebo. Compared with the placebo group, fewer reslizumab-treated patients had clinical asthma exacerbations.  The drug was generally well tolerated with the most common adverse event being nasopharyngitis [&lt;ulink linkID="1076803" linkType="Reference"&gt;1076803&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2011, these data were presented at the 2011 AAAAI Annual Meeting in San Francisco, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="1180779" linkType="Reference"&gt;1180779&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1180365" linkType="Reference"&gt;1180365&lt;/ulink&gt;].
