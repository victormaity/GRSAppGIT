linkID="17808" linkType="Company"&gt;Ligand Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt; has developed and launched a capsule formulation of bexarotene (Targretin; LGD-1069; BSC-1), a retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective antitumor retinoid. The product is  marketed by licensees  &lt;ulink linkID="15872" linkType="Company"&gt;Eisai&lt;/ulink&gt;,  &lt;ulink linkID="17764" linkType="Company"&gt;Ewopharma&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkID="20348" linkType="Company"&gt;Teva&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkID="1153354" linkType="Company"&gt;Alfa Wassermann&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="16118" linkType="Company"&gt;Ferrer Internacional&lt;/ulink&gt;, US partner &lt;ulink linkID="17058" linkType="Company"&gt;Bausch Health&lt;/ulink&gt; (formely known as Valeant Pharmaceuticals) and Japanese  licensee    &lt;ulink linkID="18222" linkType="Company"&gt;Minophagen Pharmaceutical&lt;/ulink&gt;. In the US  and EU, bexarotene is indicated for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in patients who are refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy [&lt;ulink linkID="2110108" linkType="Reference"&gt;2110108&lt;/ulink&gt;],   [&lt;ulink linkID="2110111" linkType="Reference"&gt;2110111&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In Japan, the product is indicated for  the treatment of CTCL [&lt;ulink linkID="2110114" linkType="Reference"&gt;2110114&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Bexarotene capsules were launched by &lt;ulink linkID="17808" linkType="Company"&gt;Ligand Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt;  for    CTCL  in the US in  January 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="359023" linkType="reference"&gt;359023&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2002, the drug was launched in Germany and the UK for CTCL by Ligand's ex-European marketing licensee  &lt;ulink linkID="26414" linkType="Company"&gt;Elan Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt;  [&lt;ulink linkID="481938" linkType="Reference"&gt;481938&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1337733" linkType="Reference"&gt;1337733&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In February 2004, &lt;ulink linkID="1006337" linkType="Company"&gt;Zeneus&lt;/ulink&gt; (formerly Medeus; then a wholly owned subsidiary of  &lt;ulink linkID="15358" linkType="Company"&gt;Cephalon&lt;/ulink&gt;, now Teva) acquired Elan's European marketing rights, and began marketing Bexarotene capsules  [&lt;ulink linkID="609418" linkType="Reference"&gt;609418&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="613046" linkType="Reference"&gt;613046&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="642634" linkType="Reference"&gt;642634&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1230810" linkType="Reference"&gt;1230810&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By June 2006, the drug was available in several additional European markets, including Portugal,  Italy, Sweden,  Norway and Denmark [&lt;ulink linkID="1444818" linkType="Reference"&gt;1444818&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="1366264" linkType="Reference"&gt;1366264&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="591930" linkType="Reference"&gt;591930&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1414494" linkType="Reference"&gt;1414494&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1458599" linkType="Reference"&gt;1458599&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="1425966" linkType="Reference"&gt;1425966&lt;/ulink&gt;].  Ligand divested bexarotene capsules to Eisai in October 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="734608" linkType="Reference"&gt;734608&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="806952" linkType="Reference"&gt;806952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Licensee   Minophagen Pharmaceutical launched the product in Japan for the treatment of CTCL in June 2016    [&lt;ulink linkID="2110114" linkType="Reference"&gt;2110114&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The capsules were also being developed for the potential treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), advanced breast cancer, moderate-to-severe psoriasis and renal cell cancer (RCC). By January 2001, Ligand had initiated phase III trials in NSCLC [&lt;ulink linkID="423079" linkType="reference"&gt;423079&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in March 2005, Ligand reported that the primary endpoint  in the SPIRIT I and II studies had not been met, but the company would continue to evaluate the drug for the second- or third-line treatment of the disease. At that time, several additional trials were ongoing to assess bexarotene in different chemotherapy combinations, including &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; + &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="3803" linkType="Drug"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/ulink&gt;, for NSCLC in first-, second- and third-line settings  [&lt;ulink linkID="591930" linkType="Reference"&gt;591930&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In July 2005, a subset analysis revealed that bexarotene had benefit in NSCLC, with a significant correlation between high-grade (grade 3 and 4) hypertriglyceridemia and increased survival, potentially identifying a large subgroup patient population that may see a significant survival benefit of added bexarotene in first-line NSCLC therapy [&lt;ulink linkID="604020" linkType="Reference"&gt;604020&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At that time, discussions were ongoing to determine the next steps for bexarotene's development for NSCLC [&lt;ulink linkID="611118" linkType="Reference"&gt;611118&lt;/ulink&gt;].  Phase II trials for RCC and psoriasis were ongoing in June 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="526342" linkType="reference"&gt;526342&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="492427" linkType="reference"&gt;492427&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2004, phase II trials for breast cancer were ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="531460" linkType="reference"&gt;531460&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, no development in these indications has been reported for some time.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A &lt;ulink linkID="44237" linkType="Drug"&gt;gel formulation of bexarotene&lt;/ulink&gt; has also been developed and launched by Ligand. It was launched in the US for CTCL by year-end 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="423079" linkType="reference"&gt;423079&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><PatentsAndGenerics><displayLabel>Patents and Generics</displayLabel><value>&lt;PatentsAndGenerics&gt;&lt;para&gt;Exclusivity for bexarotene provided by &lt;ulink linkID="IN2182684" linkType="Patent"&gt;WO-09321146&lt;/ulink&gt; expired in March and April 2016 (including SPCs)  in Europe, began  to expire in July 2015  in the US, and by October 2013, had expired in Japan.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By December 2018, an authorized generic for Targretin had been launched [&lt;ulink linkID="2126953" linkType="Reference"&gt;2126953&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By August 2018, the US FDA had approved ANDA filings from &lt;ulink linkID="1120729" linkType="Company"&gt;Bionpharma&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkID="1062877" linkType="Company"&gt;Amerigen Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkID="21321" linkType="Company"&gt;Upsher Smith&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="1027030" linkType="Company"&gt;Amneal Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt; for generic versions of bexarotene capsules [&lt;ulink linkID="2110190" linkType="Reference"&gt;2110190&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, Amerigen Pharmaceuticals launched its bexarotene 75mg capsules [&lt;ulink linkID="2042309" linkType="Reference"&gt;2042309&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By January 2018, Biopharma, Amneal Pharmaceuticals and  Upsher Smith had launched their generic bexarotene capsule (75 mg) products [&lt;ulink linkID="2110206" linkType="Reference"&gt;2110206&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2110207" linkType="Reference"&gt;2110207&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2110211" linkType="Reference"&gt;2110211&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2011, Eisai received notice of &lt;ulink linkID="28592" linkType="Company"&gt;Banner Pharmacaps&lt;/ulink&gt;' ANDA filing with Paragraph IV Certification for bexarotene capsules (75 mg), asserting that the Orange Book-listed patents &lt;ulink linkID="IN2423500" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-05780676&lt;/ulink&gt; C1 and &lt;ulink linkID="IN2694283" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-05962731&lt;/ulink&gt; were either invalid, unenforceable and/or would not be infringed. In October 2011, Eisai filed a patent infringement suit against Banner in a US District Court, triggering a 30-month stay of the approval of Banner's ANDA. By December 2012, &lt;ulink linkID="28038" linkType="Company"&gt;Mylan Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt; had acquired certain rights for the ANDA and at that time was added as a defendant in the suit. In February 2013, Valeant acquired US rights to Targretin from Eisai, including to the US-5780676 C1 and US-5962731 patents and the NDA. In April 2013, the parties entered into a stipulation to add Valeant as a plaintiff in the proceedings. In December 2013, a settlement agreement was entered into, under which the pending litigation was dismissed, and Mylan and Banner received a license to begin selling their generic version of the product on July 9, 2015, or earlier under certain circumstances [&lt;ulink linkID="1531043" linkType="Reference"&gt;1531043&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2015, Mylan launched the first generic bexarotene capsule and received 180 days of marketing exclusivity  [&lt;ulink linkID="1676491" linkType="Reference"&gt;1676491&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2005, Ligand settled a patent dispute with The Burnham Institute and SRI International related to two patents exclusively licensed to Ligand, and now assigned to Ligand as part of the settlement. The company believed the settlement strengthens Ligand's intellectual property position for bexarotene [&lt;ulink linkID="604018" linkType="Reference"&gt;604018&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/PatentsAndGenerics&gt;</value></PatentsAndGenerics><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;Ligand filed an NDA for bexarotene capsules in June 1999, specifically for once-daily oral administration for the treatment of patients with early-stage CTCL who have not tolerated other therapies, patients with refractory or persistent early stage CTCL and patients with refractory advanced stage CTCL  [&lt;ulink linkID="329011" linkType="reference"&gt;329011&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The FDA's ODAC recommended approval in advanced-stage patients in December 1999, but recommended against approval in early-stage patients [&lt;ulink linkID="350382" linkType="Reference"&gt;350382&lt;/ulink&gt;], however the FDA approved bexarotene capsules in December 1999, for once-daily oral treatment of all stages of CTCL in patients refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy, at an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day [&lt;ulink linkID="351604" linkType="Reference"&gt;351604&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By June 1999, Ligand had received Orphan Drug designation for this indication [&lt;ulink linkID="329011" linkType="reference"&gt;329011&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;In November 1999, an MAA was filed with the EMEA for bexarotene capsules to treat lymphoma  [&lt;ulink linkID="348944" linkType="reference"&gt;348944&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2000, the CPMP recommended the approval of bexarotene capsules in Europe [&lt;ulink linkID="390580" linkType="reference"&gt;390580&lt;/ulink&gt;] and in April 2001, the EC granted marketing authorization; at that time,  launch was planned for later in 2001 [&lt;ulink linkID="403806" linkType="reference"&gt;403806&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In March 2001, the drug was approved in the Czech Republic [&lt;ulink linkID="1447623" linkType="Reference"&gt;1447623&lt;/ulink&gt;], and subsequently launched [&lt;ulink linkID="1444818" linkType="Reference"&gt;1444818&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2001, the drug was approved in Spain and by December 2012, it had been launched  [&lt;ulink linkID="1357231" linkType="Reference"&gt;1357231&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2002, the drug was launched in Germany and the UK for CTCL  [&lt;ulink linkID="481938" linkType="Reference"&gt;481938&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1337733" linkType="Reference"&gt;1337733&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2005, the drug was approved in Iceland [&lt;ulink linkID="1452117" linkType="Reference"&gt;1452117&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2005, the drug was launched in Portugal for CTCL  [&lt;ulink linkID="1366264" linkType="Reference"&gt;1366264&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By March 2005,   &lt;ulink linkID="17808" linkType="Company"&gt;&lt;/ulink&gt;it had been launched in  major European countries, including in   Italy   [&lt;ulink linkID="591930" linkType="Reference"&gt;591930&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2005, the drug was launched in Sweden [&lt;ulink linkID="1414494" linkType="Reference"&gt;1414494&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In May 2006, the drug was launched in Norway [&lt;ulink linkID="1458599" linkType="Reference"&gt;1458599&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In November 2015, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's Second Committee on New Drugs, Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council recommended approval of bexarotene for CTCL [&lt;ulink linkID="1717217" linkType="Reference"&gt;1717217&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2016, the drug was approved in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="1728963" linkType="Reference"&gt;1728963&lt;/ulink&gt;]. in June 2016, the drug was launched in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="2110114" linkType="Reference"&gt;2110114&lt;/ulink&gt;]&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2013, Minophagen obtained Orphan designation for bexarotene for the treatment of CTCL [&lt;ulink linkID="1400292" linkType="Reference"&gt;1400292&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;SAFETY INFORMATION&lt;/subtitle&gt;By June 2015, the US label contained a boxed warning highlighting the risk of birth defects in humans [&lt;ulink linkID="2110108" linkType="Reference"&gt;2110108&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Regulatory&gt;</value></Regulatory><Postmarketing><displayLabel>Postmarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Postmarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2009, a randomized, parallel-assignment, phase IV study (&lt;ulink linkID="61722" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01007448&lt;/ulink&gt;; E7273-G000-401) was initiated in the US to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of  two initial dose levels of bexarotene capsules in patients (n = 59) with refractory CTCL. The primary endpoint was tumor response at 24 weeks. In December 2014, the study was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="2116488" linkType="Reference"&gt;2116488&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 1999, at the request of the FDA, Ligand agreed to carry out certain post-approval phase IV and pharmacokinetic studies in patients with CTCL [&lt;ulink linkID="351604" linkType="reference"&gt;351604&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Postmarketing&gt;</value></Postmarketing><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Non-small-cell lung cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2001, Ligand planned to conduct two randomized phase III trials (SPIRIT I and II) of 600 patients each for the front-line treatment of NSCLC. SPIRIT I was to compare the combination of &lt;ulink linkID="51933" linkType="Drug"&gt;cisplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="6408" linkType="Drug"&gt;vinorelbine&lt;/ulink&gt; with the same combination plus bexarotene. SPIRIT II was to study bexarotene capsules in combination with &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="3803" linkType="Drug"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/ulink&gt;. Prior to starting this trial, Ligand was to conduct a tolerability study of 15 to 30 patients of the 3-drug combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel and bexarotene capsules to further define safety parameters for the phase III trial. A fourth trial was designed to study in 30 patients the pharmacokinetics and potential drug interactions of the two combinations used in the phase III program and was scheduled to start in mid-2001 [&lt;ulink linkID="402397" linkType="reference"&gt;402397&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="505430" linkType="reference"&gt;505430&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2003, enrollment in the SPIRIT I study was complete at 623 subjects. Ligand expected survival data from the study to be available in 1 year. At this time, SPIRIT II was 88% enrolled and accrual was expected to conclude early in the fourth quarter of 2003. Ligand also expected survival data to be available 1 year after full patient enrollment [&lt;ulink linkID="501082" linkType="reference"&gt;501082&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="581900" linkType="Reference"&gt;581900&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2003, the SPIRIT II study exceeded its enrollment goal ahead of schedule, with 612 patients recruited, and results were still expected during the following year [&lt;ulink linkID="505430" linkType="reference"&gt;505430&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="581900" linkType="Reference"&gt;581900&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2004, Ligand modified the statistical plan for the trial, such that survival data analysis was expected after 18 month or 456 deaths in the trial, not after 1 year as previously planned [&lt;ulink linkID="530143" linkType="reference"&gt;530143&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In August 2004, SPIRIT I and SPIRIT II were on schedule for final data analysis at the end of the first quarter of 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="552273" linkType="Reference"&gt;552273&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2005, Ligand reported that bexarotene had failed to meet the endpoints of improved overall survival and projected 2-year survival in SPIRIT I and II. An initial analysis of subgroups in the treatment arms of both trials suggested a relationship between bexarotene dose intensity and biomarker response with survival.  The combination regimens were generally well tolerated, although the incidence of neutropenia was greater than 1% in the SPIRIT I bexarotene arm. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events that occurred more frequently with bexarotene included hypertriglyceridemia in both trials, neutropenia, asthenia and dehydration in SPIRIT II and dyspnea in SPIRIT I  [&lt;ulink linkID="591930" linkType="Reference"&gt;591930&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2005, further data were presented at the 11th World Conference on Lung Cancer in Barcelona, Spain. Subset analysis of both trials showed that a group of patients developed high-grade hypertriglyceridemia early on during bexarotene treatment. Using this parameter as an index of sensitivity to bexarotene, it was possible to separate the bexarotene-treated population in two groups. Pooled data from both studies (595 bexarotene-treated patients) showed that the sensitivity subgroup (215 patients or 36% of all bexarotene-treated patients) had an overall survival of 12.3 months compared to 9.5 months for the non-sensitivity group. At that time, discussions were ongoing to determine the next steps for bexarotene's development for NSCLC [&lt;ulink linkID="611118" linkType="Reference"&gt;611118&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I/II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In September 2005, an interventional, non-randomized, single group assignment, open label phase I/II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="27245" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00153842&lt;/ulink&gt;; D-0109) was initiated in the US in patients (expected n = 33) with stage IIIB and IV non-small cell lung cancer to assess bexarotene  in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin. At that time, the trial was expected to complete in March 2009. In May 2009, the trial was terminated [&lt;ulink linkID="1881150" linkType="Reference"&gt;1881150&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2005, data from a proof-of-principle trial of bexarotene in patients with resectable NSCLC were presented at the 41st ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL, showing that bexarotene induced concentration-dependent repression of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, total EGFR, and phospho-EGFR (analysed in in vitro assays). In the study, subjects were given bexarotene (300 mg/m2/day po) for 7 to 9 days prior to surgical resection. Of the evaluable six patients who had paired pre- and post-treatment tissues, one demonstrated repression of cyclin D1 as well as a reduction of proliferation rate and one demonstrated repression of cyclin D3 without a significant reduction in Ki-67. These 2 patients demonstrated higher tumor tissue bexarotene concentrations (107 to 159 ng/g) than those who had no significant change in these biomarkers (3.7 to 74 ng/g) [&lt;ulink linkID="602349" linkType="Reference"&gt;602349&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2005,  phase II data of bexarotene capsules plus chemotherapy  were presented at the 41st ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. In the multicenter, single-arm NSCLC study, 112 of the planned 150 patients with 2 or more prior failed systemic treatments were enrolled. The patients were given bexarotene 400 mg/m2/day po plus supplementation with levothyroxine and a lipid-lowering agent. Interim analysis showed that the median survival was 5 months and the estimated 1-year survival was 13% for all the patients, and the median survival was 6 months and the estimated 1-year survival was 30% for patients with ECOG performance status 0 to 1, when given bexarotene 400 mg/m2/day po plus supplementation with levothyroxine and a lipid-lowering agent. No objective responses were reported. A total of 12 patients had stable disease, 67% showed improvement or no decline in quality of life, 11 discontinued bexarotene due to an adverse event and 1 death due to increased pulmonary infiltrate that was possibly related to bexarotene [&lt;ulink linkID="602291" linkType="Reference"&gt;602291&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were presented at the 42nd ASCO meeting in Atlanta, GA, in June 2006. Patients (n = 124) achieved a overall median survival of 5 months (6 months in patients who received at least 2 weeks of bexarotene) and a 1-year survival rate of 23%. Partial response was reported in one patient and quality of life, assessed by FACT-G, was improved or stabilized in 65% of patients. It was also confirmed that there were no therapy-related deaths [&lt;ulink linkID="670594" linkType="Reference"&gt;670594&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="671574" linkType="Reference"&gt;671574&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By March 2005, a trial was evaluating bexarotene monotherapy in 150 patients with NSCLC and a second trial was evaluating  bexarotene plus &lt;ulink linkID="11961" linkType="Drug"&gt;erlotinib&lt;/ulink&gt;. Two multicenter trials were also evaluating  bexarotene plus Taxotere as second-line treatment for relapsed NSCLC [&lt;ulink linkID="591930" linkType="Reference"&gt;591930&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2000, the company reported phase I/II trial results at the NCI-EORTC-AACR meeting in Amsterdam. Researchers found that bexarotene capsules plus chemotherapy yielded acceptable response rates, with better-than-expected survival in stage III/IV NSCLC patients. Patient survival with bexarotene capsules for actual 2-year survival was 32%, and the projection for 3-year survival is 30%. At the maximum tolerated dose of 400 mg/m2 body surface area per day, bexarotene capsules showed substantial activity in combination with a third-generation NSCLC chemotherapy regimen with a tolerable safety profile [&lt;ulink linkID="388937" linkType="reference"&gt;388937&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="389512" linkType="reference"&gt;389512&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="390085" linkType="reference"&gt;390085&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These results were also presented in May 2001 at the 37th ASCO meeting in San Francisco, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="410522" linkType="reference"&gt;410522&lt;/ulink&gt;], and long-term follow-up data showing median survival of 11.1 months (maximum 4.76 years) were also described [&lt;ulink linkID="410740" linkType="reference"&gt;410740&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="409260" linkType="reference"&gt;409260&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="417649" linkType="reference"&gt;417649&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2000, follow-up results from a phase I/II trial of bexarotene with a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen in patients with advanced NSCLC showed a 25% response rate and a 14-month median survival at the maximum tolerated dose determined in the phase I portion of the trial. Nine (32%) of the 28 patients remained alive at more than two years of follow-up. One-year survival by life table analysis was 61% and projected 3-year survival was 30% [&lt;ulink linkID="378890" linkType="reference"&gt;378890&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Renal cell carcinoma&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2001, phase I/II data presented at the 37th ASCO meeting in San Francisco, CA, suggested that bexarotene may be of benefit in combination with IFN in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma [&lt;ulink linkID="409121" linkType="reference"&gt;409121&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="410443" linkType="reference"&gt;410443&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In the randomized, placebo-controlled phase II cancer prevention trial, 37 women (aged 20 to 82) with a range of 11 to 100% risk of carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation were given bexarotene (200 mg/m2) or placebo for 28 days. Of the 69 samples, 52 were satisfactory for biomarker analysis. Epithelial cell adequacy rates increased over time. Of the 30 patients who had pre- and post-treatment biopsies, 19 of the paired samples from day 1 and day 28 biopsies were satisfactory and available for analysis. At that time, studies to determine whether bexarotene suppresses breast epithelial cell growth in high-risk women were to begin once accrual was complete [&lt;ulink linkID="601661" linkType="Reference"&gt;601661&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2004, clinical data on &lt;ulink linkID="11961" linkType="Drug"&gt;erlotinib&lt;/ulink&gt; in combination with bexarotene were presented at the 16th EORTC-NCI-AACR meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. In this phase I/II, dose-escalation trial, 20 patients with advanced aerodigestive tract cancers who had failed prior chemotherapy were administered erlotinib and bexarotene. A total of 16 patients were evaluable for response. Toxicities were mild with frequent occurrences of symptomatic elevations of cholesterol and triglycerides. No cases of pancreatitis were observed. One patient experienced a dose-limiting grade 3 rash and one patient had dose-limiting grade 3 diarrhea. By that time, there had been two partial responses and one minor response, one of which had lasted more than 1 year. Four patients had remained on the study with stable disease, two of which had demonstrated stable disease for more than 3 months [&lt;ulink linkID="564714" linkType="Reference"&gt;564714&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase II trial for breast cancer was initiated in November 1998. The open-label study was scheduled to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two dose levels of bexarotene, and was to enroll up to 180 patients at approximately 30 sites in the US. Patients were to be assigned to one of three groups, based on their prior treatment: where standard chemotherapy is no longer effective; where standard hormone therapy is no longer effective; and, where current treatment is with tamoxifen and the disease has progressed [&lt;ulink linkID="306937" linkType="reference"&gt;306937&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In March 2004, phase II trials for breast cancer were ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="531460" linkType="reference"&gt;531460&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase I/IIa dose-escalating trial comparing micronized or non-micronized formulations of oral bexarotene, no dose-limiting toxicities were reported. This trial determined tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics in 33 patients with advanced cancers, including non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CTCL, head and neck and other types of cancer. From the pharmacokinetic studies there was no evidence of auto-induced metabolism. The micronized formulation enhanced bioavailability significantly. For CTCL, two antitumor responses were reported. Seven patients showed stabilization of progressive metastatic cancer which was maintained for up to 6 months [&lt;ulink linkID="177824" linkType="reference"&gt;177824&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Psoriasis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2003, data were presented at the 61st annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology, in San Francisco, CA, which described results from three patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were treated with 75 mg qd bexarotene capsules and narrowband UVB phototherapy. All patients had previously been treated with a median of four therapies and had experienced an adverse event with a prior oral RAR retinoid. All patients responded to treatment, with one complete response and two partial responses of at least 90%. Signs and symptoms of psoriasis also improved significantly, with plaques being flattened or cleared within 1 to 2 months. Pruritis also improved, with no further reports by week 16. One patient experienced mild triglyceride elevation, which was treated with a lipid-lowering agent [&lt;ulink linkID="483190" linkType="reference"&gt;483190&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By August 2002, Ligand expected two trials in psoriasis to commence in the third quarter of 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="462722" linkType="reference"&gt;462722&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Phase II psoriasis trials were ongoing in June 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="526342" linkType="reference"&gt;526342&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2002, data presented at the Society for Investigative Dermatology showed that treatment with bexarotene capsules reduced the number of proliferating skin cells in 83% patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. In the study, patients received one of four doses of bexarotene capsules: 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 mg/kg/day. In the three highest dose regimens, mean cell proliferation decreased by more than 30% after 12 weeks of treatment. The five patients who had no significant reductions in proliferation while on therapy all received the lowest dose of bexarotene [&lt;ulink linkID="451518" linkType="reference"&gt;451518&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By 1999, Ligand was conducting a multicenter dose-ranging (0.5 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day) phase II trial with bexarotene capsules for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. By May 2000, 37 patients had been enrolled at four study centers in the Netherlands and Belgium in this open-label study [&lt;ulink linkID="365085" linkType="reference"&gt;365085&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="329011" linkType="reference"&gt;329011&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The results of this trial are expected during the second quarter of 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="359023" linkType="reference"&gt;359023&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2000, Ligand reported an interim analysis of three of the four dose groups. In these three groups, bexarotene capsules achieved at least 50% improvement, according to a Physician's Global Assessment, in up to 46% of patients after 12 to 24 weeks of therapy. Data from the 3 mg/kg/day panel are pending [&lt;ulink linkID="365085" linkType="reference"&gt;365085&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Bexarotene capsules have been generally well tolerated by patients with psoriasis, with a 17% rate of withdrawal due to treatment-related adverse events before completion of the 24-week treatment duration. The most common adverse events are hypertriglyceridemia and mucocutaneous dryness [&lt;ulink linkID="402397" linkType="reference"&gt;402397&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="329011" linkType="reference"&gt;329011&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Diabetes&lt;/subtitle&gt;In 1997, Lilly planned to investigate bexarotene in combination with insulin, and with thiazolidinediones, such as &lt;ulink linkID="2876" linkType="Drug"&gt;troglitazone&lt;/ulink&gt;. Trials on this combination therapy were expected in 1999 [&lt;ulink linkID="266583" linkType="reference"&gt;266583&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="275128" linkType="reference"&gt;275128&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, in 1999, Lilly elected not to proceed with the development of bexarotene [&lt;ulink linkID="315517" linkType="reference"&gt;315517&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 1997, Ligand initiated phase II trials in Europe for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The 12-week trial was to assess the metabolic efficacy, safety and tolerability of four dose levels of bexarotene capsules in 48 patients with NIDDM. Patients were to be randomly assigned to one of six groups, receiving bexarotene in doses ranging from 150 to 600 mg per day [&lt;ulink linkID="239654" linkType="reference"&gt;239654&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 1998, bexarotene was in phase III trials for the treatment of diabetes [&lt;ulink linkID="297497" linkType="reference"&gt;297497&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, no development was reported for bexarotene for this indication by December 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="423079" linkType="reference"&gt;423079&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In clinical trials bexarotene, unlike 9-cis-retinoic acid, did not cause elevation of triglycerides and cholesterol and did not reduce levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Levels of the anti-atherogenic apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) were substantially higher in patients receiving bexarotene, compared with those receiving 9-cis-retinoic acid [&lt;ulink linkID="176406" linkType="reference"&gt;176406&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II/III&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2000, data from two phase II/III, multicenter, international open-label trials of bexarotene in patients with refractory or persistent CTCL of TNM Stage I-IIA or TNM Stage IIB-IV were presented at the 36th ASCO meeting in New Orleans, LA. Data were analyzed for response and safety at initial doses of 300 and &amp;gt; 300 mg/m2/day. There were three patients with complete clinical response (CCR) at 300 mg/m2/day (stages IB, IIA and III) and nine patients with CCR at over 300 mg/m2/day (IA-3, IB-1, IIA-1, IIB-4). Serious adverse events at least possibly related to treatment occurred in 4% of patients at the lower dose and in 11% of patients at the higher dose [&lt;ulink linkID="368053" linkType="reference"&gt;368053&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2000, findings from two phase II/III trials were presented at the 58th American Academy of Dermatology meeting, indicating that bexarotene capsules benefit patients with both early- and advanced-stage refractory CTCL. The first, was a multicenter trial involving 94 patients with advanced-stage CLTL. The patients were given 300 mg/m2/day, reduced from an original starting dose of 650 mg/m2/day because of neutropenia and hypertriglyceridemia. A complete clinical response (CCR) with a median time to best response of 180 days was achieved by 49% of patients. Side effects were frequently observed at doses greater than 300 mg/m2/day. The second trial was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study involving 58 patients with early-stage CTCL. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two initial doses of bexarotene capsules (low = 6.5 mg/m2, high = 300, 500 or 650 mg/m2, depending on protocol version), to be administered once-daily. Only 20% of patients on the low dose responded at all; 54% of patients taking 300 mg/m2/day achieved CCR. Responses were greater with higher dose levels but there was also a greater incidence of side effects [&lt;ulink linkID="359462" linkType="reference"&gt;359462&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="365085" linkType="reference"&gt;365085&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The NDA was based on two phase II/III multicenter, open-label, controlled studies conducted in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia. By June 1999, 200 patients with CTCL had been treated, of whom 152 met the cutoff date for inclusion in the NDA: 38% of patients from the early-stage study and 62% from the advanced-stage study. A total of 84 patients with CTCL were treated at the initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day proposed for marketing [&lt;ulink linkID="329011" linkType="reference"&gt;329011&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A phase II/III trial to treat patients with various stages of CTCL demonstrated that bexarotene benefits patients with refractory advanced stage CTCL. The results of this trial were presented in December 1999, at the 41st ASH meeting in New Orleans, LA [&lt;ulink linkID="349653" linkType="reference"&gt;349653&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the preferred dose of 300 mg/m2/day there was a 45% response rate in refractory advanced stage CTCL patients and a 55% response rate at doses greater than this. Median duration of response was 23 weeks or 44 weeks at 300 mg/m2/day or greater, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="350256" linkType="reference"&gt;350256&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In 58 patients with refractory or persistent early-stage CTCL, 48% of patients achieved a complete or partial response at all dose levels, with a median time to first response of 57 days and 87 days median time to best response [&lt;ulink linkID="350678" linkType="reference"&gt;350678&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Oral bexarotene also reliably induced responses in erythrodermic CTCL refractory to conventional therapy. Palliation was dose responsive, and two patients of nine achieved complete remission [&lt;ulink linkID="350258" linkType="reference"&gt;350258&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 1999, Ligand released data from a pivotal trial of 152 patients with CTCL, demonstrating that at the initial dose level, bexarotene produced at least 50% improvement in 48% of patients according to the primary endpoint classification. The response rate for patients starting at doses greater than 300 mg/m2/day was 58%. At the date of closure for these trials, clinical complete responses were observed for 3.6% of patients in the 300 mg/m2/day initial dose group and 17% of patients in the over 300 mg/m2/day initial dose group. Both the 300 and the over 300 mg/m2/day initial dose levels were superior to the 6.5 mg/m2/day initial dose level, with a dose response relationship for response rate, rate of progressive disease and time to onset of progressive disease. Findings from the dose of 6.5 mg/m2/day did not meet the protocol-defined targets for efficacy. Additionally, for the 11 of 15 patients who crossed over from low-dose to high-dose therapy, disease progression noted on the low-dose was reversed and response criteria for at least 50% improvement were met in 55% of patients. Some patients had at least 50% improvement by the first assessment on bexarotene therapy, at 2 weeks, and the response rate was 12% within the first month. The projected median time to response was 16 weeks. Responses were generally durable, with a 28% rate of relapse over a median of 17 weeks monitoring, and a projected median time to relapse of 43 weeks. Bexarotene capsules, at an initial dose, were generally well tolerated. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred more frequently in patients at initial doses over 300 mg/m2/day than in patients in the 300 mg/m2/day initial dose group. The most common adverse events (with incidence of 25% and without regard to relatedness to study drug) in the 84 CTCL patients in the 300 mg/m2/day initial dose group were hyperlipemia (79%), hypercholesteremia (32%), headache (30%), hypothyroidism (29%) and pruritus (25%) [&lt;ulink linkID="329011" linkType="reference"&gt;329011&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I/II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In January 2012, a single-arm, randomized, phase I/II study (JPRN-UMIN000006744) of bexarotene capsules (BSC-1) was initiated in Japan in patients (estimated n = 16) with CTCL [&lt;ulink linkID="1401842" linkType="Reference"&gt;1401842&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2004, phase II data on a bexarotene and interferon alfa 2b combination were presented at the 46th ASH meeting in San Diego, CA. CTCL patients (n = 22) were treated with bexarotene 300 mg/m2/day for at least 8 weeks. If no CR was seen after treatment, interferon alfa-2b at a dose of 3 million units escalated to 5 million units sc 3 times weekly was added for another 8 weeks. Responding patients could continue treatment beyond 16 weeks. 17 patients completed 16 weeks of treatment and were evaluable; six PR, one CR (objective response rate 41%). Three of the six PRs occurred with bexarotene alone at 8 weeks. Median duration of response was 2.7 months. Reversible grade 3 or 4 toxicities seen in more than one patient were hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and elevated AST. Six patients died, all of progressive disease from following initiation of treatment. The major response rate for the combination of bexarotene and interferon alfa was similar to that for bexarotene alone. Further accrual was suggested though clinical usefulness of the combination is limited by the need for interferon injections [&lt;ulink linkID="573903" linkType="Reference"&gt;573903&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Results from a phase II study of bexarotene capsules and PUVA (psoralen-UVA therapy) in patients with early-stage CTCL were presented at the 61st annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology, in San Francisco, CA, in March 2003. Patients were randomized to receive bexarotene, at either 150 or 300 mg qd, in combination with PUVA for 24 weeks. At the time of analysis, 17 patients had completed at least 8 weeks of therapy and were evaluated for responses. Ten patients had a complete response, and five had a partial response with at least a 50% improvement. The overall response rate was 88% (15 of 17 patients). Elevations in triglycerides were expected, and patients were treated prophylactically with lipid-lowering agents. Four patients experienced hypothyroidism, which was managed with oral thyroid supplements [&lt;ulink linkID="483190" linkType="reference"&gt;483190&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2002,  it was shown that early-stage CTCL can be cleared rapidly by treating patients with bexarotene capsules and PUVA (psoralen and UV light). At the time of an interim study assessment (presumably a phase I study), six patients had completed at least 8 weeks of therapy with 150 or 300 mg/day of bexarotene in combination with PUVA. All six patients responded to treatment, with three showing a complete clinical response and three a partial response. The three patients with a complete response achieved remission after 6, 7 and 8 weeks of combination therapy, respectively. Mild elevations in triglycerides were observed in all patients, and were controlled by reducing the bexarotene dose or by increasing the dose of a lipid-lowering drug [&lt;ulink linkID="451518" linkType="reference"&gt;451518&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2001, phase I results showed that bexarotene enhanced the activity of &lt;ulink linkID="7237" linkType="Drug"&gt;denileukin diftitox&lt;/ulink&gt; in CTCL patients [&lt;ulink linkID="433176" linkType="reference"&gt;433176&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a multicenter phase I trial into the use of bexarotene in the treatment of CTCL, details of which were presented to the 41st ASH meeting, 58 patients were enrolled, 78% of whom were refractory to at least two prior therapies. The median time to response was 8.1 weeks and resolution of lymphocytic infiltrate was observed at 8 weeks. Overall response rate was 67%, with 27% complete response at 300 mg/m2.

Researchers exposed human breast cancer cells in culture (MDA-MB-231) to bexarotene and paclitaxel, both as monotherapies and in several combination regimens. After a single 3-day exposure, bexarotene did not enhance or inhibit paclitaxel's anticancer activity. However, after multiple exposures, the bexarotene/paclitaxel combination either significantly reduced or completely inhibited tumor cell growth. When paclitaxel was given intermittently and bexarotene continuously, no resistance developed after 100 days of treatment, and the growth of cancerous cells was completely inhibited. In contrast, after repeated exposures to paclitaxel alone, cancerous cells developed resistance to paclitaxel and cross-resistance to vincristine, vinblastine and doxorubicin. In terms of cancerous cells already resistant to paclitaxel and doxorubicin, they could be resensitized to treatment after multiple exposures of both the bexarotene/paclitaxel and bexarotene/doxorubicin combinations. Results from proof-of-principle studies in mice and rat models of breast cancer treatment showed that a bexarotene/paclitaxel regimen resulted in reduced tumor volumes and increased overall objective response rates and a decrease in overall tumor burden [&lt;ulink linkID="485075" linkType="reference"&gt;485075&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2002, results were published from a study in which bexarotene effectively suppressed the development of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative mammary tumors in mice, with minimal toxicity [&lt;ulink linkID="473603" linkType="reference"&gt;473603&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="473507" linkType="reference"&gt;473507&lt;/ulink&gt;]&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At the 220th ACS National Meeting in August 2000, Lilly disclosed work on a number of synthetic metabolites of bexarotene, notably 6-oxo and 7-oxo-bexarotene and racemic 6-hydroxyl and 7-hydroxyl-bexarotene. However, the reactivity of these compounds was shown to be greatly reduced relative to bexarotene itself and so the compounds have little significance clinically [&lt;ulink linkID="380581" linkType="reference"&gt;380581&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 1999, the company presented results of a preclinical study in a rat breast cancer model at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Diego, CA. The data showed that bexarotene caused complete regression in 72% of primary breast tumors in the model and that the induction of expression of fat-specific genes was present only in breast tumors responding to the drug.

Multiple, interacting cellular and tissue-level controls exist to suppress or even destroy malignant cells through control of replication, apoptosis and differentiation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386777"&gt;386777&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The retinoids have long excited interest as chemotherapeutic agents because of their actions in inducing differentiation, growth arrest and apoptosis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="217003"&gt;217003&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386851"&gt;386851&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, the action of retinoids is extremely complex and not well understood. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Retinoids act through both nuclear receptor-mediated and non-receptor-mediated mechanisms. The retinoic acid receptors are transcription factors that activate cassettes of genes when bound with the appropriate ligand [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386778"&gt;386778&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Retinoids bind to both the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) families of receptors, each of which is comprised of alpha, beta and gamma forms, and form homodimers with themselves or heterodimers with corresponding RXR receptors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="217003"&gt;217003&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386780"&gt;386780&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The RXR receptors/transcription factors also form heterodimers with a wide variety of other nuclear receptors/transcription factors, which probably helps explain the pleiotropic effects of retinoids [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386781"&gt;386781&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition to the retinoid receptors, certain retinoids can also inhibit AP-1, a transcription factor that regulates cellular replication [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386782"&gt;386782&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386784"&gt;386784&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The retinoids also act by other mechanisms, including induction of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria, which leads to apoptotic death [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="360633"&gt;360633&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386795"&gt;386795&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The regulation of the critical processes of cellular replication, differentiation and death occurs by a complex network of interlinked signaling pathways [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386777"&gt;386777&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Large numbers of genes possess retinoid-responsive elements that regulate their expression levels upward or downward. Many of these are other elements in the cellular network, such as steroid receptors and cell-surface receptors, as well as internal control elements of the cell cycle. Clearly, much of the complexity of this network is involved with producing cellular and tissue specificity. Broad-spectrum retinoids that show a high affinity for all of the receptors tend to display poor tissue specificity, relatively low activity, and a low therapeutic index. In an effort to improve the efficacy of retinoids, recent research has focused upon targeting specific retinoid receptors. Specific targeting of differentiation, which will halt replication and result in eventual apoptotic death, or of immediate apoptosis itself have been the objects of considerable research. Bexarotene represents the class of targeted retinoid derivatives and shows little activity for the RAR receptor class but high affinity for the RXR class of receptors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="192438"&gt;192438&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This class of compounds is often referred to as 'rexinoids'. Bexarotene is the first such compound to enter clinical trials for cancer indications.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;The compound was synthesized as one of a series of potent RXR-selective compounds [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="192438"&gt;192438&lt;/ulink&gt;], based upon the previous observation that (E)-4-[2-(5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid binds and transactivates only the RAR subtypes, whereas (E)-4-[2-(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8- tetrahydro-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid binds and transactivates both the RAR and RXR subfamilies. Addition of functional groups such as methyl, chloro, bromo, or ethyl to the 3-position of the tetrahydronaphthalene moiety of 4-[(5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl)carbonyl]benzoic acid and 4-[1-(5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl)ethenyl]benzoic acid produced compounds that selectively activate the RXR receptor class. Activation profiles in cotransfection and competitive binding assays, as well as molecular modeling calculations, demonstrate critical structural determinants that confer selectivity for members of the RXR subfamily. The most potent compound of this series was 4-[1-(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl)ethenyl]benzoic acid (designated as bexarotene). Ligand subsequently reported a systematic structure-activity study that identified other, similar compounds with even higher selectivity for RXR receptors and suggested that induction of apoptotic death of leukemic cells involved activation of RXR receptors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="191009"&gt;191009&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The synthesis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="192438"&gt;192438&lt;/ulink&gt;] proceeds with an overall 41% yield starting from a Friedel-Crafts condensation of toluene and 2,5-dichloro-2,5-dimethylhexane (91% yield) followed by acylation with monomethylterephthalic acid chloride (72% yield). The carbonyl group is condensed with methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide to the ethenyl derivative (68% yield). Hydrolysis in methanolic KOH followed by acidification yields the bexarotene compound (93% yield). &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Bexarotene displays a number of highly favorable characteristics. It is orally active, shows simple pharmacokinetics without induced metabolism and yields molar concentrations of drug up to 10-fold higher than is achieved with other retinoids [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="346910"&gt;346910&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386796"&gt;386796&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The drug is generally better tolerated than other retinoid drugs. The agent is highly active against several cancers, as well as acting as an insulin potentiator, and a treatment for both psoriasis and hypertriglyceridemia.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Bexarotene activates the entire RXR class of receptors. Transactivation studies showed the EC50 for RXRalpha, RXRbeta and RXRgamma to be 33 +/- 2, 24 +/- 4 and 25 +/- nM, respectively. The corresponding EC50 for the RAR class all exceeded 10 microM. The respective Kd for each of the three isoforms was 14 +/- 3, 21+/- 4 and 29 +/- 7 nM, and for the corresponding RAR receptors, all exceeded 1 microM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="192438"&gt;192438&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a number of preclinical studies, bexarotene showed activities in inducing apoptosis, differentiation or growth arrest of a variety of tumor cell lines. In a comparative study of the effect of a number of RAR- and RXR-selective retinoids on differentiation of leukemia cells, Kizaki et al found that bexarotene produced differentiation and inhibited proliferation of HL-60 cells and cells from leukemia patient in vitro [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="233299"&gt;233299&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This occurred in spite of the fact that the major determinant of differentiation of promyelocytic cells is hRARalpha [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386798"&gt;386798&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Because another retinoid that showed strong inhibition of AP-1 failed to show the same effects as bexarotene, the authors concluded that the agent did not act by inhibiting AP-1. Moreover, bexarotene exerted a synergistic effect with all-trans-retinoic acid in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells. The authors concluded that the RAR/RXR plays a major role in inducing differentiation of these cells and indicates that targeting this pathway for the discovery of antileukemics might prove fruitful. In another study on the cooperative differentiation of myelomonocytic leukemia cells by vitamin D and retinoids, optimal differentiation required activation of both the RAR and the RXR systems [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="305043"&gt;305043&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Bexarotene cooperated efficiently with vitamin D. Phosphorylation of RXRalpha by MAP kinase resulted in a loss of the growth-inhibitory response of cancer cells to vitamin D [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386799"&gt;386799&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Bexarotene also demonstrated a strong activity in vitro in inhibiting squamous differentiation of human bronchial epithelial cells, as did 9-cis-retinoic acid, also an RXR ligand, and a highly selective RAR ligand [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386784"&gt;386784&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These retinoids inhibited the mRNA expression of the squamous differentiation markers, transglutaminase type I, involucrin, keratin 5, and keratin 13, suggesting that inhibition of squamous differentiation of human bronchial epithelial cells could be mediated by activation of either RAR or RXR signaling pathways. These retinoids also markedly reduced AP-1 transcriptional activity and a concomitant, but proportionally smaller, reduction of AP-1 binding to DNA was observed. Treatment of squamous human bronchial epithelial cells with the retinoid, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="21675"&gt;SR-11238&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20234"&gt;SRI International&lt;/ulink&gt;), which inhibited AP-1 without activating retinoid receptor transcriptional properties, reduced the expression of transglutaminase type I and involucrin. These findings support the hypothesis that RAR and RXR signaling pathways inhibit AP-1 transcriptional activity in human bronchial epithelial cells and this contributes to retinoid-induced reversal of squamous differentiation of human bronchial epithelial cells. The investigators did not report on any synergy between RAR- and RXR-targeted ligands. That the RXR system plays a generally important role in differentiation was suggested by studies showing that RAC65 cells, which comprise a subline of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells that cannot be induced to differentiate into neurons by all-trans-retinoic acid (as can the parental line), nonetheless responded to the RXR-selective ligand, bexarotene [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="233303"&gt;233303&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, other investigators report that neuroblastoma cells were refractory to the effect of bexarotene in induction of differentiation or growth arrest [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386801"&gt;386801&lt;/ulink&gt;], or demonstrated a higher differentiation and apoptotic response to 9-cis-retinoic acid than to bexarotene [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386804"&gt;386804&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a preclinical study of the role of hRARalpha in retinoid treatment of human breast cancer in relation to estrogen receptor status, RXR compounds markedly increased the growth-inhibitory activity of RAR ligands, despite the fact that they inhibited growth of the RARalpha-positive cell lines weakly [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="378284"&gt;378284&lt;/ulink&gt;]. RXR compounds also potentiated the action of the anti-estrogen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors that are RARalpha-positive may be candidates for retinoid therapy. Additionally, combinations of RXR ligands with RAR ligands (especially RARalpha agonists) and/or anti-estrogens may have utility in the treatment of breast cancer.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The drug demonstrated some remarkable activities in animal model studies. The agent demonstrated a powerful chemopreventive efficacy toward N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU)-induced rat mammary carcinoma, reducing tumor burden and incidence by 90% in comparison to vehicle-treated animals [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="233296"&gt;233296&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a model of established NMU-induced rat mammary carcinoma, 72% of animals showed complete remission of tumors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="346901"&gt;346901&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Histopathological analysis showed a reduction of bexarotene-treated tumor malignancy, an increase in differentiation, and a sharp decrease in cellular proliferation compared to vehicle-treated control tumors. The response to tamoxifen and bexarotene was enhanced over that of either agent alone. In a model of tamoxifen-resistant rat mammary cancer, in which bexarotene was added to tamoxifen therapy for 20 weeks, an overall response of 94% was observed compared to 33% in rats treated with tamoxifen alone [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386807"&gt;386807&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Even after withdrawal of tamoxifen, the resistant tumors showed a 51% response to 6 weeks of bexarotene treatment alone. Similar studies showed bexarotene to be active against breast cancer in vitro as well as in vivo [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386809"&gt;386809&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Bexarotene also exhibited useful activities other than as an antitumor agent, most notably as an insulin sensitizer for non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="246183"&gt;246183&lt;/ulink&gt;]. RXR-selective ligands (referred to as rexinoids) function as RXR heterodimer-selective agonists, activating RXR: PPARgamma (peroxisome proliferator activated receptors) and RXR:LXR (liver X receptor; an orphan receptor) dimers but not RXR:RAR or RXR:TR (thyroid receptor) heterodimers. Because PPARgamma is a target for antidiabetic agents, the authors investigated whether RXR ligands could alter insulin and glucose signaling. In mouse models of NIDDM and obesity, RXR agonists function as insulin sensitizers and can decrease hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia. This antidiabetic activity can be further enhanced by combination treatment with PPARgamma agonists. These data suggest that the RXR:PPARgamma heterodimer is a single-function complex serving as a molecular target for treatment of insulin resistance. Activation of the RXR:PPARgamma dimer with rexinoids may provide a new and effective treatment for this form of diabetes. Additionally, bexarotene also activates the PPARalpha/RXR signal transduction pathway, leading to reduction of triglycerides and elevation of high density lipoproteins (HDL) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386811"&gt;386811&lt;/ulink&gt;]. When used in combination with fibrates such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="12922"&gt;gemfibrozil&lt;/ulink&gt; (Lopid, CI-719; &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18767"&gt;Pfizer Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;) in hypertriglyceridemic db/db mice, an even more dramatic effect was seen. These data suggest rexinoids may have value, either alone or in conjunction with fibrates, as a new therapeutic approach for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;Using a trideuterated 13C-analog of bexarotene, metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="378285"&gt;378285&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A variety of glucuronide and taurine conjugates of the parent compound and hydroxy-, 6,7-dihydroxy- and oxo-derivatives of bexarotene were observed. Pharmacodynamic studies had indicated that the metabolism of bexarotene was not altered by dose through induction of enzymes [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="346910"&gt;346910&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Rexinoids also affect metabolic enzymes active in metabolism of other compounds. RXR-selective compounds increased hepatic cytochrome P450, while RAR-selective compounds had the opposite effect [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="309187"&gt;309187&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The rexinoids induced CYP2B1/2 and CYP3A, while RAR-selective agents decreased CYP3A and did not affect CYP2B1/2. Both classes of agents decreased CYP1A2 and CYP4A. While the mechanisms for these alterations are not known, the possibility for drug-drug interactions is strongly indicated.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;Several in vitro studies elucidated the molecular bases for some of the toxicities observed with bexarotene in clinical trials. Retinoids, including 'rexinoids' such as bexarotene, often produce alterations in lipid metabolism. In cell culture models, ApoA-I synthesis increased slowly following treatment with either a broad-spectrum retinoid such as all-trans-retinoic acid or with RAR or RAR-selective agonists due to a slow increase in ApoA-I gene transcription [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386813"&gt;386813&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The authors suggested that the response of increased RARalpha, RARbeta and RXRalpha indicated their involvement. However, bexarotene failed to inhibit lipoprotein apo(a) synthesis, in contrast to all-trans retinoic acid and RAR-selective compounds [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386814"&gt;386814&lt;/ulink&gt;], by a mechanism that the authors hypothesized to be post-translational. Nevertheless, apo CIII message was upregulated by bexarotene and the gene was shown to have an RXR-responsive element [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="378389"&gt;378389&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Because this lipoprotein inhibits triglyceride catabolism, the authors suggested this mechanism underlay the commonly observed disturbances in triglyceride metabolism experienced during retinoid therapy. In a clinical trial of high-dose bexarotene for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, thyroid function tests showed suppression of thyrotropin secretion [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="378368"&gt;378368&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The symptoms could be alleviated by thyroxine therapy. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Abnormal clotting function is often seen with retinoid therapy, including bexarotene. In primary human hepatocytes or HepG2 cells, fibrinogen secretion was stimulated up to 2-fold when cells were incubated in the presence of as little as 1 nM all-trans-retinoic acid for 24 h, due to transcriptional upregulation of the fibrinogen gene [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386815"&gt;386815&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Bexarotene, as well as 9-cis retinoic acid, a natural RXR ligand, but not an RARalpha-selective agonist, produced the same effect on fibrinogen synthesis in vitro at lower concentrations. This suggests alterations in fibrinogen are a response intrinsic to rexinoids. Incubation of HepG2 cells with RXR agonist in combination with RARalpha agonist resulted in a further increase in fibrinogen production. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The potential for teratogenicity was suggested by the finding that RXRs liganded with bexarotene could activate several embryonic genes of the HOX family, notably Hoxb-1, Hoxb-6, Hoxb-8 and otx-2 genes [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="378400"&gt;378400&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Activation was most effective in the presence of ligand-bound RAR and RXR receptors.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I/II&lt;/subtitle&gt;The initial phase I clinical trial of bexarotene was carried out at the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="22122"&gt;Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center&lt;/ulink&gt; with 52 patients suffering from advanced cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="346910"&gt;346910&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The dose ranged from 5 to 500 mg/m2 for 1 to 41 weeks in a dose-escalation design. Two patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) experienced major antitumor responses. A later phase I clinical trial at the Lombardi Cancer Center at &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="22821"&gt;Georgetown University&lt;/ulink&gt; administered doses of 5 to 1000 mg/m2 po to 60 patients with advanced cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386796"&gt;386796&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although no objective tumor responses were observed, tumor progression may have been substantially arrested or delayed in non-small cell lung cancer (5 out of 16) and in head and neck cancer (1 out of 5), as well as other tumor types. The investigators recommended a dose of 500 mg/m2 as being appropriate for further clinical trials. In a clinical trial of bexarotene for melanoma carried out at the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="23382"&gt;MD Anderson Cancer Center&lt;/ulink&gt; in 19 patients with melanoma, no efficacy was seen at levels sufficiently high to produce changes in thyroxine and serum triglycerides [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386812"&gt;386812&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The effect on thyroxine has been reported by other investigators [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="378363"&gt;378363&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A dose-escalating phase I/II clinical trial of the topical gel for CTCL has also been reported [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386816"&gt;386816&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this trial, 42/67 patients (63%) responded to treatment (50% improvement in clinical signs by physicians' global assessment) for at least a 4-week duration. 14 Patients (21%) had clinically complete clearing. Mean grades of clinical signs of all patients' CTCL index lesions improved during the initial 24 weeks of treatment for erythema (41%), plaque elevation (74%), scaling (73%), and pruritus (33%). The median time to response was 20 weeks (range 4 to 86 weeks). The mean duration of therapy was 315 days and treatment of the longest treated patient is ongoing at 4.25 years. Responses were durable with a Kaplan-Meier-projected median duration of response of 428 days (14 months) or, at minimum, 2 months in duration (range 57 to 428 days). 58 Patients (87%) reached the 1% gel treatment level indicating good topical tolerance.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II/III&lt;/subtitle&gt;Data from two multicenter, open-label, phase II/III trials, reported at the 2000 American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, demonstrated considerable efficacy for the drug against refractory or persistent CTCL (TNM stage I to IIA or IIB to IVB). Three patients displayed a complete clinical response (CCR) at 300 mg/m2/day (stages IB, IIA and III), while nine patients displayed a CCR at &amp;gt; 300 mg/m2/day (IA-3, IB-1, IIA-1, IIB-4). Kaplan-Meier-projected median durability of response was 176 days (range 29 to 176 days) for 300 mg/m2/day and 306 days (range 55 to 453 days) for &amp;gt; 300 mg/m2/day. Overall, response rates of 47.6% (300 mg/m2/day) and 58.5% (&gt;300 mg/m2/day) were observed [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="368053"&gt;368053&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Interim analysis of a multicenter phase II clinical trial of systemic bexarotene for moderate to severe plaque-forming psoriasis demonstrated efficacy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386847"&gt;386847&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;Retinoids display a characteristic pattern of associated toxicities that appear at the highest doses. These include teratogenicity, hepatotoxicity, dermatotoxicity, headache, thyroid suppression, leukopenia, abnormal clotting, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia and gastrointestinal disturbances, most of which are generally mild. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Several phase I trials showed that bexarotene was substantially less toxic than the broad-spectrum retinoids or RAR-selective agents [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="346910"&gt;346910&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386796"&gt;386796&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386812"&gt;386812&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In these trials, the common retinoid toxicities did not emerge, although abnormal liver-function tests were the most common dose-limiting adverse effect. Leukopenia, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercalcemia also were observed but less commonly [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="346910"&gt;346910&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at doses up to 500 mg/m2. At the higher concentrations of bexarotene, the molar concentration of drug was as much as 10-fold higher than seen with other retinoids, yet with minimal toxicity [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="346910"&gt;346910&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386796"&gt;386796&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At 650 mg/m2, toxicities included skin desquamation, hyperbilirubinemia, transaminase elevation, leukopenia and diarrhea together with asymptomatic dose-related alterations in lipid and thyroid metabolism [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="386796"&gt;386796&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In two phase II/III trials, serious adverse events (at least possibly related to bexarotene treatment) occurred in 3/84 patients (4%) at 300 mg/m2/day (pancreatitis, hemorrhage, liver failure, bilirubinemia, coagulation disorder, neuropathy, pruritus) and at &amp;gt; 300 mg/m2/day, in 6/53 patients (11%) (fever, chest pain, diarrhea, cholestasis, pancreatitis, dehydration, Herpes zoster) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="368053"&gt;368053&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Bexarotene is an example of a second-generation retinoid derivative targeted toward a specific subset of receptors/transcription factors. As such, it represents an improvement over the broader spectrum first-generation drugs. The drug displays several clear advantages over other retinoid receptor ligands. The therapeutic ratio is higher than with other retinoids, and the achievable concentrations are higher as well, probably because its metabolism is independent of dose. Although it is assumed that its mode of action depends upon the drug's receptor specificity, it is not clear that the pro-apoptotic activity, which is receptor-independent, is not the more important factor. The drug clearly has some strong anticancer effects but, just as clearly, it is a limited answer at best. Only a limited set of cancers, most notably CTCL and perhaps a subset of breast cancers, seem to respond well. However, those that do respond appear to show a strong response. Remissions seem to be long-lived, but recurrences do occur, thus indicating that cancers also manage to evade this drug, as is the case with chemotherapy in general. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Two oncological applications seem to offer considerable potential. The most exciting is the potential for chemoprevention. This agent seems to display a powerful chemopreventive activity in some very limited cases. If this activity could be combined with more effective detection of individuals at risk, the potential for cancer control is large. The second application that is just being explored is bexarotene's use in conjunction with other agents. Its unique mechanisms of action are likely to complement other agents. However, its use as a treatment for diabetes seems unlikely, given that agents with higher efficacy already are in the laboratory. The hypertriglyceridemia market is likely to be small, and the use in treating psoriasis competes with a number of similar agents. Nonetheless, this should prove to be a useful drug in a limited number of applications and should be financially rewarding for Ligand until third-generation agents replace it.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Dr Vijai N Nigam, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;12 September 1997&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Targretin (LDG-1069, ALRT-1069), 4-(1-(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2 naphthyl,ethenyl)benzoic acid, is a specific, retinoid X receptor. Retinoids exert their biological effects on cell growth and differentiation by activation of nuclear retinoid receptors (RAR and/or RXR). The chemical synthesis of Targretin and its analogous retinoids, involves three main steps: Friedel-Crafts condensation, olefination and saponification. A large number of retinoids have been synthesized and tested for their biological activity (apoptose (PCD) and transglutamase assay (TGase)) and ability to activate RAR and RXR receptors, using cotransfection and competitive binding assays. The most potent and selective of the analogs is 6-(1-(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8- tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)cyclopropyl)nicotinic acid (LG-100268, &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="14042"&gt;Allergan&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="191009"&gt;191009&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The selectivity for the RXR receptor is associated with substitution at the three position of tetrahydronaphthalene, with either methyl-, chloro-, bromo- or ethyl- groups. Studies indicate that PCD and TGase activities may be dependent on RXR-mediated pathways. RAR requires heterodimerization with RXR, whereas RXR form homodimers. Both RAR/RXR and RXR/RAR are activated by Targretin.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Targretin is used both topically and orally. The oral administration has been tested in micronized and non-micronized formulations in cancer patients. The oral doses used have varied from 5 - 800 mg/m2. Plasma Targretin concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner. In cell lines, the IC50 was exceeded at doses above 140 mg/m2. Since Targretin did not induce its own metabolism, it can be administered chronically at therapeutic doses [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206215"&gt;206215&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Doses as high as 400 mg/m2/day have been tested. Rash and low grade leukopenia have been reported only at high doses, however, common retinoid-induced toxicities, such as headache, arthralgias and mucocutaneous toxicities were not observed with Targretin.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In common with other RXR specific retinoids, Targretin induced the expression of the HDL protein, apolipoprotein A-II (apo A-II) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="233297"&gt;233297&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The effect was mediated at the transcription level on the J site of the apo A-II promoter. Retinoids also induced fibrinogen production both in vitro and in vivo [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="233304"&gt;233304&lt;/ulink&gt;]. HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes were used in vitro.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At doses as high as 650 mg/m2/day, skin desquamation and blood clotting disturbance (elevation of prothrombin time) occurred with Targretin [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206215"&gt;206215&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, Targretin did not adversely affect total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Indeed, preclinical data demonstrated that Targretin significantly decreased blood glucose, triglyceride and insulin levels in a mouse model of human type II diabetes and of human obesity (mouse ob/ob model).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Targretin induced apoptosis in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60) and the human cervical squamous cell line (ME-180) and induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in human myeloma cell line (RPM 18226), Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), breast cancer, prostate cancer and squamous cell carcinoma derived cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="191009"&gt;191009&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Targretin reduced breast cancer induced by nitrosomethyl urea in rats. It was more effective than Tamoxifen. The number of tumors/animal was also reduced. No dose-limiting toxicities were noted in the animals.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I/II&lt;/subtitle&gt;Phase I studies have shown that Targretin oral capsules are well tolerated over a very broad dose range, and up to 1000 mg/m2/day in advanced cancer patients. Two studies were carried out; one at George Town Cancer Center and the other at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in order to investigate toxicological effects, metabolism and the efficacy of oral Targretin in cancer patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="177824"&gt;177824&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206215"&gt;206215&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients having non- small cell lung carcinoma, head and neck cancer, cutaneous T-cell leukemia and other cancers were the subjects. No dose-limiting toxicity was reported, except grade 1 headache initially. A significant bioavailability was shown in pharmacokinetic studies, but no significant elevations in triglyceride or cholesterol occured and no retinoid related hypercalcemia or liver enzyme elevation was seen. A micronized version of Targretin provided greater bioavailability. There was no evidence of auto-induced metabolism.Characteristic retinoid toxicities, such as mucocutaneous irritation, nausea, vomiting and bone pain, were noted. Blood plasma levels were proportional to the oral dose. Mild improvement or stabilization of the disease was observed in the case of non-small cell lung carcinoma and head and neck cancer.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In phase I and II clinical trials of topical Targretin in cutaneous T-cell leukemia (CTCL), patients with biopsy proven cutaneous CTCL were treated by topical application of Targretin gel to the lesions, one to two times daily. After 14 weeks, most had improvement in the scaling, erythema and plaque elevation of the lesions. The longest duration of the treatment was over ten months. In a significant number of patients, clearing or partial clearing of the lesions was observed. Phase I and II trials of topical Targretin gel therapy, applied to cutaneous KS lesions, was undertaken. Untreated lesions served as controls. Lesions were treated two to four times daily, with a duration of treatment of 12 weeks or more. The criteria for efficacy of treatment, was the flattening of the lesion by 50%. No complete responses were seen, and only 15% had a partial response. However, half of the patients had response in one lesion out of three treated. No dose-limiting, non-dermatological side-effects were noted.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Targretin has yet to find an indication for which it could be ideally targeted. Its property of inducing differentiation as well as the in vitro activity of Targretin, has not been reflected in the control of cancer in vivo. However, the ability of Targretin to induce apoptosis is definitely exploitable and should be explored for slow growing tumors at their early stage, or in combination with agents that limit proliferation. Targretin appears to have some success against CTCL and in stabilizing non-small cell lung carcinoma, but has shown poor results in AIDS associated KS. The criteria used for evaluating Targretin in CTCL and lung cancer, consists of only a reduction in the propensity of the disease and no significant hope of a curative effect is apparent. Hence, more rigorous trials of longer duration need to be planned for these two cancers, in order to arrive at a meaningful conclusion. The fact that Targretin is tolerable and has no serious side-effects suggests that the therapeutic development of Targretin may still be beneficial. The effectiveness of Targretin in type II diabetes and obesity could be hopeful targets for this retinoid analog.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company
