In August 2016, the FDA granted the product Orphan designation for the treatment of MDS [&lt;ulink linkID="1793108" linkType="Reference"&gt;1793108&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;In April 2009, the EMEA's COMP adopted a positive opinion on granting Opsona's humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody to TLR2, presumed to be OPN-305, Orphan status for the prevention of  ischemia/reperfusion injury associated with solid organ transplantation [&lt;ulink linkID="999228" linkType="Reference"&gt;999228&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By April 2013, the EMA had granted the drug Orphan status [&lt;ulink linkID="1412037" linkType="Reference"&gt;1412037&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2017, the COMP recommended granting the drug Orphan designations for treatment of pancreatic cancer and treatment of MDS [&lt;ulink linkID="1897364" linkType="Reference"&gt;1897364&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in February 2017, the Orphan designations were granted [&lt;ulink linkID="1913059" linkType="Reference"&gt;1913059&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Regulatory&gt;</value></Regulatory><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2015, a phase I/II safety/efficacy trial was initiated in patients with second-line lower (low and intermediate-1) risk MDS in the US [&lt;ulink linkID="1628953" linkType="Reference"&gt;1628953&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1635764" linkType="Reference"&gt;1635764&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The prospective, open-label trial (&lt;ulink linkID="222542" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02363491&lt;/ulink&gt;; OPN-305-106) would assess cycles of iv infusions of OPN-305 in patients (estimated n = 40) in the US. In October 2015, the trial was expected to complete in May 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1793114" linkType="Reference"&gt;1793114&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2016, data from the trial were presented at the 58th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in San Diego, CA. After a single iv dose of 5 and 10 mg/kg, OPN-305 maintained the full receptor occupancy for 28 days and the full receptor occupancy was noted at trough (pre-dose) upon repeat iv dosing q4w without an evidence of treatment-related anti-drug antibodies. At 10 versus 5 mg/kg, the mean dose-normalized exposure of OPN-305 was greater and it was likely to reflect faster clearance at lower concentration. In three, five, four, two, three and five patients, responses including major hematologic improvement, minor hematologic improvement, stable disease, no response, progressive disease, and too early to detect were observed [&lt;ulink linkID="1881402" linkType="Reference"&gt;1881402&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1877422" linkType="Reference"&gt;1877422&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2016, the trial was expected to complete in June 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1793114" linkType="Reference"&gt;1793114&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2017, the overall response rate was 52%. Of 31 patients evaluated, there were 5 complete, 8 partial and 9 stable responses [&lt;ulink linkID="1989575" linkType="Reference"&gt;1989575&lt;/ulink&gt;].   In June 2017, further clinical data were presented at the 22nd EHA Annual Congress in Madrid, Spain. Treatment with OPN-305 showed an excellent safety and tolerability profile and a dose effect was demonstrated with 26.7% evaluable patients showing a major response in terms of transfusion independence at 10 mg/kg, and at 5 mg/kg, 20% of patients showed a major response in terms of transfusion independence [&lt;ulink linkID="1939504" linkType="Reference"&gt;1939504&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2018, Opsona noted that 44 patients had been treated. At that time, the dose-expansion phase of the trial had been initiated, and at the recommended dose of 10mg/kg, overall response and complete response rates of 40 and 16% were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="2011358" linkType="Reference"&gt;2011358&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2018, further data were presented at the 60th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in San Diego, CA. Across multiple centers, six met the primary endpoint, five of which were on tomaralimab monotherapy at the time of response even though patients were very heavily pre-treated with previous therapies. No dose limiting toxicities or development of anti-drug antibodies [&lt;ulink linkID="2098868" linkType="Reference"&gt;2098868&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2014, it was reported at the 15th Informa Phase I &amp;amp; IIa Clinical Trials Meeting in London, UK, that clinical studies in cancer would begin that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1530076" linkType="Reference"&gt;1530076&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2011, a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial for the prevention of delayed renal graft function was planned for 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1205538" linkType="Reference"&gt;1205538&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2012, a three-part, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, sequential adaptive, phase II study (&lt;ulink linkID="111705" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01794663&lt;/ulink&gt;; OPN305-102, 2012-001455-39) to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of OPN-305 was initiated in renal transplant patients (expected n = 278) at high risk of delayed graft function (DGF). At that time, the trial was expected to complete in April 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1386343" linkType="Reference"&gt;1386343&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2014, the proof-of-concept trial planned to enroll 270 patients in 50 medical centers in the US and Europe. At that time, a larger phase III trial was expected to be conducted following the favorable results from the phase II trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1593171" linkType="Reference"&gt;1593171&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2015, the company  initiated  part B of the trial in extended criteria donors (ECD) renal transplant recipients. At that time, data from the part A of the trial were reported. Data demonstrated that OPN-305 was well tolerated and safe [&lt;ulink linkID="1637949" linkType="Reference"&gt;1637949&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2016, the trial was no longer recruiting (n = 351) and was expected to complete in June 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1386343" linkType="Reference"&gt;1386343&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2011, at NextLevel Pharma's Second Annual Meeting on Advancing Biologics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, it was reported that humanization and manufacturing of OPN-305 were completed and a phase I trial in healthy volunteers and a phase II trial in renal transplant patients were planned for  later that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1165004" linkType="Reference"&gt;1165004&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2011, a single center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential, dose-escalating phase I study was initiated. The trial would evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of  single iv doses of OPN-305 in healthy volunteers [&lt;ulink linkID="1205538" linkType="Reference"&gt;1205538&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2011, at the Annual One-Day Meeting on Medicinal Chemistry of SRC and KVCV in Ghent, Belgium, it was reported that no adverse effects were observed in a clinical toxicology trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1245623" linkType="Reference"&gt;1245623&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer model, tomaralimab significantly inhibited tumor delayed the regrowth of tumors through a decrease in intra-tumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increase of intratumor macrophages [&lt;ulink linkID="2094804" linkType="Reference"&gt;2094804&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2018, Opsona reported that the drug was being evaluated preclinically in ovarian cancer and melanoma [&lt;ulink linkID="2011358" linkType="Reference"&gt;2011358&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By April 2013, the antibody had demonstrated activity in preclinical animal models and ex-vivo studies  [&lt;ulink linkID="1412037" linkType="Reference"&gt;1412037&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2012, preclinical data were presented at Bio-Europe Spring 2012 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. OPN-305 resulted in  a 40% improvement in infarct size in a porcine model of myocardial infarction. Further data reported that preclinical exploratory studies were ongoing for OPN-305 for pancreatic, gastric, lung and lymphoid cancers  [&lt;ulink linkID="1273508" linkType="Reference"&gt;1273508&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2011, preclinical data were presented at the Annual One-Day Meeting on Medicinal Chemistry of SRC and KVCV in Ghent, Belgium. OPN-301 (25 mg/kg), administered 25 min after ischemia, reduced infarct size and preserved cardiac function in an ischemia/reperfusion injury model in vivo. It also showed positive effects in a renal transplantation model, when administered 1 h before surgery [&lt;ulink linkID="1245623" linkType="Reference"&gt;1245623&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2009, preclinical data were presented for OPN-301 at the Ninth World Congress on Inflammation in Tokyo, Japan.  In THP1 cells it specifically inhibited TLR2-mediated NFkB activation. The activity of the antibody was shown to be dependent on Fcgamma receptors CD32a and CD32b. Chimeric antibodies or F(ab)'2 fragments purified from OPN-301 were devoid of Fcgamma receptor dependency but were as functionally active as OPN-301 in blocking TLR2 activity. CD32a/b was required by OPN-301 for activity at TLR2; the chimeric versions (hIgG1 or hIgG4) blocked TLR2 independently of CD32a/b [&lt;ulink linkID="1020258" linkType="Reference"&gt;1020258&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By January 2009, preliminary research had indicated that OPN-305 was a potent inhibitor of TLR-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and positive data had been observed in  disease models, including sepsis, cardiac and kidney ischemia/reperfusion injuries   [&lt;ulink linkID="979361" linkType="Reference"&gt;979361&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Preclinical&gt;</value></Preclinical><AdditionalInformation><displayLabel>Additional Information</displayLabel><value>&lt;AdditionalInformation&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2009, Opsona entered into an agreement for &lt;ulink linkID="22690" linkType="Company"&gt;Lonza&lt;/ulink&gt; to manufacture the antibody for preclinical and clinical studies using its GS Gene Expression System [&lt;ulink linkID="991578" linkType="Reference"&gt;991578&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2009, &lt;ulink linkID="1021230" linkType="Company"&gt;Antitope&lt;/ulink&gt; concluded an agreement with Opsona to apply its composite human antibody technology to generate a therapeutic antibody.
