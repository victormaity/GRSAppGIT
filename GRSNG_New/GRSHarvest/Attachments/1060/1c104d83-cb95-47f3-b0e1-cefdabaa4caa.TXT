[&lt;ulink linkID="2087714" linkType="Reference"&gt;2087714&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In the US, the product is indicated for    the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="2024764" linkType="Reference"&gt;2024764&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2018, fostamatinib was launched in the US for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with ITP [&lt;ulink linkID="2038065" linkType="Reference"&gt;2038065&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2018, the EMA validated and accepted a MAA filing for the treatment of adult ITP [&lt;ulink linkID="2081579" linkType="Reference"&gt;2081579&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in January 2019, European approval was expected by the end of 2019 with launch  anticipated in 2020 [&lt;ulink linkID="2113201" linkType="Reference"&gt;2113201&lt;/ulink&gt;]; later that month, the EMA's CHMP recommended a scientific discussion together with a list of questions [&lt;ulink linkID="2140441" linkType="Reference"&gt;2140441&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2018, Kissei planned clinical studies and to seek approval in Japan for ITP  [&lt;ulink linkID="2087714" linkType="Reference"&gt;2087714&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2019, Kissei planned to meet Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in early 2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="2108577" linkType="Reference"&gt;2108577&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Development is also ongoing for IgA nephropathy and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). In April 2019, a phase III study was initiated in patients  with warm AIHA [&lt;ulink linkID="2152670" linkType="Reference"&gt;2152670&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2152304" linkType="Reference"&gt;2152304&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in May  2019, topline  results were expected in  early 2021 [&lt;ulink linkID="2148917" linkType="Reference"&gt;2148917&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2014, a phase II trial for IgA nephropathy was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="1626947" linkType="Reference"&gt;1626947&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in April 2018,     the company reported negative topline data  [&lt;ulink linkID="2018919" linkType="Reference"&gt;2018919&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in June 2018, the study was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1626947" linkType="Reference"&gt;1626947&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2018, the company planned to meet  the FDA   regarding approval in   AIHA  [&lt;ulink linkID="1994989" linkType="Reference"&gt;1994989&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Rigel was previously investigating the drug for the potential treatment of atherosclerosis [&lt;ulink linkID="1144331" linkType="Reference"&gt;1144331&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, no further development has been reported for this indication since December 2010. Rigel was also previously developing the drug for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and  B-cell and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) [&lt;ulink linkID="750693" linkType="Reference"&gt;750693&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="782440" linkType="Reference"&gt;782440&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="991547" linkType="Reference"&gt;991547&lt;/ulink&gt;].   In September 2010, the OSKIRA phase III RA program, which would consist of three pivotal studies to be followed by long-term safety trials, was initiated. A long-term open-label extension study was also transferred from Rigel to &lt;ulink linkID="14190" linkType="Company"&gt;AstraZeneca&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkID="1135007" linkType="Reference"&gt;1135007&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1135062" linkType="Reference"&gt;1135062&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2013, regulatory filings for fostamatinib use in combination with a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) were to be filed in Q413 [&lt;ulink linkID="1406722" linkType="Reference"&gt;1406722&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2013, topline data from the OSKIRA-1 study were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="1399844" linkType="Reference"&gt;1399844&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in June 2013, data were reported from OSKIRA-2 and OSKIRA-3  [&lt;ulink linkID="1432799" linkType="Reference"&gt;1432799&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1432640" linkType="Reference"&gt;1432640&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2011, an IND was filed in China, presumed to be for   the treatment of RA; in October 2012, supplemental materials were required by the SFDA to conclude the review [&lt;ulink linkID="1337701" linkType="Reference"&gt;1337701&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1345196" linkType="Reference"&gt;1345196&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By April 2007, a phase II trial for B-cell lymphoma had started [&lt;ulink linkID="782440" linkType="Reference"&gt;782440&lt;/ulink&gt;]; the trial was completed in October 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1192630" linkType="Reference"&gt;1192630&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2011, a phase II trial in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was initiated  and at that time the trial was expected to be completed in December 2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1440794" linkType="Reference"&gt;1440794&lt;/ulink&gt;];  in December 2014, clinical data were presented [&lt;ulink linkID="1617756" linkType="Reference"&gt;1617756&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2010,  a phase II trial    for PTCL was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1192638" linkType="Reference"&gt;1192638&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However in September 2013, the company discontinued development for RA and lymphoma due to insufficient efficacy data and the competitive market for those indications [&lt;ulink linkID="1474036" linkType="Reference"&gt;1474036&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2009, a phase II, NCI-conducted trial was underway for solid tumors  [&lt;ulink linkID="1014441" linkType="Reference"&gt;1014441&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in April 2013, negative results were published  [&lt;ulink linkID="1429678" linkType="Reference"&gt;1429678&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no development has been reported since that time. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Fostamatinib was previously under investigation for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), for which preclinical data were reported in December 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="641305" linkType="Reference"&gt;641305&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, in April 2008, the indication was no longer listed on the company's pipeline [&lt;ulink linkID="894383" linkType="Reference"&gt;894383&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The agent was also being investigated for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [&lt;ulink linkID="777374" linkType="Reference"&gt;777374&lt;/ulink&gt;], but in November 2008, development was delayed until a partner had been found [&lt;ulink linkID="958462" linkType="Reference"&gt;958462&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in January 2009, the indication was not listed on its pipeline [&lt;ulink linkID="976459" linkType="Reference"&gt;976459&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;R-406 was selected as the lead from a series of Syk kinase inhibitors in January 2004, and in November 2005, data from a phase I trial were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="520320" linkType="Reference"&gt;520320&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="637146" linkType="Reference"&gt;637146&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, in April 2008, R-406 was not listed on the company's pipeline and it was presumed that development of R-406 had been discontinued in favor of its prodrug, fostamatinib [&lt;ulink linkID="894383" linkType="Reference"&gt;894383&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;AstraZeneca was developing the drug under license from Rigel. However, in June 2013, the company returned all rights to the drug following phase III data that 'did not measure up to the results seen earlier in development' [&lt;ulink linkID="1432799" linkType="Reference"&gt;1432799&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1432640" linkType="Reference"&gt;1432640&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><PatentsAndGenerics><displayLabel>Patents and Generics</displayLabel><value>&lt;PatentsAndGenerics&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2017, Rigel noted that fostamatinib was covered in the US by a composition of matter with expiry in September 2026 and by a broader patent with composition of matter claims with expiry in March 2026. Three patents for methods of using fostamatinib to treat various indications, methods of making fostamatinib and compositions of matter covering certain intermediates had also been granted and would expire between April 2023 and June 2026. At that time, corresponding applications had been filed in foreign jurisdictions, and a patent covering composition of matter and compositions for use treating various diseases had been granted by the EPO [&lt;ulink linkID="1910903" linkType="Reference"&gt;1910903&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in March 2018, this was still the case [&lt;ulink linkID="2011332" linkType="Reference"&gt;2011332&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/PatentsAndGenerics&gt;</value></PatentsAndGenerics><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;In January 2018, the company planned to meet  the FDA   regarding approval in   AIHA  [&lt;ulink linkID="1994989" linkType="Reference"&gt;1994989&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2017, an NDA was filed in the US for the treatment of chronic and persistent ITP supported by data from  the 047, 048 and 049 studies [&lt;ulink linkID="1918332" linkType="Reference"&gt;1918332&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in June 2017, the FDA accepted the NDA for review, and a PDUFA date was scheduled for April 17, 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1938683" linkType="Reference"&gt;1938683&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Patients received fostamatinib (100 mg bid), fostamatinib (100 mg bid uptitrated to 150 mg qd after 4 weeks) and placebo followed by fostamatinib (100 mg bid after 24 weeks) in arms 1 (n = 310), 2 (n = 304) and 3 (n = 304), respectively. At week 24, the proportion of patients achieving ACR20 (co-primary endpoint) was significantly greater in arms 1 (49.0%) and 2 (44.4%) versus arm 3 (34.2%). The change in mTSS at week 24 (co-primary endpoint) was 0.45, 1.29 and 0.13 in arms 1, 2 and 3, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1494105" linkType="Reference"&gt;1494105&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2010, the phase III OSKIRA program was initiated. Two 12-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies (&lt;ulink linkID="70219" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01197521&lt;/ulink&gt;; OSKIRA-1 and &lt;ulink linkID="70218" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01197534&lt;/ulink&gt;; OSKIRA-2) were to enroll patients who responded inadequately to DMARDS, including methotrexate. A 6-month, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial (&lt;ulink linkID="70209" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01197755&lt;/ulink&gt;; OSKIRA-3) was to treat subjects who responded inadequately to anti-TNF therapy. In each trial, 100 mg bid and 100 mg bid for 4 weeks followed by a 150 mg maintenance dose qd would be assessed. The primary outcome measure for each study would be ACR20 response at 6 months. One of the 12-month studies would also assess the change in structural progression at 6 months. Following the trials, long-term safety extension studies would be conducted and would recruit over 2000 patients treated during phase II and III trials [&lt;ulink linkID="1135007" linkType="Reference"&gt;1135007&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2011,  enrollment of patients (approximately n = 900) in the placebo-controlled, OSKIRA-1 study had been  completed   [&lt;ulink linkID="1252657" linkType="Reference"&gt;1252657&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2013, a long-term extension study (OSKIRA-X) was underway [&lt;ulink linkID="1353921" linkType="Reference"&gt;1353921&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2013, topline data from the 923-patient, OSKIRA-1 study were reported. At 24 weeks, the ACR20 response rate was significantly improved in both fostamatinib 100 mg bid (49%) and 100 mg bid for 4 weeks followed by a 150 mg maintenance dose qd (44%), compared with placebo (34%). However, both dosing regimens did not demonstrate significant difference in modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) compared with placebo at 24 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="1399844" linkType="Reference"&gt;1399844&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2013, data were reported from OSKIRA-2 and OSKIRA-3. In OSKIRA-2, the ACR20 response rate at 24 weeks was 39.6% for fostamatinib (100 mg bid or 100 mg bid for 4 weeks followed by a 150 mg maintenance dose qd) compared with 24.5% for placebo. In OSKIRA-3, the ACR20 response rate at 24 weeks was 36.2% for fostamatinib (100 mg bid) compared with 21.1% for placebo. The response rate with fostamatinib 100 mg bid for 4 weeks followed by a 150 mg maintenance dose qd (27.8%)  was not significantly different compared with placebo  [&lt;ulink linkID="1432799" linkType="Reference"&gt;1432799&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1432640" linkType="Reference"&gt;1432640&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2013, similar clinical data from the OSKIRA-2 and -3 studies were presented at the 77th ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="1492778" linkType="Reference"&gt;1492778&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1492779" linkType="Reference"&gt;1492779&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1492735" linkType="Reference"&gt;1492735&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2011, an IND was filed in China, presumed to be for   the treatment of RA; in October 2012, supplemental materials were required by the SFDA to conclude the review [&lt;ulink linkID="1337701" linkType="Reference"&gt;1337701&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1345196" linkType="Reference"&gt;1345196&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By August 2011, a phase IIb trial (OSKIRA-4) had been initiated to evaluate fostamatinib as a monotherapy in RA patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1211713" linkType="Reference"&gt;1211713&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2012, topline data were reported. The 6-month study evaluated the efficacy of fostamatinib monotherapy versus &lt;ulink linkID="14163" linkType="Drug"&gt;adalimumab&lt;/ulink&gt; and placebo in patients (n = 280) who had never previously received a DMARD, were DMARD intolerant or had an inadequate response to DMARDs. Patients received fostamatinib (100 mg bid [A], 100 mg bid for a month followed by 150 mg qd [B], and 100 mg bid for a month followed by 100 mg qd [C]). Fostamatinib met the first primary endpoint of statistically significant superior DAS28 score change from baseline compared to placebo at 6 weeks at the A and B dose regimens, but not the C dose. However, the study did not meet the did not meet the second primary endpoint as all fostamatinib monotherapy doses were inferior to adalimumab monotherapy at week 24 based on DAS28 [&lt;ulink linkID="1350166" linkType="Reference"&gt;1350166&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2013, further data were presented from an interventional, randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (&lt;ulink linkID="73269" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01264770&lt;/ulink&gt;; D4300C00004; 2010-023692-26) at the EULAR 2013 Annual Meeting in Madrid, Spain.  At week 6, a statistically significant improvement in disease activity score28-C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP; primary endpoint) was observed in arms A and B with a difference of 0.56 and 0.22, respectively. When compared with adalimumab, treatment with fostamatinib in arms A, B and C was significantly less effective with respective to DAS28-CRP (co-primary endpoint) with the difference of 0.72, -0.61 and -0.72, respectively, at week 24 [&lt;ulink linkID="1448853" linkType="Reference"&gt;1448853&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1441898" linkType="Reference"&gt;1441898&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2008, a phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="38178" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00805467&lt;/ulink&gt;; C-935788-012) was initiated to recruit patients with RA (expected n = 800) who had completed previous Rigel-sponsored trials to investigate the long-term safety of fostamatinib [&lt;ulink linkID="976459" linkType="Reference"&gt;976459&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The study was expected to complete in October 2014. In October 2013, the trial were terminated [&lt;ulink linkID="1192719" linkType="Reference"&gt;1192719&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2008, a second phase IIb 3-month, 195-patient, multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel dose TASKI 3 trial (&lt;ulink linkID="11565" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00665626&lt;/ulink&gt;; C-935788-011) began, which would compare 100 mg of fostamatinib bid with placebo. Patients would have the option to continue methotrexate and/or other therapies. The objective for the study, which would take place in the US, Europe and Latin America, was efficacy determined by ACR 20 scores. Secondary endpoints included ACR 50 and ACR 70 scores, and DAS28 rates, plus safety. The TASKi 3 study would also measure changes in bone morphology using MRI scans. Results were expected in late 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="915976" linkType="Reference"&gt;915976&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2008, the company expected to report results in the third quarter of 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="958462" linkType="Reference"&gt;958462&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2009, enrollment was expected to be completed in April 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="981008" linkType="Reference"&gt;981008&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later in February 2009, results from the trial were expected in August 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="986246" linkType="Reference"&gt;986246&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2009, top-line results were expected in July 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="1006013" linkType="Reference"&gt;1006013&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2009, it was reported that  the 219-patient trial had failed to meet its efficacy endpoints as fostamatinib-treated patients did not achieve significantly higher ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 and DAS28 response rates than patients on placebo. However, placebo response rates were considerably higher than expected. A total of 38, 22, 9 and 12% of drug-recipients achieved ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 and DAS28, respectively, compared with 37, 12, 6 and 10% of placebo-recipients, respectively. MRI assessments  showed improvements in synovitis and osteitis scores in the wrists and hands with fostamatinib compared with  placebo, but there was no significant effect on erosion scores at 3 months. Diarrhea and hypertension were the most common clinically meaningful drug-related adverse events. Events related to infections were the most common overall and were generally evenly distributed among the placebo and fostamatinib group. At 3 months the mean increase in blood pressure was 3.2 to 3.6 mmHg for the 100 mg bid dose group. Blood pressure medication was adjusted or initiated in approximately 17% of patients in the 100 mg bid dose group compared with 8% of the placebo group [&lt;ulink linkID="1028001" linkType="Reference"&gt;1028001&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2008, a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel dose TASKi 2 study (&lt;ulink linkID="11566" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00665925&lt;/ulink&gt;; C-935788-010) began. A total of 420 patients would receive a stable dose of methotrexate plus 100 or 150 mg of fostamatinib bid or placebo for 6 months. The primary objective of the study, which would take place in the US, Europe and Latin America, was efficacy determined by ACR 20 scores. Secondary endpoints included ACR 50 and ACR 70 scores, and DAS28 rates, plus safety [&lt;ulink linkID="915976" linkType="Reference"&gt;915976&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2008, enrollment was expected to complete in by the first quarter of 2009 with results anticipated in the third quarter of 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="958462" linkType="Reference"&gt;958462&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later in November 2008, patient screening for enrollment in TASKi 2 was complete [&lt;ulink linkID="961801" linkType="Reference"&gt;961801&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2009, results from the trial were expected in July 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="986246" linkType="Reference"&gt;986246&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2009, data from the completed trial were reported. In the 100 mg bid and 150 mg qd dose groups, ACR 20, aCR 50, ACR 70 and DAS28 response rates were higher than in the placebo group, with the 100 mg dose group showing greater efficacy. ACR 50 results of 19% in the placebo arm, 32% in the 150 mg dose group and 43% in the 100 mg dose cohort were seen. Effects of fostamatinib were seen within 1 week of therapy and was maintained throughout the study.The drug was well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1024360" linkType="Reference"&gt;1024360&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2010, further reported results for ACR 20 improvement in the 100 mg cohort showed responder rates of 66% versus 35% of the placebo group, and for ACR 70 responder rates were demonstrated in 28% versus 10% of the placebo group. There was also a 31% DAS28 remission shown, versus 7% in the placebo group [&lt;ulink linkID="1075363" linkType="Reference"&gt;1075363&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Data were published in September 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1133609" linkType="Reference"&gt;1133609&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1133654" linkType="Reference"&gt;1133654&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2011, similar clinical data were presented at EULAR 2011 in London, UK [&lt;ulink linkID="1193288" linkType="Reference"&gt;1193288&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2011, further  data were presented at the ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL. A significant improvement in pain, patient's global assessment (PGA) and physical function (PF) was observed in fostamatinib (100 mg bid) group at week 1 compared with placebo and was sustained until week 24. Significantly greater proportion of patients achieved minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for pain, PGA and PF in the fostamatinib (100 mg bid) group compared with the placebo, by week 24. In fostamatinib (100 mg bid) group, a significant improvement in the short form-36 (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS; including, SF-36 physical domain and fatigue) was observed at week 24 compared with placebo, but not for the SF-36 mental component summary. Furthermore, a significant greater proportion of patients in fostamatinib group achieved the SF-36 PCS MCID (72.9%) and a numerically greater percentage of patients for fatigue (59.8%) compared with placebo (57.6 and 48.6%, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkID="1229431" linkType="Reference"&gt;1229431&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2006, a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, ascending-dose, dose-ranging study (TASKi 1, &lt;ulink linkID="2024" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00326339&lt;/ulink&gt;; C-935788-006) began, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of up to three doses of fostamatinib (50, 100 and 150 mg bid) in RA patients (expected enrollment n=180) failing to respond to methotrexate. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR20 response after 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included safety assessments [&lt;ulink linkID="677234" linkType="Reference"&gt;677234&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="688626" linkType="Reference"&gt;688626&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2006, results were reported at the 14th Inflammation Research Association meeting in Cambridge, MD. Raised diastolic blood pressure was seen in three patients at a dose of 10 to 15 microM on days 6 and 7. High doses were also associated with postural dizziness, rapidly reversible reductions in neutrophil counts and CD14 monocytes, and reversible mild elevations of LFTs. An ex vivo basophil activation assay showed that aggranulation was blocked via Syk kinase inhibition, as demonstrated by the fact that CD63 was upregulated on peripheral blood basophils [&lt;ulink linkID="733002" linkType="Reference"&gt;733002&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients were to receive twice-daily doses of either fostamatinib 50 or 100 mg. In April 2007, enrollment in the 50 mg group had been completed. Interim data from the 50 mg cohort showed the drug to be well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="782440" linkType="Reference"&gt;782440&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2007, data from the 189-patient study were reported. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR20 response at week 12 and secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients achieving an ACR50, ACR70 and DAS28 response at week 12. At week 12, ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates of 32, 65 and 72%, 17, 49 and 57% and 2, 33 and 40% were seen in patients who received 50, 100 and 150 mg of fostamatinib, respectively, compared with 38, 19 and 4% in placebo-treated patients. DAS28 response rates of 20, 35 and 47% was also seen in patients who received 50, 100 and 150 mg of fostamatinib, respectively, compared with 17% in placebo-treated patients. In some 100 and 150 mg-treated patients, onset of efficacy occurred one week after the initiation of dosing. Common adverse events included neutropenia, elevations of liver function tests and gastrointestinal side effects [&lt;ulink linkID="860732" linkType="Reference"&gt;860732&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In October 2016, data from the second trial (FIT 2; Study 048) were reported. The stable platelet response for fostamatinib was 18% and consistent with the FIT 1 trial. In Study 048, one patient in the placebo group achieved a stable platelet response, and therefore the difference between subjects on treatment and on placebo did not reach statistical significance and the study did not meet its primary endpoint. However, when data from both studies were combined the difference between those on treatment and on placebo  was statistically significant [&lt;ulink linkID="1865540" linkType="Reference"&gt;1865540&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2016, further results were presented. In the combined dataset for studies 047 and  048, patients who met the primary endpoint had their platelet counts increase from a median of 18,500/microl of blood at baseline to &amp;gt; 100,000/microl at week 24 of treatment. In the combined data sets, the frequency of patients who achieved a stable platelet response was statistically superior in the fostamatinib  versus the placebo group in all subgroup analyses: prior splenectomy or not; prior exposure to TPO agents or not; platelet counts below or above 15,000/microl of blood at baseline, demonstrating that fostamatinib effect was consistent across various clinical and treatment backgrounds.

There were 18 stable platelet responses (primary endpoint); 15 had responses at 5 of 6 clinic visits and 14 at all clinic visits. Of 44 placebo patients who crossed over to the open-label study, 10 had a stable platelet response. In fostamatinib responders, fostamatinib non-responders and placebo patients, frequency of bleeding related serious adverse events were 2, 7 and 10% and need for rescue medication was 16, 40 and 45%, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1988732" linkType="Reference"&gt;1988732&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2018, these data were published. In additional data published from the combined data sets of both trials, 43% of patients on fostamatinib achieved  overall responses (&amp;gt;/= 1 platelet count &amp;gt;/= 50,000/microl within the first 12 weeks on treatment) compared with 14% on placebo (p=0.0006). The median time to response was 15 days (100 mg bid), and 83% responded within 8 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="2029031" linkType="Reference"&gt;2029031&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2029291" linkType="Reference"&gt;2029291&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2013, Rigel planned to conduct a phase III study, which would include 150 patients with ITP. At that time, the study was expected to be completed in 2015 [&lt;ulink linkID="1474036" linkType="Reference"&gt;1474036&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2014, the single group assignment, open-label extension study (&lt;ulink linkID="176115" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02077192&lt;/ulink&gt;; C-935788-049, 2013-005454-30; Study 049) was initiated in the US, to assess the  safety and efficacy of  fostamatinib. At that time, the study was expected to complete in  October 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1645910" linkType="Reference"&gt;1645910&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2016, enrollment was complete  [&lt;ulink linkID="1747967" linkType="Reference"&gt;1747967&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2016, data were reported from 118 patients who completed both the FIT 1 and 2 trials, including 43 placebo non-responders of whom 36 had at least 12 weeks of follow-up; off these patients, 6 patients (17%) achieved a prospectively defined stable platelet response [&lt;ulink linkID="1865540" linkType="Reference"&gt;1865540&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2017, further data from the trial were reported. As of September 2016, 124 patients had been enrolled; responders who enrolled in the study from Study 047/048 had maintained a median platelet count of 106,500/microl over the study period. Additionally, 22% of 41 former placebo patients who had been treated with fostamatinib for a minimum of 12 weeks achieved a stable platelet response [&lt;ulink linkID="1896139" linkType="Reference"&gt;1896139&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2017, clinical data from 123 patients were presented at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in Atlanta, GA. A total of 25 of 27 stable responders received &amp;gt;/= 12 months of therapy; 17 of 25 patients maintained their response, with a median platelet count of 115000/microl. The Kaplan-Meier median duration of stable platelet responses (months; [min, max]) for the 17 pts who maintained stable response had not yet been reached, and was estimated as &amp;gt;28 months. Most commonly reported AEs were diarrhea, hypertension, petechiae and epistaxis [&lt;ulink linkID="1988732" linkType="Reference"&gt;1988732&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2018, the trial was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="2011332" linkType="Reference"&gt;2011332&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2018, further data were presented at the 41st Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in San Antonio, TX. The overall response observed was 44% and remaining 56% did not reach platelet counts of 50,000 microl within 12 weeks. In fostamatinib responders and others, the exposure adjusted incidences of rescue therapy use observed was 0.26 and 0.86 patient-year, respectively, the incidences of hemorrhage &amp;gt;/= 1 adverse event (AE) and &amp;gt;/= 1 serious AE was 0.34 and 0.06, and 0.70 and 0.16 patient-year, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2098602" linkType="Reference"&gt;2098602&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In January 2007, Rigel started enrollment and dosing in the phase II study (&lt;ulink linkID="20837" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00706342&lt;/ulink&gt;; D4300C0022; C-935788-007) of fostamatinib for refractory ITP. The US, single-center, ascending-dose, proof-of-concept study would include patients with chronic refractory ITP. The primary endpoint was improved platelet counts, and the drug's safety would also be tested [&lt;ulink linkID="755759" linkType="Reference"&gt;755759&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="733002" linkType="Reference"&gt;733002&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2007, interim data from the trial were reported. Patients received twice-daily doses of 75 to 125 mg of fostamatinib, for at least 30 days. The amended protocol requests an expansion of the dose ranges and duration. The drug was shown to be safe, well tolerated and to raise platelet counts. The company submitted an amended protocol following the results, for the expansion of the trial in terms of dose range and duration [&lt;ulink linkID="782440" linkType="Reference"&gt;782440&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were reported in November 2007. Of 14 patients, nine had higher stable platelet counts, six of those had peak platelet counts of greater than 100,000 platelets/microl. The primary side effects were gastrointestinal-related [&lt;ulink linkID="849798" linkType="Reference"&gt;849798&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2007, similar clinical data were presented at the 49th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA [&lt;ulink linkID="858217" linkType="Reference"&gt;858217&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2008, further ITP trials were delayed until a collaboration partner was found [&lt;ulink linkID="958462" linkType="Reference"&gt;958462&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The study was completed in April 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1192635" linkType="Reference"&gt;1192635&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2014, data were presented at the 32nd Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, CA. Of the 16 patients enrolled, 8 achieved a stable response with platelet counts of &amp;gt; 30,000 and &amp;gt; 50,000 platelets/microl recorded at 100 and 94% of evaluations, respectively. A further four patients achieved a variable response with platelet counts of &amp;gt; 30,000 and &amp;gt; 50,000 platelets/microl recorded at 48 and 21% of evaluations, respectively. Four patients were non-responders with platelet counts of &amp;lt; 30,000 platelets/microl at all evaluations [&lt;ulink linkID="1518332" linkType="Reference"&gt;1518332&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2005, at the 47th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA, results from a phase I trial for ITP were presented.

The trial was to be a placebo-controlled trial of patients (expected n = 80) with primary or secondary warm AIHA who have failed at least one prior treatment. The primary endpoint was to be a durable hemoglobin response by week 24, with  response not being attributed to rescue therapy. At that time, the company planned to initiate the trial in the first half of 2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="2091172" linkType="Reference"&gt;2091172&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2019, the company expected to conduct the trial in the US, Western Europe, Central Europe, Canada and Australia [&lt;ulink linkID="2108577" linkType="Reference"&gt;2108577&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2019, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study (&lt;ulink linkID="362550" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT03764618&lt;/ulink&gt;; C-935788-057) was initiated in the US and Georgia in patients (expected n = 80) with warm AIHA.

In May 2019, Rigel had opened  trial sites  and enrollment of the first patient was expected   later that month. Topline  results were expected in  early 2021 [&lt;ulink linkID="2148917" linkType="Reference"&gt;2148917&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later in May 2019, the first patient was enrolled in the pivotal trial [&lt;ulink linkID="2152304" linkType="Reference"&gt;2152304&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2016, the company planned to initiate a phase II study in  AIHA.

In February 2016, an open-label, multi-center, two-stage, phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="246793" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02612558&lt;/ulink&gt;; C-935788-053; SOAR) was initiated in the US and Canada to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fostamatinib disodium in patients (expected n = 37) with warm antibody AIHA. Stage 1 would enroll 17 patients who would receive fostamatinib 150 mg bid      for  12 weeks. Stage 2 would begin after enrollment in Stage 1  completed and would include an additional 20 patients who  would receive the same treatment protocol as Stage 1. The primary endpoint was to achieve increased hemoglobin levels by week 12 of greater than 10 g/dl, and greater than or equal to 2 g/dl higher than baseline [&lt;ulink linkID="1737778" linkType="Reference"&gt;1737778&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2091984" linkType="Reference"&gt;2091984&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In October 2017, Stage 1 of the SOAR study was completed with 17 patients enrolled. Topline data were reported, which showed Stage 1of the trial met its primary endpoint [&lt;ulink linkID="1967374" linkType="Reference"&gt;1967374&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2017, enrollment in stage 2 had been initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="1994989" linkType="Reference"&gt;1994989&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2018, an additional patient in the Stage 1 extension study met the response criteria and 53% (9 of 17) of evaluable patients achieved a response to fostamatinib treatment. Also, six patients achieved a response during the 12-week evaluation period, and an additional three patients met the response criteria in the extension study after 12 weeks of dosing [&lt;ulink linkID="2010931" linkType="Reference"&gt;2010931&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In June 2018, preliminary results were presented at the 23rd EHA Annual Congress in Stockholm, Sweden. In general, responses observed were rapid and sustained, with five out of nine responses achieved within 4 weeks. Median duration of first response was 16.6 weeks. A tendency toward decreasing lactate dehydrogenase and reticulocytes and increasing haptoglobin was noted. Diarrhea and dizziness were the most frequently reported adverse events. A total of three patients experienced serious adverse events, and none were associated with fostamatinib [&lt;ulink linkID="2045691" linkType="Reference"&gt;2045691&lt;/ulink&gt;].  Later that month, similar data were presented at the 2018 Annual FOCIS Meeting in San Francisco, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="2105079" linkType="Reference"&gt;2105079&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In December 2018, further data from an ongoing extension phase were presented at the 60th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in San Diego, CA. Of nine patients who entered the extension phase, seven had met the primary endpoint, one was late responders, and one had a beneficial trend during the initial treatment phase. There was increase in median hemoglobin levels over the course of the study (initial plus extension phase). Of nine patients, six were still on study, and three discontinued treatment due to lack of response + adverse event (AE), withdrew consent and unknown reason. As of data cutoff date, five had an ongoing response to fostamatinib, and none had rescued therapy or an RBC transfusion. Hypokalemia (unrelated to treatment; n = 1) and fatigue (related to treatment; n = 1) were grade 3 AEs. Overall, AEs appeared manageable  [&lt;ulink linkID="2098462" linkType="Reference"&gt;2098462&lt;/ulink&gt;].

The trial did not achieve its primary endpoint. However, in a pre-specified subgroup analysis of patients with &amp;gt;1 g/day  proteinuria at baseline, data showed a greater reduction in proteinuria in the treated arm compared with placebo. The drug was  tolerated, with no new safety signals. Additional analysis, including histology, were expected later that year [&lt;ulink linkID="2018919" linkType="Reference"&gt;2018919&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, the study was expected to complete in December 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1626947" linkType="Reference"&gt;1626947&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2019, further data were presented at the 2019 World Congress of Nephrology in Melbourne, Australia. Both the doses of fostamatinib reduced proteinuria compared to baseline, however the differences were not significant. In a pre-specified subgroup analysis of patients with baseline sPCR &amp;gt;/= 1000 mg/g, a dose dependent reduction in sPCR was observed with fostamatinib 100 (-720 mg/g) and 150 mg (-803 mg/g), which did not reach significance. No significant changes in eGFR were observed during the study. Investigation of serial renal biopsies showed that there were no significant changes in median Oxford classification scores.

The maximum-tolerated dose was 50 mg bid for CRC but was not established for the other cancers. There were no responses in the study. The disease stabilization rate was 27% in CRC patients. In CRC patients, a better disease stabilization rate was associated with a reduction in circulating endothelial cells (CECs) following treatment (75 versus 0%). The observed pharmacokinetic profile was similar to previous reports. Results showed that four of the first five patients enrolled had dose limiting toxicities. Transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypertension were the commonly observed grade 3/4 adverse events in the study.

In June 2012, clinical data were presented at EULAR 2012 in Berlin, Germany. The mean Cmax and AUC values of R-406 were found to be lower in the renally impaired groups, compared with the normal renal function groups and the median Tmax value was similar across all treatment groups. Exposure of R-406 was lower post-dialysis compared with predialysis in ESRD subjects. Urinary excretion of R-406 N-glucuronide was lower with increasing severity of renal impairment and renal elimination of R-406 was negligible in all groups [&lt;ulink linkID="1296315" linkType="Reference"&gt;1296315&lt;/ulink&gt; ]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Also in November 2005, at the 63rd ACAAI meeting in Anaheim, CA, data were presented on R-406 tested for inhibition of basophil CD63. Normal healthy volunteers received ascending, single, oral doses of 80 to 600 mg R-406 or vehicle placebo in a randomized, double-blind fashion. There was a significant dose response in CD63 expression compared to baseline; doses greater than 250 mg had good bioavailability and a greater than 90% inhibition of CD63 expression at 2-6 h post dose, with a dose response up to 24 h [&lt;ulink linkID="637146" linkType="Reference"&gt;637146&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Data published in 2005 showed that R-406 would be expected to have similar effects on Fcγ receptor signaling and thus can potentially be used to treat arthritis, or other inflammatory conditions, by blocking FcγR activation related to autoantibody engagement, reducing macrophage-mediated joint inflammation and cartilage destruction [&lt;ulink linkID="917491" linkType="Reference"&gt;917491&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="917492" linkType="Reference"&gt;917492&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2004, R-406 was selected as the lead from a series of Syk kinase inhibitors [&lt;ulink linkID="520320" linkType="Reference"&gt;520320&lt;/ulink&gt;] and, in December 2004, it entered phase I trials. The placebo-controlled trial was to include 36 volunteers and be followed by a multiple dose study including an additional 24 people [&lt;ulink linkID="577303" linkType="Reference"&gt;577303&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2005, preliminary results showed the drug to be well tolerated, with a strong correlation between plasma levels and the inhibition of its target.

In a 28-day study using syngeneic LOU rats, R-091 resulted a dose-related reduction in the severity of bone destruction. This outcome was evident within the first 72 hours after arthritis onset and continued to improve throughout the study, and was the case both with a prophylactic protocol as well as with a treatment protocol. At that time, it was revealed that R-091 was not intended to move into the clinic since far more potent third and fourth-generation compounds had been developed.

Syk is a key mediator of Fc and B-cell receptor signaling in inflammatory cells, such as B-cells, mast cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Preclinical studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in major inflammatory mediators such as TNFalpha, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-18, leading to reduced inflammation and bone degradation. Fostamatinib is orally bioavailable and was well tolerated in phase I and II trials, with the most common side effect being gastrointestinal symptoms. In a phase II trial, fostamatinib treatment improved response rates in patients with RA. Patients with B-cell lymphomas also responded to treatment and those with ITP had their platelet counts increased. At the time of publication, data from the phase II trials were being analyzed. The Syk inhibitor appears to be a promising therapeutic for immunological diseases, but further data are required to establish the efficacy and long-term safety of the drug.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, with an annual global population incidence of approximately 3 per 100,000 and a prevalence rate of approximately 1% [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="979220"&gt;979220&lt;/ulink&gt;]. RA is associated with significant morbidity, as the associated inflammatory processes cause the destruction of cartilage and bone, leading to joint swelling and pain and, ultimately, joint destruction. Up to 90% of patients with severe synovitis (inflammation of the synovial membrane lining joints often associated with RA) have evidence of bone erosion [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="979221"&gt;979221&lt;/ulink&gt;]. RA is generally 2- to 3-fold more frequent in women than in men, and can begin to develop at any age, with a peak onset generally between the age group of 25 to 55 years [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="979220"&gt;979220&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is expressed in most hematopoietic cells (including macrophages and neutrophils) and is involved in the regulation of platelet and endothelial cell function, and has a limited role in innate immunity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976412"&gt;976412&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Syk is activated via Fc receptor (FcR) signaling through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976412"&gt;976412&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Immunocomplexes, auto-antibodies and FcR signaling all play a role in the development of RA [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="979223"&gt;979223&lt;/ulink&gt;], validating the involvement of Syk in RA pathogenesis. FcR gamma-chain (FcRgamma) signal transduction is dependent on ITAMs located in the cytoplasmic tail. The binding of Syk to ITAM activates the downstream signaling events that eventually lead to an increased release of cytokine and lipid mediators, such as cysteinyl leukotrienes and proteases [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="979224"&gt;979224&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These mediators cause the inflammation and damage to the tissue and cartilage that is characteristic of RA. Syk is also essential for the downstream signaling of DAP12 receptors that are present in NK-cells and in osteoclasts (and thus regulates bone damage), B-cell receptors present in B-cells, and glycoprotein VI receptors present in platelets [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976412"&gt;976412&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976414"&gt;976414&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="978166"&gt;978166&lt;/ulink&gt;]. As most of these Syk-ITAM-associated receptors are localized in immunological cells, Syk is thus a key component to the activation of immune cells that play critical roles in the pathogenesis of RA.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In comparison with the targets of currently available therapies for RA, Syk has notable features. Anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-10 or IL-13) and agents targeting proinflammatory cytokines (eg, TNFalpha or IL-1beta have the potential to interfere with the process of inflammation and osteoclast activation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976408"&gt;976408&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Despite the evident success of biological therapies, concerns remain regarding their immunosuppressive effects and the associated increased risk of tuberculosis and lymphoma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="974890"&gt;974890&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="974894"&gt;974894&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="979225"&gt;979225&lt;/ulink&gt;]; additionally, methotrexate causes side effects such as mouth sores, stomach upset and low white blood cell counts [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976437"&gt;976437&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Along with these safety concerns and side effects, some patients do not respond to these interventions [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="737636"&gt;737636&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, biological therapies do not induce permanent remission, are expensive and are associated with the pain involved from continuous injections [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="891727"&gt;891727&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="891738"&gt;891738&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="892231"&gt;892231&lt;/ulink&gt;]; the use of these therapies is thus limited as the disease progresses. Other therapies for the treatment of RA, such as the corticosteroid prednisolone, also cause complications, such as bone loss, susceptibility to infections and cutaneous atrophy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="979226"&gt;979226&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The steroid approach provides only symptomatic relief, and is consequently losing popularity as a therapeutic alternative for RA.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Therefore, targeting a signaling molecule that is expressed in major immune cells and has multifunctional roles in the progression of the disease (ie, acting at various levels of the disease, such as inflammation and damage to the bone and tissue with minimum side effects, and also modifying the disease to cause remission) could be the best option for identifying a longer-term therapeutic solution for RA. A small-molecule inhibitor of Syk with better bioavailability (ie, oral administration) and actions only at the site of damage could serve as an improved therapeutic alternative. Thus, Syk inhibition in RA therapy could prevent damage to bones, cartilage and tissues by inhibiting osteoclast signaling and by preventing matrix metalloprotease (MMP) release (which causes cartilage and tissue damage in patients with RA [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="979227"&gt;979227&lt;/ulink&gt;]), in addition to preventing inflammation by reducing the release of cytokines such as TNFalpha, IL-1 and IL-6.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Additional indications that could potentially be treated by a Syk inhibitor are lymphoma and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Lymphomas are blood cancers that result when lymphocytes grow uncontrollably and accumulate in the lymphatic system, and when bone marrow produces malignant tumors. From 2001 to 2005, the incidence rate of lymphomas was 22.2/100,000 individuals per year in the US, of which 19.5/100,000 individuals per year had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) varieties of the disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976436"&gt;976436&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of NHL and is generally categorized as aggressive and marked by rapidly growing tumors in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow and other organs. Several treatment options exist, including &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6736"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy and radiation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976415"&gt;976415&lt;/ulink&gt;], but the 5-year survival rate for patients with NHL is estimated to be 50% [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="974902"&gt;974902&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Even for those patients who respond to anti-CD20 treatment, recurrence of the disease is common. Therefore, alternative therapeutic options as a second line of treatment are essential.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The uncontrolled growth of tumor cells, specifically B-cells, is partially mediated by the Syk enzyme, which signals the growth/survival mechanism of aberrant B-cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="974875"&gt;974875&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By inhibiting Syk, the signal is curtailed and the aberrant cells cannot proliferate. Syk is involved in pre-B-cell development and maturation, and appears to amplify B-cell antigen receptor signaling, which may be an important survival mechanism in certain B-cell lymphomas [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="974875"&gt;974875&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Recent reports have also demonstrated that Syk levels and activity are elevated in follicular lymphoma cells, and that Syk is involved in mTOR activation in these cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="974968"&gt;974968&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The inhibition of Syk by the Syk inhibitor piceatannol or by siRNA plasmids has resulted in a potent inhibition of mTOR activity in follicular lymphoma cells, as well as in mantle cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="974968"&gt;974968&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These findings suggest that Syk could be a promising new target for B-cell lymphoma therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976422"&gt;976422&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;ITP is an autoimmune condition in which antibodies attack and destroy blood platelets, which play an active role in blood clotting and healing. In the US, ITP affects approximately 2 in 100,000 adults per year and 5 in 100,000 children per year [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976435"&gt;976435&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients with ITP have a low platelet count and consequently experience bruising, bleeding and fatigue. The first-line therapy includes steroids, which are initially effective in 50 to 75% of cases, but then decline in efficacy over time [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976413"&gt;976413&lt;/ulink&gt;]. When steroids fail as treatments, surgical procedures are used to remove the spleen; however, as well as being vulnerable to the risks associated with surgery, patients will be more prone to infections. Other therapies, such as second-generation thrombopoeitin (TPO) peptide mimetics, TPO non-peptide mimetics and TPO agonists, have been developed to boost platelet production. These agents include the TPO peptide mimetic &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="40694"&gt;romiplostim&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="14109"&gt;Amgen Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="973962"&gt;973962&lt;/ulink&gt;]; the TPO non-peptide mimetics &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="10606"&gt;eltrombopag&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="28355"&gt;GlaxoSmithKline plc&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17808"&gt;Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="965443"&gt;965443&lt;/ulink&gt;], &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54683"&gt;AKR-501&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18203"&gt;MGI Pharma Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="825627"&gt;825627&lt;/ulink&gt;] and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54484"&gt;LGD-4665&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="28355"&gt;GlaxoSmithKline plc&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="971864"&gt;971864&lt;/ulink&gt;]; and the TPO agonist &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="53358"&gt;totrombopag&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="28355"&gt;GlaxoSmithKline plc&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17808"&gt;Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="635953"&gt;635953&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;However, these therapies mainly focus on the symptomatic relief, and not the cause, of the disease. Immune cells recognize the antibodies attached to platelets through FcR, leading to the FcR-mediated destruction of the antibody and the attached platelet [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976421"&gt;976421&lt;/ulink&gt;]. FcR-based therapies have been known to demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of ITP, and a clinical trial with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="53284"&gt;GMA-161&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="29060"&gt;MacroGenics Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="16299"&gt;Genzyme Corp&lt;/ulink&gt;], a mAb to FcgammaRIII, was ongoing for the treatment of this condition [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="747256"&gt;747256&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="931647"&gt;931647&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Syk, regulating downstream signaling of FcR, could be targeted and thus provide a therapeutic option that tackles the cause of ITP.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Fostamatinib is a prodrug of &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="25471"&gt;Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;'s Syk inhibitor R-406 that is under development by the company for the potential treatment of RA, B-cell lymphoma and for the prevention of ITP. At the time of publication, phase II clinical trials were ongoing for these indications [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="858217"&gt;858217&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="912576"&gt;912576&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="915976"&gt;915976&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Fostamatinib has also been investigated for the potential treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and type 1 diabetes [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="894238"&gt;894238&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="900869"&gt;900869&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the time of publication, development for SLE was placed on hold until a collaboration partner was identified [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="958462"&gt;958462&lt;/ulink&gt;], and development for type 1 diabetes was no longer being pursued by Rigel [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="976459"&gt;976459&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Using cell-based SAR studies with cultured human mast cells (CHMCs), researchers at Rigel identified compounds that inhibited FcRepsilon-mediated signal transduction by inhibiting Syk [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="733002"&gt;733002&lt;/ulink&gt;]. R-406, selected as a lead compound, was demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of FcRepsilon-dependent activation (EC50 = 43 nM); IgE-mediated degranulation of CHMCs and the release of leukotriene C(4), cytokines and chemokines (including TNFalpha and IL-8) were inhibited by R-406 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="749713"&gt;749713&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The low aqueous solubility of R-406 required the development of the prodrug fostamatinib [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="733002"&gt;733002&lt;/ulink&gt;], in particular the disodium salt of fostamatinib [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3641129"&gt;WO-2008064274&lt;/ulink&gt;], which is the formulation administered in preclinical and clinical studies.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Fostamatinib was synthesized by selective alkylation of the morpholine nitrogen of 4H-pyrido[3,2-b][1,4]oxazin-3-one ring [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3641129"&gt;WO-2008064274&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A mixture of N4-(2,2-dimethyl-3-oxo-4H-5-pyrido[1,4]oxazin-6-yl)-5-fluoro-N2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2.4-pyrimidinediamine, cesium carbonate and di-tert-butyl chloromethyl phosphate in dimethylformamide was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen. The reaction was monitored by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, and after 92% conversion (at 30 h), the reaction mixture was poured onto ice water. After work-up, decolorization and crystallization, fostamatinib was obtained in 90% yield and 97% purity. Sodium hydroxide was added to a suspension of fostamatinib and water at pH 3.6 to 3.7, to adjust the pH to 9.3 to 10.3. The mixture was heated to reflux, formed solids were filtered, the filtrate was treated with isopropanol, and the clear solution was cooled to room temperature over 1.5 h. The resultant precipitate was filtered, rinsed with isopropanol, then taken up in acetone to form a slurry and stirred at room temperature for 1.5 h. The formed solids were filtered, rinsed with acetone, dried at 40degC to remove solvents, and exposed to air at 40% humidity and room temperature until water content stabilized, yielding the disodium salt of fostamatinib as a pure-white, highly crystalline material [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3641129"&gt;WO-2008064274&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Alternative syntheses and different salt preparations were also described in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3641129"&gt;WO-2008064274&lt;/ulink&gt;.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vitro&lt;/subtitle&gt;The Syk inhibitor R-406 demonstrated ATP-competitive inhibition of Syk activity (Ki = 30 nM) and inhibition of Syk activity (IC50 = 41 nM) in vitro; the compound inhibited 78% of Syk activity at a concentration of 0.3 microM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="749713"&gt;749713&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="771815"&gt;771815&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In an isolated enzyme assay, R-406 inhibited the kinases Lyn (IC50 = 63 nM), the activation of which leads to FcRgamma chain phosphorylation, and Lck (IC50 = 37 nM), a tyrosine kinase involved in T-cell receptor-mediated signaling. Despite similar IC50 values for these isolated kinases, R-406 exhibited selectivity in cell-based assays; measurements of the phosphorylation of target proteins of respective kinases indicated that Syk-mediated phosphorylation was inhibited, but that R-406 did not inhibit Lyn- and Lck-mediated phosphorylation, nor JAK1/3-, c-Kit- and Flt3-mediated phosphorylation. R-406 was 5- to 100-fold less potent against Lyn, Lck, JAK1/3, c-Kit and Flt3 compared with its potency against Syk [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="749713"&gt;749713&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Syk-dependent pathways mediated by FcRgamma signaling in human mast cells, macrophages and neutrophils were inhibited by R-406 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="749713"&gt;749713&lt;/ulink&gt;]. To assess the role of Syk and the potential of R-406 in RA, the effect of R-406 on Syk-mediated pathways was investigated in TNFalpha-stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes isolated from joint tissues of patients with RA. R-406 inhibited TNFalpha-induced Syk-dependent phosphorylation of c-JNK and ERK1/2, but not p38. The TNFalpha-induced production of IL-6 and MMP3, both implicated in the pathogenesis of RA, was also significantly decreased by R-406 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="771815"&gt;771815&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Additionally, in IgE-sensitized murine bone marrow-derived mast cells, R-406 prevented ovalbumin-induced degranulation and inhibited the production of IL-2, IL-6, IL-13 and TNFalpha [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="975244"&gt;975244&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Studies also demonstrated that R-406 and fostamatinib inhibited the proliferation of multiple B-cell lymphoma cell lines and tumorigenic pre-B-cells in leukemia cell lines. The proliferation of B-cell lines was reduced (IC50 = 625 to 2500 nM) without having an effect on T-cell or myeloid lineage cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="975362"&gt;975362&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A cell cycle analysis of B-cells demonstrated a reduction in the B-cell S-phase, an increase in the G1/G0-phase, and an increase in apoptosis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="975362"&gt;975362&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In response to B-cell receptor stimulation in primary B-cell lymphoma samples, R-406 inhibited peripheral blood B-cell proliferation with an IC50 value of 100 nM, and completely blocked proliferation at a concentration of 2500 nM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="860425"&gt;860425&lt;/ulink&gt;]. B-cell receptor-mediated signaling was blocked by R-406, with the complete prevention of phosphorylation of downstream proteins including ERK, Akt and p38 at a concentration of 2500 nM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="860425"&gt;860425&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a panel of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines, R-406 inhibited proliferation with IC50 values of 900 to 1800 nM, and caused apoptosis in 30 to 85% of cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917485"&gt;917485&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="974875"&gt;974875&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The Syk variant TEL-Syk transformed pre-B-cells, increased c-Myc expression, caused defective differentiation and induced leukemia; the proliferation of TEL-Syk-transformed pre-B-cells was investigated with and without R-406 (2000 nM) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="761158"&gt;761158&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In untreated transformed pre-B-cells, 51% of the cells were in the S/G2-phase of the cell cycle and thus proliferating. Upon treatment with R-406, 4% of cells were proliferating, and the majority of the cells (96%) were in the G1-phase. R-406 reduced the expression of c-Myc and allowed the differentiation of transformed pre-B-cells into mature B-cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="761158"&gt;761158&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Moreover, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, R-406 antagonized B-cell receptor-mediated cell migration, adhesion and co-stimulatory-molecule expression, and B-cell survival [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="967106"&gt;967106&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vivo&lt;/subtitle&gt;Immunocomplex-mediated tissue injury was investigated by assessing the Reverse Passive Arthus disease reaction (RPA) in rats. The intravenous injection of an antigen (ovalbumin) followed by the intradermal injection of antibodies specific to ovalbumin caused perivascular deposition of immunocomplexes and rapid inflammatory responses characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration and hemorrhage at the injection site. The administration of R-406 (1 to 10 mg/kg iv) or fostamatinib (10 or 30 mg/kg po) 1 h prior to antibody administration dose-dependently reduced the cutaneous RPA reaction and inflammatory edema [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917341"&gt;917341&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At a dose of 10 mg/kg of R-406, extravascular leakage of Evans blue dye (a measure of severity of local edema) and tissue swelling was reduced by approximately 72% compared with a vehicle control. A reduction in these parameters of approximately 70 and 90% was observed after the administration of 10 and 30 mg/kg of fostamatinib, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917341"&gt;917341&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;R-406 was also evaluated in a model of arthritis induced in Balb/c mice by intravenous injection of a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mAb blend via the tail vein [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="749713"&gt;749713&lt;/ulink&gt;]. R-406 (5 and 10 mg/kg po, bid) was dosed within 4 h of antibody injection (day 0) for 14 days. The severity of arthritis in hind paws was scored daily (scale of 0 to 4 per paw to yield a sum of both hind paws). By day 5, both saline and vehicle control reached peak scores, with a disease incidence of 100%. Arthritis progression and inflammation were reduced in animals treated with R-406, with a disease incidence of 100% on day 10. R-406 treatment significantly reduced the score (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and damage to the joints compared with vehicle-treated animals [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="749713"&gt;749713&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Moreover, the administration of R-406 (10 or 30 mg/kg po, bid) and fostamatinib (15 or 30 mg/kg/day po) to CIA rat models after disease onset caused a suppression of the characteristics of arthritis including tissue swelling, joint space narrowing, inflammatory cell infiltration into the synovial fluid and tissue, inflammatory cytokine secretion into the joint space, bone erosion and the accumulation of cartilage degradation products in the serum [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917341"&gt;917341&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The ability of fostamatinib to ameliorate ITP was assessed in a murine model of the disease. The injection of an antibody directed to integrin alpha2beta resulted in profound ITP in mice at 24 h post injection. Pretreatment with fostamatinib (25 or 40 mg/kg, administration route not stated) protected mice from the development of ITP, compared with untreated controls [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="640784"&gt;640784&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The potential of fostamatinib in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia was evaluated in mice xenografted with leukemic MV411 cells. The administration of fostamatinib (40 and 80 mg/kg bid) significantly reduced tumor growth by 45 and 82%, at the respective doses, compared with controls [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="641305"&gt;641305&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Additionally, fostamatinib has been assessed in lupus-prone mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="900869"&gt;900869&lt;/ulink&gt;] and in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="894238"&gt;894238&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The administration of fostamatinib to lupus-prone mice prior to or after disease onset delayed the onset of proteinuria and azotemia, reduced renal pathology and kidney infiltrates, and significantly prolonged survival, suggesting therapeutic benefits of fostamatinib in lupus disorders [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="900869"&gt;900869&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The administration of fostamatinib to mice with type 1 diabetes blocked Syk signaling, delayed the onset of diabetes, prolonged survival and reduced the production of insulin-specific auto-antibodies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="894238"&gt;894238&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;The effect of R-406 on the CNS, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, and interaction with hERG (the blockade of which can lead to prolonged ECG QT intervals [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="978168"&gt;978168&lt;/ulink&gt;]) demonstrated that R-406 was generally well tolerated in animals; a slight reduction in heart rate, an increase in cardiac RR intervals (ie, decreased heart rate) and a slight effect on some behavioral parameters was noted at a dose of 50 mg/kg (further details on respiratory and hERG parameters were not available) [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3216945"&gt;WO-2006078846&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a 28-day toxicity study, R-406 (10 or 100 mg/kg/day po, bid) administered to Sprague-Dawley rats did not cause changes in appearance and/or behavior [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917342"&gt;917342&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At 100 mg/kg/day, a reduction in lymphocytes, thymic and spleen weight, and bone marrow cellularity was observed; these effects resolved during a 14-day recovery period. At this dose, T-cell, B-cell and NK-cell numbers were slightly decreased. However, when rats were challenged with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, there was no change in the humoral IgG and IgM responses compared with vehicle controls [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917342"&gt;917342&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similarly, a reversible effect on bone marrow cellularity in monkeys was observed (no further details were available) [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3216945"&gt;WO-2006078846&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The reports suggested that no toxicity would be observed following the administration of 10 to 30 mg/kg/day of R-406 to rats and 100 mg/kg/day to monkeys [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3216945"&gt;WO-2006078846&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The immunotoxicity of fostamatinib (up to 100 mg/kg/day po, bid for 28 days) was also assessed in host-resistant Balb/c mouse models of Listeria, Streptococci or influenza; immunotoxicity would be evident by an inability or reduced ability to eliminate infections. Fostamatinib did not affect bacterial or viral clearance in any of these models [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917342"&gt;917342&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Additionally, Syk-deficient mice have been demonstrated to display bleeding diathesis. In mice treated with R-406 (dose not stated), no significant difference in bleeding time compared with untreated mice or mice treated with a control vehicle were observed [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="640784"&gt;640784&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism and pharmacokinetics&lt;/subtitle&gt;Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that fostamatinib had superior bioavailability and solubility compared with R-406 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917341"&gt;917341&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The administration of fostamatinib (4 mg/kg po) to Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in a bioavailability of 29.9% [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3216945"&gt;WO-2006078846&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Fostamatinib is highly polar at neutral pH, whereas R-406 is highly lipophilic and weakly ionizable, and thus only soluble in a non-aqueous medium. Unlike R-406, the absorption of fostamatinib is not dependent on formulation. The oral administration of fostamatinib (4 mg/kg) in different formulations (ie, in PEG-400, carboxymethylcellulose or gelatin) did not affect the absorption of the drug (AUC = 914, 1083 and 1049 ng.h/ml, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3216945"&gt;WO-2006078846&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with both intravenous and oral formulations of fostamatinib and R-406 in Sprague-Dawley rats [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3216945"&gt;WO-2006078846&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Following intravenous administration, fostamatinib was rapidly converted to R-406, which could be detected in plasma. Following oral administration, fostamatinib was not present in the systemic circulation, but high levels of R-406 were detected. Upon oral administration of R-406 (2.5 mg/kg) and fostamatinib (4 mg/kg), the values for AUC/dose were approximately identical, indicating that the two compounds were absorbed equally [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3216945"&gt;WO-2006078846&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The conversion of fostamatinib to R-406 was examined using microsomal preparations, and demonstrated that fostamatinib was converted to R-406 in both intestinal and liver microsomal preparations by phosphatases [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3216945"&gt;WO-2006078846&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Following the administration of R-406 (10 or 30 mg/kg po, bid) to Lewis rats, the AUC0-16 h values were 7295 and 17,951 ng.h/ml at the respective doses; Cmax values of 1500 and 4500 ng/ml were obtained after 1 and 2 h [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917341"&gt;917341&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The administration of a single dose of fostamatinib (10 and 20 mg/kg po) resulted in AUC0-16 h values for R-406 of 10,618 and 30,650 ng.h/ml, respectively. Cmax values for the respective doses were 2600 and 6500 ng/ml, and were achieved after 1 h. The half-life of fostamatinib was 4.2 h. Fostamatinib was not detected in the plasma, indicating a complete conversion to R-406 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917341"&gt;917341&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The inhibition of FcR signaling should reduce clearance and extend the half-life of antibodies administered therapeutically [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917341"&gt;917341&lt;/ulink&gt;]. To assess this effect, a single dose of R-406 (30 mg/kg) was administered in combination with an anti-TNFalpha antibody to rats with CIA; R-406 increased levels of anti-TNFalpha antibodies by 33% [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917341"&gt;917341&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers (n = 24) administered R-406 (100 to 300 mg po, bid for 7 days), the half-life of the compound exceeded 12 h [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917491"&gt;917491&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Plasma concentrations of 1 to 5 microM were produced by 100- to 200-mg doses of R-406, while plasma concentrations increased nonlinearly relative to lower doses at a dose of 300 mg, ranging from 10 to 20 microM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917491"&gt;917491&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Following the administration of R-406 (80 to 600 mg po) to healthy volunteers (n = 35), pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis suggested an EC50 value in the range of 1 microM (5 to 600 ng/ml) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917491"&gt;917491&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase I, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, fostamatinib (100 mg po, bid for 7 days) in combination with methotraxate was administered to patients with RA (n = 16) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917343"&gt;917343&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No changes in plasma or urine levels of either methotrexate or 7-hydroxymethotrexate before or after dosing with fostamatinib were noted. Before and after the administration of fostamatinib, plasma AUC values for methotrexate were 1590 and 2520 ng.h/ml, plasma AUC values for 7-hydroxymethotrexate were 1220 and 1540 ng.h/ml, the urinary excretion of methotrexate was 7.1 and 9.8 mg, and the urinary excretion of 7-hydroxymethotrexate was 0.5 and 0.6 mg, respectively.

The primary endpoint included the percentage of patients achieving an ACR20 response (ie, at least 20% improvement in endpoints such as swollen joints and tendons according to the American College of Rheumatology [ACR]) after 12 weeks of treatment. Fostamatinib treatment at doses of 100 and 150 mg resulted in higher ACR20, ACR50, ACR70 and Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 response rates than the placebo group and 50-mg fostamatinib group. The ACR20 response rates were 38, 32, 65 and 72% in the placebo, 50-, 100- and 150-mg fostamatinib groups, respectively; ACR50 response rates were 19, 17, 49 and 57%; ACR70 response rates were 4, 2, 33 and 40%; and the DAS28 response rates were 17, 20, 35 and 47%, respectively. Levels of IL-6 and MMP3 were significantly decreased from baseline with dosing of 100 and 150 mg. The onset of effects occurred within 1 week of treatment initiation at the 100- and 150-mg doses of fostamatinib [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="962289"&gt;962289&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="975916"&gt;975916&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Two phase II clinical trials in patients with RA were ongoing at the time of publication [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="915976"&gt;915976&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The first was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="11566"&gt;NCT00665925&lt;/ulink&gt;; TASKI-2) in methotrexate-resistant patients with RA (n = 420); patients would receive a stable dose of methotrexate plus fostamatinib (100 or 150 mg po, bid) for 6 months. The second was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="11565"&gt;NCT00665626&lt;/ulink&gt;; TASKI-3) in patients with RA (n = 195) who had failed to respond to at least one marketed biological agent; patients would receive fostamatinib (100 mg po, bid) for 3 months and would be permitted to continue methotrexate and/or other therapies. The primary endpoint for both trials was efficacy (determined by ACR20 response rates), while the secondary endpoints included ACR50, ACR70 and DAS28 response rates, and safety assessment. The TASKI-3 trial would also measure changes in bone morphology using MRI scans [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="915976"&gt;915976&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Enrollment in both trials was expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2009, and initial results were to be released by late summer of 2009 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="958462"&gt;958462&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, a phase II, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, active-control, parallel-assignment trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="38178"&gt;NCT00805467&lt;/ulink&gt;) was recruiting patients with RA (n = 800) who had completed previous Rigel-sponsored trials of fostamatinib, to investigate long-term safety.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Immune thrombocytopenic purpura&lt;br/&gt;A phase II, single-center, open-label, ascending-dose, proof-of-concept clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="20837"&gt;NCT00706342&lt;/ulink&gt;) was also ongoing in patients with ITP (n = 16) who had previously undergone and failed to respond to available treatments.

Patients had previously received standard treatments, such as the drug combination CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin [adriamycin], oncovin [vincristine] and prednisone/prednisolone). In the phase I part of the trial, two cohorts of patients (n = 13 in total) received fostamatinib (200 or 250 mg po, bid); the lower dose was selected for further study [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="912576"&gt;912576&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="980023"&gt;980023&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Response to treatment was assessed using the Cheston criteria for NHL. Of the 68 patients enrolled, 23 had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 21 had follicular NHL, 11 had CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), 9 had mantle cell lymphoma, 1 had lymphoplasmacytic NHL and 3 had mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. No response was observed in the patients with lymphoplasmacytic NHL or MALT lymphoma.

This trial was ongoing at the time of publication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At the time of publication, a phase II, multicenter, open-label clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="37092"&gt;NCT00798096&lt;/ulink&gt;) was planned to assess the efficacy of fostamatinib (200 mg po, bid) in patients with refractory/relapsed T-cell lymphoma (n = 61).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Systemic lupus erythematosus&lt;br/&gt;A phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="28907"&gt;NCT00752999&lt;/ulink&gt;) was to assess the efficacy and safety of fostamatinib (150 mg po, bid) in patients with SLE (n = 225). At the time of publication, the trial had been suspended [NCT00752999]. Similar to development for the ITP indication, Rigel deferred the initiation of any further trials for SLE until a partner for collaboration could be identified [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="958462"&gt;958462&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side effects and contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;In the clinical trials conducted to date, fostamatinib and R-406 were well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="858217"&gt;858217&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="912576"&gt;912576&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917343"&gt;917343&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917491"&gt;917491&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="917492"&gt;917492&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="962289"&gt;962289&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="975916"&gt;975916&lt;/ulink&gt;].

No equivalent regional patents had been granted by January 2009.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;The role of auto-antibodies, immunocomplexes and FcRgamma in the pathogenesis of various immunological diseases such as RA, ITP and lymphoma has been well documented. Immunoreceptors, such as FcR and B-cell receptors, are important for both allergic and antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases; thus, interference with Syk, which regulates downstream signaling pathways, may be a useful therapeutic target.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Novel and effective therapeutic options in RA are required urgently, given that current treatments have potentially significant limitations. Most available therapies target only one aspect of this multifaceted and complex disease. The current understanding of the pathophysiology of RA suggests that monotherapies may not be the solution. Common therapies for RA, such as methotrexate and corticosteroids, mainly suppress inflammation and pain. However, several therapies, such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7274"&gt;anakinra&lt;/ulink&gt; and anti-TNFalpha therapy, are capable of slowing bone and cartilage destruction when administered in combination with methotrexate. Nevertheless, most of these therapies are also associated with side effects, and some lack responses in certain subsets of patients. Therefore, other therapeutic options need to be explored, preferably those that demonstrate disease-modifying and antirheumatic properties.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Syk is critical in regulating the development of functional osteoclasts through DAP12 and FcR, and could also prevent bone destruction in patients with RA, an effect that occurs more frequently as the disease progresses. The efficacy of fostamatinib in the treatment of RA was demonstrated in a 12-week phase II clinical trial. Responses as early as 1 week after the initiation of treatment were demonstrated. This result suggests that fostamatinib has a rapid onset of action, similar to steroids. However, this rapidity was only observed in a subset of patients from the study. The potential of this therapy for the wider population remains to be determined. The ongoing trials for RA will hopefully provide better evidence on the effectiveness of fostamatinib within larger populations and for longer treatment periods; intra-patient response and efficacy should also be assessed in these larger trials.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In addition to reducing inflammation, Syk inhibition by R-406 or fostamatinib also prevents bone degradation by reducing the levels of cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-13 and TNFalpha in the synovium; treatment with R-406 resulted in a significant reduction in joint damage compared with the vehicle control. Syk inhibition also regulates cartilage damage by preventing the release of MMPs and caused suppression of inflammatory cell infiltration into the synovial fluid and tissue, and reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion into the joint space. Thus, Syk inhibition with R-406 or fostamatinib prevented disease progression in patients with RA because of its multifunctional roles in diverse cell types that control inflammation, tissue damage and bone destruction.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Furthermore, irrespective of its multiple beneficial roles and overlapping functions, Syk inhibitors do not appear to cause unwanted side effects as observed with other immunosuppressants, thus sparing the innate immunity and avoiding opportunistic infections. Syk inhibition by R-406 did not cause any dose-dependent immunotoxicity and did not affect the innate and humoral immune responses. Reports have suggested that redundant pathways allow macrophages and neutrophils to respond to bacterial pathogens in the absence of Syk. Nevertheless, the treatment of rats with R-406 resulted in immunomodulating effects, such as a decrease in thymic and spleen weight, hypocellularity of bone marrow and reduced lymphocyte count; upon discontinuation of treatment with the drug, rats recovered after a 14-day treatment-free period. Fostamatinib was also well tolerated when administered in combination with the widely used methotrexate. However, an increase in blood pressure was noted in patients receiving twice-daily doses of 150 mg of fostamatinib, and might be of concern for patients with RA who generally have a tendency to develop elevated blood pressure and require blood pressure medication along with RA therapy. Elevated blood pressure was reversed upon the discontinuation of fostamatinib; ongoing trials with reduced doses should further address this issue.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Despite being expressed in a wide variety of hematopoietic cells, Syk appears to play a minimal role in regulating functions such as vascular homeostasis and other housekeeping functions that have been presumed to be masked by redundant Syk-independent pathways. However, upon inhibition of Syk by R-406 or fostamatinib, the redundant pathways/enzymes that may be activated to regulate these functions have not been explored, and the long-term implications are unknown. In addition, no in vitro and ex vivo studies have addressed which pathways are involved in regulating immunoreceptor-mediated functions in the absence of Syk.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In patients with ITP, existing therapies have significant side effects and often lack long-term effectiveness, and sustained remissions are infrequent. Thus, improved novel therapies are necessary. When Syk is inhibited by R-406 or fostamatinib, the immune cell function is interrupted and platelets can escape destruction. Preclinical and early clinical data demonstrated that R-406 or fostamatinib may be useful in stopping platelet destruction and may provide therapeutic benefits in treating this rare autoimmune disorder. However, the exact mode of action has not been investigated in preclinical studies, and whether the prevention of ITP development is mediated through interference with anti-platelet antibody production or FcR signaling in cells of the reticulo-endothelial system is unknown. A complete signaling pathway with a mechanism of safeguarding platelets during treatment with fostamatinib needs to be explored. The phase II clinical trial in patients with ITP, although conducted in only a small group of patients, provided encouraging results; therapy with fostamatinib may be an alternative therapeutic option and allow patients to avoid unnecessary injections of IgGs or steroids. Platelet aggregation studies in healthy volunteers also showed no inhibition of collagen- or ADP-induced platelet functions, and no effect on bleeding times was observed in preclinical studies. Nevertheless, data are needed from larger trials, contingent on when Rigel (and a potential collaboration partner) initiates further trials.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Other possible treatment indications for fostamatinib are B-cell lymphomas and other NHL varieties for which Syk inhibition would prevent B-cell receptor-mediated signaling and thus the uncontrolled growth of lymphoma cells. Several treatment options for lymphoma exist, but prolonged survival rates are low and recurrence is common. The phase II clinical trial of fostamatinib for lymphoma demonstrated reasonable response rates in patients relapsed/refractory to previous treatments, including CHOP and possibly &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6736"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt;. Thus, modulating the B-cell-signaling pathway with fostamatinib may represent a new therapeutic approach for patients with NHL, particularly in DLBCL and SLL/CLL. As an oral agent that appears to be well tolerated, fostamatinib may become an attractive additional therapeutic option in these cancers.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Moreover, preclinical studies have indicated a potential use of fostamatinib for the treatment of SLE. SLE is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and subsequent swelling, pain, loss of function and ultimate destruction of affected organs, including kidneys, skin, joints, heart, lungs and brain [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="979218"&gt;979218&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A characteristic of SLE are activated T-cells that express FcRgamma following stimulation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="979219"&gt;979219&lt;/ulink&gt;]. An increased expression of Syk has been observed in SLE T-cells, and inhibition of Syk controlled abnormal T-cell responses in SLE [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="979219"&gt;979219&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Rigel had planned a phase II clinical trial for fostamatinib in patients with SLE but, at the time of publication, this trial was suspended until a partner for collaboration could be identified. The potential of fostamatinib as a therapeutic option for SLE thus remains to be determined.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Despite extensive in vitro and in vivo studies with R-406 and fostamatinib, some questions remain unanswered. For example, further research is required to determine whether the reduced clearance and extended half-life of antibodies in the CIA model were caused by Syk inhibition, or if these effects simply reflected the long half-life of IgGs, or were caused by a different mechanism. The effect in treating humans for long time periods also needs to be assessed. In addition, R-406 inhibits the proliferation of B-cells with deregulated Syk, but no evidence suggests that normal B-cells remain unaffected. Although the use of life-saving drugs even with minor side effects are important in patients with cancer, the implication of affecting the B-cell function in long-term treatment for patients with RA needs to be addressed.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Extensive in vitro assays have been undertaken to assess the potency of R-406 in numerous cell-based assays, and many receptors and stimulations were examined to determine the specificity and selectivity of the drug. However, among a list of more than 500 kinases, any other kinases inhibited by this drug have not been disclosed. Although it may not be feasible to demonstrate cell-based selectivity for all kinases, in vitro enzyme assay profiling would be sufficient to speculate on the possibility of side effects or a negligible role of other kinases in the Syk signaling pathway.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The clinical trials conducted to date with fostamatinib have been limited mainly to US locations; the advanced phase II trials in patients with RA are expected to be performed in the US, Europe and Latin America [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="915976"&gt;915976&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The effect of fostamatinib on the worldwide population needs to be explored. More placebo-controlled clinical trials in a wider population should be initiated to further demonstrate efficacy response rates and to determine the minimum effective dose for each indication studied. The required doses depending on the severity of disease also have not been described. In addition, the pharmacokinetic data for fostamatinib do not mention the tissue distribution of the drug nor the amount of time the drug remains in those tissues. Determining where the drug is distributed to or whether it remains mostly in the plasma would be useful.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Fostamatinib is safe in the short term, but the long-term implications remain unknown. All of the diseases discussed require long-term treatments, and meaningful results on the potential of fostamatinib will therefore require long timeframes, which could be the next step in the development of the drug. Although patients responded well in the early stages of treatment, responses may be less favorable in the later span of treatment, as occurs for many other therapies. In particular, antibody-based therapies become less effective over time by developing inhibitory antibodies directed against the active sites of the administered antibodies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="892126"&gt;892126&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, Syk inhibition by fostamatinib has been claimed to be associated with an added advantage of decreasing antibody clearance, thereby enhancing the half-life and efficacy of biological therapies, such as anti-TNFalpha and anti-CD20 antibodies. Ongoing and subsequent clinical trials should incorporate larger cohort groups (as per the phase II trials in patients with RA), and are expected to report on the clinical efficacy and potential dose-response effect of fostamatinib in the treatment of RA, ITP and B-cell lymphoma.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="25471">Rigel
