linkID="25258" linkType="Company"&gt;Genitope&lt;/ulink&gt; was developing the patient-specific active immunotherapy GTOP-99 (MyVax Personalized Immunotherapy), which is based on selecting from a panel of approximately 30 anti-idiotype antibodies one which reacts with the antibody produced by a B-cell tumor clone, for the potential treatment of indolent  B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL),  mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In December 2000, a phase III trial was underway in previously untreated indolent  B-cell NHL patients [&lt;ulink linkID="394312" linkType="reference"&gt;394312&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in November 2005, this was scheduled for completion in mid-2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="633137" linkType="Reference"&gt;633137&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2002, Genitope started a phase III trial of GTOP-99 following treatment with &lt;ulink linkID="6736" linkType="Drug"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; for patients previously treated for follicular NHL (fNHL) [&lt;ulink linkID="472839" linkType="Reference"&gt;472839&lt;/ulink&gt;].  By 2002, a phase II trial was also ongoing in patients with MCL and aggressive DLBCL [&lt;ulink linkID="475087" linkType="reference"&gt;475087&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="639708" linkType="Reference"&gt;639708&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In February 2006, Genitope began a US phase I/II trial in CLL [&lt;ulink linkID="652409" linkType="Reference"&gt;652409&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2008, the company suspended development of the drug following a meeting with the FDA.  At that time, Genitope was evaluating its options with regards to the program [&lt;ulink linkID="884757" linkType="Reference"&gt;884757&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however,  by  March 2009, the company was no longer trading and all research and development activities were presumed to have been discontinued [&lt;ulink linkID="1293679" linkType="Reference"&gt;1293679&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2008, Genitope suspended development of MyVax, following a meeting with the FDA which discussed the products failure to reach its primary endpoint in a pivotal phase III trial for fNHL. Following the review, the FDA stated that it would require at least one additional phase III trial before it would accept a MyVax BLA. Genitope determined that this was not feasible at this time. Genitope planned to refocus its resources on its &lt;ulink linkID="59647" linkType="Drug"&gt;monoclonal antibody program for NHL&lt;/ulink&gt;, while evaluating its alternatives in the MyVax program [&lt;ulink linkID="884757" linkType="Reference"&gt;884757&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2006, the vaccine was granted Fast Track status for follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (fNHL) by the FDA [&lt;ulink linkID="673347" linkType="Reference"&gt;673347&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Regulatory&gt;</value></Regulatory><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2006, Genitope began a phase I/II CLL trial in 70 treatment-naive patients with Rai stage 0, I and II disease, who would receive 16 MyVax injections over 1 year [&lt;ulink linkID="652409" linkType="Reference"&gt;652409&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2006, further information on the trial was reported. The multicenter study would assess the safety of the vaccine and its ability to stimulate antitumor immune responses that could eradicate or block the progression of leukemia [&lt;ulink linkID="666308" linkType="Reference"&gt;666308&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2000, a phase III trial was underway [&lt;ulink linkID="394312" linkType="reference"&gt;394312&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2004, Genitope expected to complete patient enrollment  by the end of that month [&lt;ulink linkID="526603" linkType="reference"&gt;526603&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2004, registration was closed  [&lt;ulink linkID="538503" linkType="reference"&gt;538503&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2004, the independent data safety monitoring board (IDSM) recommended that the trial, which was to compare the progression-free survival of those treated with GTOP-99 to those treated with control, continue as planned [&lt;ulink linkID="571396" linkType="Reference"&gt;571396&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2005, Genitope planned to begin an interim analysis of data from this trial in the second quarter of 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="589140" linkType="Reference"&gt;589140&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further recommendations from the IDSM that the trial continue were received in July 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="614087" linkType="Reference"&gt;614087&lt;/ulink&gt;] and July 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="680651" linkType="Reference"&gt;680651&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Data were reported in December 2007. In the double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, patients initially received chemotherapy, followed by a 6-month rest period. Patients who maintained a partial response were then treated with GTOP-99 or a non-specific immunotherapy control. The therapy failed to meet its primary endpoint of a significant difference in PFS between patients that received MyVax and control-treated patients. However, there was a significant difference in PFS between patients that did and did not have a positive immune response to the therapy [&lt;ulink linkID="862903" linkType="Reference"&gt;862903&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2002, clinical data were presented at the 44th ASH meeting in Philadelphia, PA. In a phase II study in 11 patients with fNHL receiving GM-CSF (500 microg) with GTOP-99, 45% of the patients demonstrated specific humoral response [&lt;ulink linkID="473466" linkType="reference"&gt;473466&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="473369" linkType="reference"&gt;473369&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase I/II study was initiated to assess the immunogenicity of these idiotype vaccines in patients with follicular NHL in first remission following chemotherapy. As of December 2000, 14 patients had been enrolled. The trial involved five sc administrations of the idiotype protein coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin on day 1, together with locally administered GM-CSF on days 1 to 4. Of ten evaluable patients, seven developed idiotype-specific immune responses (five humoral, five cellular proliferative, and three both). Humoral and cellular proliferative reactivity was observed against both recombinant and tumor hybridoma-derived idiotype proteins. Two patients showing persistent bcl-2 PCR signal in peripheral blood both converted to bcl-2 negative after immunization [&lt;ulink linkID="392810" linkType="reference"&gt;392810&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2005, at the 47th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA, further results were presented from the phase II study, which by that time had recruited 16 patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma; 13 of the subjects mounted an anti-idiotype immune response and 10 mounted a humoral anti-idiotype response, while seven mounted a cellular anti-idiotype response. Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate, and the therapy was generally well tolerated. At that time, the median time-to-disease-progression was 37.7 months; 10 patients, four of whom were classified as high-risk by FLIPI score, remained progression-free between 47 and 71 months post-chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="639900" linkType="Reference"&gt;639900&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In combination with rituximab&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2007, a phase II fNHL began.  The 100-patient, multicenter, single-arm US study would evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug. Subjects would receive 24 immunizations with MyVax for 92 weeks, following six to eight cycles of treatment with &lt;ulink linkID="6736" linkType="Drug"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; and chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="797219" linkType="Reference"&gt;797219&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The objective of the open-label phase III trial initiated in December 2002, was to evaluate the clinical benefit of GTOP-99 following treatment of patients with fNHL with &lt;ulink linkID="6736" linkType="Drug"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt;, as well as to evaluate whether a specific immune response to GTOP-99 could be obtained following use of ritixumab, as well as the safety and tolerability of these regimens. Upon enrollment in the 2002-09 trial, participants were to receive a course of rituximab. Patients who achieved at least a partial response to the rituximab infusions were to receive a series of immunizations of GTOP-99 [&lt;ulink linkID="472839" linkType="reference"&gt;472839&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;In the phase III study, the recombinant immunotherapy was to be studied in the treatment of patients who had completed their first course of chemotherapy. It was to be given generally after CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, or prednisone) or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, or prednisone). Patients must have shown at least a 50% reduction in their tumor burden before receiving the immunotherapy. It was not necessary for a patient to achieve a complete response to chemotherapy to receive the immunotherapy, but the patients must have their tumor burden reduced. A patient would receive 5 immunization series of Id immunotherapy in about 6 months. The treatment consisted of Id coupled to KLH (Id-KLH) and was to be given via sc injection (at two sites) once a month for 4 months, followed by a 12-week break and then the fifth and final immunization. In addition, GM-CSF was to be administered sc on the same day as the Id-KLH in the same two sites, followed GM-CSF alone once a day in both sites for 3 days following Id-KLH immunization [&lt;ulink linkID="394317" linkType="reference"&gt;394317&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2002, phase II data were presented at the 38th ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. Each patient received 5 doses of idiotype with KLH (Id-KLH) sc within a 24-week period. GM-CSF was also administered as an adjuvant. After 5 injections, 13 of 16 patients demonstrated tumor-specific immune responses [&lt;ulink linkID="451705" linkType="reference"&gt;451705&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Data from another study were also presented at the 38th ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. Tumor-specific variable regions of the clonal immunologlobulin (Id) expressed by B-cell NHL were used as a target for immunotherapy. Humoral and cellular anti-immunoglobulin responses were observed, which correlated to improved disease free and overall survival. Hi-Get was to process 480 specimens from patients with follicular NHL in a phase III trial [&lt;ulink linkID="452466" linkType="reference"&gt;452466&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2005, further clinical data from this study were presented at the 47th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA. GTOP-99 was well tolerated, with the two occurrences of grade 3 skin toxicity and eosinophilia judged likely to be related to the GM-CSF adjuvant rather than GTOP-99. There was an 81% overall idiotype-specific immune response rate: 56% antibody response and 44% T-cell proliferative response. Three patients showed both T-cell and antibody responses. At evaluation following five vaccinations, there was one partial response, one mixed response, eight incidences of stable disease, and six of progressive disease. After eight vaccinations, these figures had risen to two partial responses, three mixed responses and eleven with progressive disease [&lt;ulink linkID="639708" linkType="Reference"&gt;639708&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In late 2000, phase II trials were ongoing, at &lt;ulink linkID="20679" linkType="Company"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/ulink&gt; Medical Center and the &lt;ulink linkID="29004" linkType="Company"&gt;University of Nebraska Medical Center&lt;/ulink&gt;, for aggressive B-cell lymphoma and indolent B-cell lymphoma. According to the protocol the patient would first undergo a regimen of chemotherapy to reduce the tumor burden, followed by a rest period. During this time, Genitope would produce the patient-specific immunotherapy. After recovery, the immunotherapy would be administered as a series of injections, and the patient's immune response to the immunotherapy measured [&lt;ulink linkID="393267" linkType="reference"&gt;393267&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2003, results from this trial were presented at the 45th ASH meeting in San Diego, CA. Twenty seven  MCL or DLBCL patients received one of two immunization regimens. Patients received CHOP (Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone) followed by a 6- or 3.5-month recovery period, then 24 or 18 vaccinations. Schedule A (n=14 patients, including 5 with MCL) consisted of 5 immunizations administered over 24 weeks, starting 6 months after the completion of chemotherapy. The MCL patients progressed at a median of 254 days following the completion of chemotherapy. Schedule B was employed in 13 subjects (n=11 MCL), with vaccination beginning 13 weeks following completion of chemotherapy and continuing every 2 weeks for 7 doses (with an 8th dose at week 18 of vaccination). Median time to progression had not been reached at that time in those MCL subjects at a median follow-up of 522 days following completion of chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="516446" linkType="reference"&gt;516446&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were presented in December 2005, at the 47th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA.  The median time-to-progression for the MCL and DLBCL patients on Schedule A, was 254 and 442 days, respectively, while on Schedule B it was 477 and 274 days, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="639708" linkType="Reference"&gt;639708&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2007, preclinical data from experiments involving the cynomolgus antibodies Xi-20H5 and Xi-3C9 were presented at the 49th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA. .
