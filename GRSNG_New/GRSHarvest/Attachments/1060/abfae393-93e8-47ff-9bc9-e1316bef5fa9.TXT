In September  2011, data were presented at the 47th annual meeting of European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Lisbon, Portugal.  A significant reduction of body weight was demonstrated in the ipragliflozin-treated group (-1.47 kg compared with placebo). Target HbA1c levels of &amp;lt; 6.9% were achieved by 12.9% of patients in the ipragliflozin arm (n = 62) versus 1.5% in the placebo arm (n = 67); the mean change from baseline to week 16 in HbA1c with ipragliflozin was -0.76 percentage points. After ipragliflozin treatment, a significant net reduction in fasting plasma glucose levels of -45.8 mg/dl was observed. A reduction in body weight was -2.36 kg with ipragliflozin and was significant compared with -0.89 kg in the placebo group. In the ipragliflozin group, the mean change in systolic BP from baseline was -7 mmHg at week 12. At week 16, ipragliflozin resulted in a decrease of mean systolic BP and diastolic BP to -3.2 and -2.5 mmHg, respectively, from baseline. In the ipragliflozin group, significant but mild changes in RBC counts, hematocrit, hemoglobin and blood urea nitrogen levels were observed [&lt;ulink linkID="1219276" linkType="Reference"&gt;1219276&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1223282" linkType="Reference"&gt;1223282&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1223294" linkType="Reference"&gt;1223294&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1227315" linkType="Reference"&gt;1227315&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2011, a Japanese phase III multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study (&lt;ulink linkID="75583" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01316094&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1941-CL-0072) of ipragliflozin was initiated in T2DM patients (estimated n = 150) with renal impairment.

Ipragliflozin significantly reduced the body fat mass when compared with vehicle, at 9 weeks after treatment. Ipragliflozin (1 mg/kg ) caused a dose-dependent reduction in A1C and plasma insulin levels (4.2% and 1.96 ng/ml, respectively) compared with the vehicle (4.9% and 2.84 ng/ml, respectively), at 8 weeks after treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="1301018" linkType="Reference"&gt;1301018&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2012, preclinical data were presented at the ADA 72nd Scientific Sessions in Philadelphia, PA.

Ipragliflozin is a small-molecule inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 being developed by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1013295"&gt;Astellas Pharma&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17687"&gt;Kotobuki Pharmaceutical&lt;/ulink&gt; for the treatment of patients with T2DM. Inhibition of SGLT-2 decreases renal glucose reabsorption in the nephron, thus increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE) and decreasing elevated circulating glucose levels in patients with T2DM. Decreasing blood glucose levels by this approach has additional benefits of weight loss and avoidance of hypoglycemic events because of continued release of endogenous glucose by the liver. In mouse and rat models of diabetes, ipragliflozin dose-dependently increased UGE and significantly decreased glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. In clinical trials, ipragliflozin increased UGE in healthy individuals and also in individuals with T2DM. Treatment with ipragliflozin resulted in decreased fasting and postprandial glucose levels, and also decreased HbA1c levels in patients with T2DM, in addition to decreasing body weight. Evaluation of another SGLT-2 inhibitor, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15065"&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="14190"&gt;AstraZeneca&lt;/ulink&gt;), has raised safety concerns; however, it is unclear at this time whether these concerns are specific to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; or if they are general side effects of SGLT-2 inhibition. Although early results indicate that ipragliflozin is a potential candidate for the treatment of T2DM, additional phase II and III clinical trials must be completed and undergo peer-review to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of ipragliflozin.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Projections indicate that more than 439 million adults worldwide will have diabetes by 2030, ~ 1.5-fold the number estimated for 2010 (285 million adults) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265673"&gt;1265673&lt;/ulink&gt;] and ~ 2.5-fold the total number estimated for 2000 (171 million people) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="880516"&gt;880516&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This disease is characterized by disturbed glucose regulation caused by decreased insulin secretion and/or decreased insulin sensitivity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257093"&gt;1257093&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a condition in which decreased insulin sensitivity often progresses to a combination of insulin resistance and beta-cell failure [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254766"&gt;1254766&lt;/ulink&gt;], accounts for ~ 90% of all diabetes cases [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254754"&gt;1254754&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254756"&gt;1254756&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Over the past decade, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which provide a long-term indicator of blood glucose levels, have improved on average in individuals with diabetes in the US, possibly in part the result of earlier diagnosis; however, ~ 40% of individuals diagnosed with diabetes continue to have HbA1c levels of &amp;gt; 7%, which is regarded as inadequate glycemic control [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="996031"&gt;996031&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These elevated blood glucose levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetic complications, including cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254755"&gt;1254755&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Novel T2DM treatments are necessary to improve glycemic control, thus avoiding debilitating complications.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Current oral mono- or combination therapies for T2DM are largely based on the physiological mechanisms of increasing insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity. These therapies, as well as insulin injections, increase the risk of weight gain and hypoglycemic events; therefore, other physiological targets are currently being investigated, including renal glucose excretion. In healthy individuals, &amp;gt; 99% of blood glucose entering the glomerular capsule (~ 180 g of glucose per day) is filtered into the nephron, almost all of which is completely reabsorbed [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1048572"&gt;1048572&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257103"&gt;1257103&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, when blood glucose levels are elevated above 11 mM, such as in individuals with diabetes, the nephron losses the ability to completely reabsorb glucose, inducing glycosuria [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254770"&gt;1254770&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Approximately 90% of renal glucose reabsorption occurs in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule, the predominant site of sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 expression [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254773"&gt;1254773&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257103"&gt;1257103&lt;/ulink&gt;]. SGLT-2 has a low glucose affinity (apparent affinity constant [K0.5] = 5 mM), but a high glucose transport capacity, which contrasts the high glucose affinity (K0.5 = 0.5 mM) and lower glucose transport capacity of SGLT-1, which is largely responsible for the remaining 10% of glucose reabsorption in the straight segment of the descending proximal tubule [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1048572"&gt;1048572&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254764"&gt;1254764&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254773"&gt;1254773&lt;/ulink&gt;]. SGLT-2 transports glucose and sodium in a 1:1 ratio across the luminal surface of the brush border epithelial cells of the proximal tubule [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1048572"&gt;1048572&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257103"&gt;1257103&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Transport of glucose into the cell, against its concentration gradient, is driven by an inward intracellular sodium electrochemical gradient. The sodium gradient is maintained by the sodium-potassium ATPase on the basolateral surface, pumping sodium from the intracellular to intercellular fluid. Once glucose is transported from the lumen into the epithelial cell, it diffuses into the blood through glucose transporter 2 (GLUT-2; also known as facilitated glucose transporter) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254761"&gt;1254761&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Inhibiting the process of renal glucose reabsorption, and thus decreasing circulating glucose levels, was first identified as a potential target for T2DM treatment when it was determined that glycosuria could be induced by administration of phlorizin, a compound first isolated from the bark of apple trees in 1835 for the treatment of fevers, infectious diseases and malaria [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254753"&gt;1254753&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254772"&gt;1254772&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The pharmaceutical potential of phlorizin was invigorated in the 1980s and 1990s by the identification of SGLT-1 and SGLT-2, and evidence that phlorizin induces glycosuria by competitive inhibition of glucose binding to both cotransporters [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254764"&gt;1254764&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254772"&gt;1254772&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254773"&gt;1254773&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Phlorizin normalizes plasma glucose levels in 90% of pancreatectomized rats by increasing glycosuria [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1048574"&gt;1048574&lt;/ulink&gt;], but is not optimal for the clinical treatment of T2DM. Phlorizin is poorly absorbed in the intestine, has undetermined toxicity, and its inhibition of both SGLT-1 and SGLT-2 causes osmotic diarrhea resulting from blockade of the normal activity of SGLT-1 in glucose absorption in the intestine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254764"&gt;1254764&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254772"&gt;1254772&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257103"&gt;1257103&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Although phlorizin is not appropriate for the treatment of T2DM in humans, selective inhibition of SGLT-2 to induce glycosuria, and ultimately decrease circulating glucose levels, does have many advantages over other current diabetes therapies. Specific dose-dependent inhibition of SGLT-2 induces glycosuria in healthy individuals, without inducing an increased risk of hypoglycemia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1007588"&gt;1007588&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Indeed, individuals with familial renal glycosuria, which is associated with mutations in the SLC5 gene encoding SGLT-2, exhibit glycosuria but maintain normal serum glucose levels [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265678"&gt;1265678&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This suggests that inhibition of SGLT-2 does not simply lower the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption, but also induces glucose excretion across the physiological range of circulating glucose levels [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254757"&gt;1254757&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The lack of an increase in hypoglycemic events, also observed with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; and thiazolidinediones, is especially advantageous, as this is a common adverse event experienced with other single agent and combination treatments that increase insulin levels or insulin sensitivity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257116"&gt;1257116&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although the exact physiological mechanism has not been determined, sustained plasma glucose levels in healthy individuals treated with a SLGT-2 inhibitor suggests that the liver is increasing endogenous glucose output, which may have interesting, but yet unclear, physiological implications for hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254757"&gt;1254757&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Many current diabetes treatments result in long-term weight gain [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257116"&gt;1257116&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, when renal glucose reabsorption is inhibited and euglycemic levels are maintained by endogenous glucose production, 30 to 80 g of glucose (translating to 120 to 320 kcal) are excreted over 24 h [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254757"&gt;1254757&lt;/ulink&gt;]. If this rate of excretion is sustained, theoretically, it would result in a 6 to 16 kg decrease in weight over the course of a year, although it is likely that compensatory mechanisms may limit actual weight loss [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254757"&gt;1254757&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Further promise for the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors for the treatment of T2DM is found when evaluating SGLT-2 expression in human proximal tubular epithelial cells obtained from the urine of healthy individuals and those with T2DM. Both SGLT-2 and GLUT-2 expression are significantly increased in individuals with T2DM compared with healthy individuals [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1208672"&gt;1208672&lt;/ulink&gt;]. While this is likely to be a compensatory mechanism that occurs during the development of T2DM, it does indicate that SGLT-2 inhibition may be particularly effective in this population. This is supported by initial clinical trials in patients with T2DM that indicate inhibition of SGLT-2 decreases HbA1c, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116896"&gt;1116896&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The therapeutic potential of SGLT-2 inhibition for the treatment of T2DM has resulted in the development of several specific small-molecule SGLT-2 inhibitors. These compounds include: &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15065"&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="14190"&gt;AstraZeneca&lt;/ulink&gt;), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="57592"&gt;canagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17332"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1035060"&gt;Mitsubishi Tanabe&lt;/ulink&gt;), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="58762"&gt;empagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="22546"&gt;Boehringer Ingelheim&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17810"&gt;Eli Lilly&lt;/ulink&gt;), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="63431"&gt;luseogliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20289"&gt;Taisho Pharmaceutical&lt;/ulink&gt;), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="58551"&gt;tofogliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15414"&gt;Chugai Pharmaceutical&lt;/ulink&gt;) and ipragliflozin (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1013295"&gt;Astellas Pharma&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17687"&gt;Kotobuki Pharmaceutical&lt;/ulink&gt;). All of these compounds are based on the phlorizin structure and have entered phase III clinical trials for T2DM (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="65219"&gt;NCT01095666&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="64006"&gt;NCT01064414&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="74465"&gt;NCT01289990&lt;/ulink&gt;, JapicCTI-111661, JapicCTI-101351 and &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="83798"&gt;NCT01505426&lt;/ulink&gt;, respectively). &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;Dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="57592"&gt;canagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="58762"&gt;empagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; and ipragliflozin retain the glucose moiety of phlorizin that binds to the active site of the SGLTs; however, the 'O'-linked phenolic distal ring responsible for its inhibitory properties has been replaced by C-glucoside linkage to distal rings with lipophilic groups that resist hydrolysis by beta-glucosidase and increase selectivity to SGLT-2 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257103"&gt;1257103&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a similar fashion, the 'O'-linked phenolic distal ring has also been replaced by a C-glucoside linkage in &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="63431"&gt;luseogliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt;, but the glucose structure has been replaced by a thiacyclohexane ring [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1224428"&gt;1224428&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="58551"&gt;tofogliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt;, the glucose moiety is retained, but it has a spiroisobenzofuran group at the 2-position [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1108977"&gt;1108977&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Oral administration of these compounds provides an added advantage in predicted compliance.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;To date, the most extensively researched SGLT-2 inhibitor is &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt;. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;Dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment induces glycosuria in a dose-dependent manner in healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1007584"&gt;1007584&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1007588"&gt;1007588&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Individuals with T2DM treated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; have improved blood glucose and HbA1c levels [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1007584"&gt;1007584&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116896"&gt;1116896&lt;/ulink&gt;]. After completion of phase III clinical trials, an application was submitted to begin the process for approval for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; for use in the treatment of T2DM in the US and EU; however, concerns regarding safety, including increased risk of bladder cancer, breast cancer and hepatic events, have delayed approval pending further evaluation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257100"&gt;1257100&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether the adverse events associated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; were the result of SGLT-2 inhibition or were specific to this molecular compound. It was also uncertain if further trials would provide evidence supporting approval.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Despite concerns regarding &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt;, development of other SGLT-2 small molecule inhibitors has continued. As mentioned previously, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="57592"&gt;canagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="58762"&gt;empagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; and ipragliflozin have completed phase II clinical trials and are undergoing and/or have completed phase III trials. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="57592"&gt;Canagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; increased glucose excretion in a dose-dependent manner in healthy individuals and decreased circulating glucose levels in a diabetic mouse model [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1130982"&gt;1130982&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254279"&gt;1254279&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="58762"&gt;Empagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; improved glycemic control in rats when dosed in combination with insulin [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1259633"&gt;1259633&lt;/ulink&gt;] and increased urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in phase I trials in patients with T2DM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109389"&gt;1109389&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109454"&gt;1109454&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, the results of the clinical trials for these compounds have not been subjected to peer-review.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Ipragliflozin has shown promise as a SGLT-2 inhibitor for the treatment of T2DM in phase II and III trials. The remainder of this review is dedicated to the summary and critique of these findings.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Research into inhibitors of SGLT-2 resulted in a series of C-glucoside derivatives, including ipragliflozin [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1174440"&gt;1174440&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In one published synthesis, ipragliflozin ((1S)-1,5-anhydro-1-C-[3-(1-benzothien-2-ylmethyl)-4-fluorophenyl]-D-glucitol) was generated following the debenzylation of (1S)-1,5-anhydro-1-[3-(1-benzothienylmethyl)-4-fluorophenyl)-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-D-glucitol. The starting tetra-O-benzyl-D-glucitol was prepared by first treating benzo[b]thiophene in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with n-butyl lithium in hexane, and then coupling with 5-bromo-2-fluorobenzaldehyde in THF (-78degC) to generate 1-benzothienyl-(5-bromo-2-fluorophenyl)methanol. The alcohol group was protected by the addition of tetra-butyl dimethylchlorosilane in the presence of imidazole and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine in dimethylformamide (DMF) to provide [1-benzothien-2-yl-(5-bromo-2-fluorophenyl)methoxy](tert-butyl)dimethyl silane. The silyl ether was then treated with n-butyl lithium in hexane and THF and coupled with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzylgluconolactone in THF (-78degC), resulting in 1-C-[3-(1-benzothien-2-yl{tert-butyl-dimethylsilyloxy}methyl)-4-fluorophenyl]-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-D-glucopyranose. The silyloxy protecting group was then removed with tetra-butyl ammonium fluoride in THF to generate the 1-C-[3-(1-benzothien-2-yl{hydroxy}methyl)-4-fluorophenyl]-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-D-glucopyranose. Removal of the alcohol was affected by reacting the product from the previous step in acetonitrile with trimethyl silane and a complex of boron trifluoride and diethyl ether (-20degC), resulting in the starting (1S)-1,5-anhydro-1-[3-(1-benzothienylmethyl)-4-fluorophenyl)-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-D-glucitol. This product was debenzylated with boron trichloride in the presence of pentamethyl benzene in n-heptane and dichloromethane (-78degC) to generate ipragliflozin [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3203013"&gt;US-07202350&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3522430"&gt;US-07772407&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3794550"&gt;US-07977466&lt;/ulink&gt;]. An alternative synthesis is published in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA5567559"&gt;US-20100094025&lt;/ulink&gt;.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vitro&lt;/subtitle&gt;Ipragliflozin (&amp;lt;/= 3 microM) did not inhibit GLUT-mediated transport in the hepatic cell line HepG2 and the intestinal cell line Caco2. Ipragliflozin is substantially more selective for human SGLT-2 than human SGLT-1 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109384"&gt;1109384&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a comparative study of ipragliflozin, phlorizin and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt;, the inhibition of SGLT-1 and SGLT-2 derived from different species (humans, rats and mice) were compared. Against SGLT-2, ipragliflozin exhibited IC50 values of 7.38, 6.73 and 5.64 nM for the three respective species, compared with 34.6, 49.7 and 72.6 nM for phlorizin. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;Dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; exhibited IC50 values of 1.30 and 5.12 nM for human- and mouse-derived SGLT-2, respectively (no value against rat SGLT-2 was provided). Against SGLT-1, ipragliflozin exhibited IC50 values of 1876, 1166 and 1380 nM for the three respective species, compared with 210, 170 and 299 nM for phlorizin. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;Dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; exhibited IC50 values of 611 and 244 nM for human- and mouse-derived SGLT-1, respectively (again, no value against rat SGLT-1 was provided). In radio-ligand binding and enzyme assays, ipragliflozin demonstrated no activity (IC50 &amp;gt; 3000 nM) against various receptors (eg, adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, neurokinin, serotonin and histamine), ion channels (eg, calcium, sodium and potassium channels) and transporters (eg, dopamine and serotonin transporters) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1260641"&gt;1260641&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vivo&lt;/subtitle&gt;In normal mice, treatment with ipragliflozin (0.03 to 100 mg/kg po) dose-dependently reduced blood glucose levels in both fasted and glucose-loaded mice, which was significant at doses &gt;/= 0.1 and &gt;/= 10 mg/kg, respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.05 versus vehicle). In the fasted mice, plasma insulin levels were unaffected by treatment, while in the glucose-loaded mice plasma insulin levels were significantly lower for ipragliflozin-treated mice than for vehicle-treated controls [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1260641"&gt;1260641&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Single-dose oral administration of ipragliflozin (0.01 to 10 mg/kg) increased UGE in a dose-dependent manner in both normal and KK-A(y) mice (a model of T2DM) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109384"&gt;1109384&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1260641"&gt;1260641&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In KK-A(y) mice and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats (a model of T1DM), a single dose of ipragliflozin (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg) reduced hyperglycemia, without interfering with glucose absorption; hyperglycemia reduction was significant in STZ-induced diabetic rats at doses &gt;/= 0.3 mg/kg and for all doses in KK-A(y) mice (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Gains in UGE were positively correlated with baseline glucose levels [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109384"&gt;1109384&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1260641"&gt;1260641&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Administration of ipragliflozin (0.3 or 1 mg/kg po, qd) for 30 days to KK-A(y) mice resulted in significantly lower HbA1c levels (6.9 and 5.94% for 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively), compared with vehicle-treated controls (8.6%; p &amp;lt; 0.05). Urinary albumin excretion (a biomarker for diabetic nephropathy) was also significantly reduced (739 and 559 microg/day, respectively) versus controls (1250 microg/day; p &amp;lt; 0.05) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1108882"&gt;1108882&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1260641"&gt;1260641&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, only the highest dose resulted in significantly reduced blood glucose (346 mg/dl versus 470 mg/dl for controls; p &amp;lt; 0.05) and increased UGE (792 mg/day versus 464 mg/day for controls; p &amp;lt; 0.05) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1260641"&gt;1260641&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In db/db mice (a model of T2DM), ipragliflozin (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg qd) administered for 28 days improved HbA1c levels in a dose-dependent manner (6.3% at 0.1 mg/kg, compared with 7.1% for vehicle-treated controls) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1108882"&gt;1108882&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the 1-mg/kg ipragliflozin dose, pancreatic insulin content was increased and markers of islet degeneration were improved. In KK-A(y) mice, a greater decrease in HbA1c levels was observed after 28 days of treatment in mice administered ipragliflozin (0.3 mg/kg qd) in combination with the insulin-sensitizer &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; (100 mg/kg bid; HbA1c = 6.1%) or the thiazolidinedione &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4126"&gt;pioglitazone&lt;/ulink&gt; (10 mg/kg qd; HbA1c = 6.3%) compared with mice administered &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; (HbA1c = 7.8%) or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4126"&gt;pioglitazone&lt;/ulink&gt; alone (HbA1c = 7.3%) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1108882"&gt;1108882&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Significant reductions in HbA1c levels were observed following multiple-dose administration of ipragliflozin (0.3 or 1 mg/kg po, qd for 28 days) to STZ-induced diabetic rats: HbA1c levels were 8.5 and 7.6% for the two respective doses, compared with 10.6% for vehicle-treated controls (p &amp;lt; 0.05) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1260641"&gt;1260641&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Blood glucose was also significantly decreased (425 and 318 mg/dl for the two respective doses; p &amp;lt; 0.05) compared with vehicle (517 mg/dl). Increase in UGE was significant only at the higher dose of ipragliflozin (3630 mg/day compared with 2220 mg/day for vehicle-treated rats; p &amp;lt; 0.05). Pancreatic insulin content was also increased significantly at the higher dose (29.9 ng/mg tissue versus 15.8 ng/mg tissue for vehicle-treated controls; p &amp;lt; 0.05), likely because of the decreased circulating glucose levels [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1260641"&gt;1260641&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In diet-induced obese rats treated with ipragliflozin (1 to 10 mg/kg qd) for 28 days, increase in body weight was suppressed by &amp;gt; 30% (70.9 g increase compared with 109.3 g in vehicle-treated controls) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1201547"&gt;1201547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Both subcutaneous and visceral fat levels were significantly reduced in rats treated with ipragliflozin at 10 mg/kg (78 and 74.8%, respectively, compared with vehicle-treated mice; p &amp;lt; 0.05). Heat production rate using glucose as the energy source was reduced relative to vehicle-treated mice (6.5 versus 27.6 cal/min), while fat-generated heat production rate was increased compared with controls (35.6 versus 18.2 cal/min) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1201547"&gt;1201547&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;During preclinical studies, ipragliflozin did not induce hypoglycemia in non-diabetic mice. Furthermore, the dose causing reduction in fasting glucose in normal mice (&gt;/= 10 mg/kg) was ~ 100-fold higher than the effective dose in diabetic mice (&gt;/= 0.1 mg/kg), indicating a possible reduced risk of hypoglycemia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109384"&gt;1109384&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Following analysis of the effect of ipragliflozin (0.3 to 30 mg/kg) on gastrointestinal carbohydrate content of normal mice, treatment with ipragliflozin had no significant effect on gastrointestinal disaccharide and fructose content, although gastrointestinal glucose was significantly increased at the highest dose [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1260641"&gt;1260641&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The lack of interference with intestinal glucose absorption suggested a reduced risk of abdominal side effects. Lean body mass was unaffected by ipragliflozin treatment in diet-induced obese rats [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1201547"&gt;1201547&lt;/ulink&gt;], STZ-induced diabetic rats and KK-A(y) mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1108882"&gt;1108882&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1260641"&gt;1260641&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the normal mice treated with a single oral dose of ipragliflozin (0.01 to 10 mg/kg), urine volume was significantly increased at higher doses (3 and 10 mg/kg; p &amp;lt; 0.05 compared with vehicle).

Tmax was 1 to 1.5 h for the single dose and 1 to 2.3 h for multiple dosing, and t1/2 was ~ 12 h for a single dose, which was maintained after dosing for 10 days. At all doses, ~ 1% of ipragliflozin was excreted unchanged in urine. For the 10-day multiple dosing, AUC increased dose-dependently (328 to 46,501 ng.h/ml) with no apparent drug accumulation. Cmax also increased dose-dependently, and ranged from 75.4 ng/ml at the lowest dose to 6431 ng/ml at the highest dose after multiple dosing. Clearance from plasma was ~ 14 l/h after single and multiple doses. No pharmacokinetic differences based on gender were identified [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109368"&gt;1109368&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254280"&gt;1254280&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a further phase I clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="66335"&gt;NCT01121198&lt;/ulink&gt;), healthy male Japanese volunteers were administered either a single dose of ipragliflozin (1, 3, 10, 30, 100 or 300 mg po; n = 36) in a fasted state or ipragliflozin (20, 50 or 100 mg po, qd) for 7 days in a fed state [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109342"&gt;1109342&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265841"&gt;1265841&lt;/ulink&gt;]. For the single-dose arm, an additional group of volunteers received ipragliflozin (100 mg po) in a fed state. Cmax was 17.9 to 3421 ng/ml across all dose groups in the single-dose arm, while AUCinfinity was 58.9 to 27,299 ng.h/ml. Tmax and t1/2 were 0.8 to 2.6 h and 4.3 to 16.8 h, respectively. Apparent clearance was 10.5 to 17.4 l/h and renal clearance was 0.09 to 0.13 l/h. The proportion of ipragliflozin dose excreted into urine over 24 h after dosing was 0.65 to 1.18%. No significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between patients in the 100-mg fed and fasted groups. For the multiple-dose arm, Cmax was 398 to 1732 ng/ml across the three dose groups, while AUCinfinity was 1894 to 9114 ng.h/ml. Tmax and t1/2 were 1.3 to 1.4 h and 11.2 to 15.4 h, respectively. Apparent clearance was 10.8 to 11.2 l/h and renal clearance was 0.14 to 0.15 l/h.

The apparent clearance from plasma was independent of dose (typically 12.3 l/h), while the exposure (AUCtau) was dose-dependent. Modeling indicated that pharmacokinetic properties of ipragliflozin were comparable for both healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM, although there were slight increases in clearance and central distribution volume with increased volunteer/patient height, and clearance was lower in elderly participants [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1164550"&gt;1164550&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In pooled data from five trials involving healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM, results from 183 healthy young male volunteers indicated that AUC was 1715 ng.h/ml at the time of maximum drug effect (UGE over 24 h [UGE24] = 57 g; see 'Clinical development' section) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1164552"&gt;1164552&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4126"&gt;pioglitazone&lt;/ulink&gt; and ipragliflozin has been investigated in a phase I randomized, crossover-assignment, open-label clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="64954"&gt;NCT01088919&lt;/ulink&gt;) in healthy volunteers (n = 64).

The drug combinations had negligible effect on the overall systemic exposure of either drug, and pharmacokinetics were unchanged [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1229841"&gt;1229841&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a similar phase I randomized, crossover-assignment, open-label trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="65709"&gt;NCT01104532&lt;/ulink&gt;) investigating potential interactions between ipragliflozin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44499"&gt;sitagliptin&lt;/ulink&gt;, healthy volunteers (n = 64) were administered multiple doses of ipragliflozin (150 mg po, qd for 7 days) in combination with a single dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44499"&gt;sitagliptin&lt;/ulink&gt; (100 mg po), or a single dose of ipragliflozin (150 mg po) administered in combination with multiple doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44499"&gt;sitagliptin&lt;/ulink&gt; (100 mg po, qd for 7 days).

Intestinal alpha-glucosidase inhibitor &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3629"&gt;miglitol&lt;/ulink&gt; is used to delay absorption of complex carbohydrates in the diet and can be absorbed by SGLT-1 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1271008"&gt;1271008&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This agent was combined with ipragliflozin in a randomized, three-way crossover assignment, open-label trial &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="65389"&gt;NCT01099839&lt;/ulink&gt;. Healthy male Japanese volunteers (n = 30) were administered a single dose of ipragliflozin (100 mg po) or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3629"&gt;miglitol&lt;/ulink&gt; (75 mg po), or both, with a 6-day washout period between doses. The geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for Cmax and AUCinfinity for ipragliflozin with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3629"&gt;miglitol&lt;/ulink&gt; versus without were 1.034 and 1.015, respectively. GMRs for Cmax and AUCinfinity for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3629"&gt;miglitol&lt;/ulink&gt; with ipragliflozin versus without were 0.761 and 0.796, respectively. These results suggest a lack of drug-drug interaction between the two agents; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3629"&gt;miglitol&lt;/ulink&gt; absorption and exposure were decreased when administered in combination with ipragliflozin compared with alone, although this was not considered to be clinically relevant [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1271008"&gt;1271008&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8832"&gt;glimepiride&lt;/ulink&gt; was evaluated with ipragliflozin in crossover assignment, open-label trial &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="75169"&gt;NCT01302158&lt;/ulink&gt;.

The GMRs for Cmax and AUCinfinity for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8832"&gt;glimepiride&lt;/ulink&gt; with ipragliflozin versus without were 1.100 and 1.051, respectively. The formation of the 5-hydroxyglimepiride metabolite was also analyzed; GMRs for Cmax and AUCinfinity for the metabolite were 1.008 and 0.998, respectively. GMRs for Cmax and AUCinfinity for ipragliflozin with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8832"&gt;glimepiride&lt;/ulink&gt; versus without were 0.991 and 0.973, respectively. As with the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="65389"&gt;NCT01099839&lt;/ulink&gt; trial, these results suggest a lack of drug-drug interaction between the two agents [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1269608"&gt;1269608&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase I clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="75168"&gt;NCT01302145&lt;/ulink&gt;) has been conducted to assess the safety of combined administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; and ipragliflozin in patients (n = 36) with T2DM.

A significant and dose-dependent increase was observed in UGE over 24 h, increasing from 3.15 g in the 5-mg dose male group to 58.91 g in the 600-mg male group; UGE24 in the placebo group (males and females) was 0.11 g. UGE24 did not appear to be affected by gender; it was 40.00 and 34.77 g in males and females, respectively, treated at the 100-mg dose [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254280"&gt;1254280&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="66335"&gt;NCT01121198&lt;/ulink&gt; (1941-CL-0101), a phase I, randomized, parallel-group-assignment, single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, investigated the effect of single- and repeated-dose ipragliflozin in healthy male Japanese volunteers (n = 96). Participants received either a single dose of ipragliflozin (1, 3, 10, 30, 100 or 300 mg po; n = 36) or placebo (n = 12) administered in a fasted state, or ipragliflozin (20, 50 or 100 mg po, qd) or placebo administered after a meal for 7 days. The maximum UGE24 was observed at the 300-mg ipragliflozin dose in the single-dose arm (UGE24 = 70 g), and at the 50- and 100-mg doses in the multiple-dose arm (UGE24 = 50 g) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109342"&gt;1109342&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265841"&gt;1265841&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In data pooled from five clinical trials conducted across Japan, Europe and the US, enrolling healthy volunteers (n = 183) and also patients (n = 61) with T2DM receiving ipragliflozin (0.1 to 600 mg; frequency and route not specified), UGE24 was 1.9-fold greater in patients with T2DM than in healthy volunteers (107 versus 57 g, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1164552"&gt;1164552&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Japanese male patients with T2DM (n = 30) who were drug-naive or who had discontinued the use of an oral glucose-lowering drug were enrolled in a phase I, randomized, parallel-group-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="62341"&gt;NCT01023945&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1941-CL-0070) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1201952"&gt;1201952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients received ipragliflozin (50 or 100 mg) or placebo for 14 days. Fasting plasma glucose levels decreased from baseline in the 50- and 100-mg dose groups (-31.6 and -35.8 mg/dl, respectively); placebo was largely unaffected (+0.3 mg/dl). Similarly, in the 50- and 100-mg dose groups, decreases from baseline were also observed in postprandial plasma glucose (AUC0-3 h; -171.6 and -174.6 h.mg/dl, respectively) and all-day plasma glucose (AUC0-24 h; -1103.7 and -919.9 h.mg/dl, respectively); again, placebo was largely unaffected (+2.3 and +63.8 h.mg/dl for the respective measures). UGE24 increased by 5.3 g in the placebo group, compared with increases of 80.6 and 89.7 g in the two respective ipragliflozin groups. There was an overall decrease in body weight in the 50- and 100-mg ipragliflozin groups of 1.5 and 1.2 kg, respectively, compared with a decrease of 0.2 kg in the placebo group [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1201952"&gt;1201952&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase I, randomized, parallel-group-assignment, double-blind clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="75168"&gt;NCT01302145&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1941-CL-0056; 2007-005614-39) has been conducted to assess a combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; and ipragliflozin in patients (n = 36) with T2DM. As previously described (see the 'Metabolism and pharmacokinetics' section), patients already receiving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; (850, 1000 or 1500 mg po, bid) were administered ipragliflozin (300 mg po, qd) or placebo for 14 days. UGE24 was higher in patients receiving the combination treatment (UGE24 at day 14 = 74.9 +/- 31.5 g) compared with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; plus placebo (UGE24 at day 14 = 3.56 +/- 4.0 g) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1220119"&gt;1220119&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The effects of different grades of renal impairment on treatment with ipragliflozin were investigated in two phase I, parallel-assignment, open-label clinical trials. One of these trials (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="65301"&gt;NCT01097681&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1941-CL-0073), a non-randomized trial conducted in Japan, enrolled patients (n = 25) with T2DM and normal renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &gt;/= 90 ml/min/1.73 m2), or mild or moderate renal impairment (GFR = 60 to 89 and 30 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1220547"&gt;1220547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients received a single dose of ipragliflozin (50 mg po). There was an overall increase in mean daily UGE for all groups, although this was lower for patients with moderate renal impairment. After 24 h, mean decrease in plasma glucose from baseline was 24.9, 11.9 and 4.1 mg/dl for patients with normal, or mildly or moderately impaired renal function, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1220547"&gt;1220547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A randomized clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="75167"&gt;NCT01302028&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1941-CL-0064; 2009-011320-61) conducted in Europe investigated a single dose of ipragliflozin (100 mg po) in healthy volunteers (n = 8), patients with T2DM and normal renal function (GFR &gt;/= 90 ml/min/1.73 m2; n = 8) and patients with T2DM with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment (GFR = 60 to 89, 30 to 59 and 15 to 29 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively; n = 8 per group) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1202215"&gt;1202215&lt;/ulink&gt;]. UGE over 20 h was lower in patients with T2DM and moderate or severe renal impairment (UGE20 = 124 and 67 mmol, respectively) compared with healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM with normal renal function (UGE20 = 243 and 271 mmol, respectively), but was greater in patients with T2DM and mild renal impairment (UGE20 = 361 mmol); however, this group had a greater baseline UGE20 than the other groups [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1202215"&gt;1202215&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An additional phase I, randomized, parallel-group-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial has been completed. &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="78142"&gt;NCT01373060&lt;/ulink&gt; (1941-CL-2001) investigated the effect of single-dose ipragliflozin (no dose specified) in healthy male Taiwanese volunteers (n = 56). No results were available at the time of publication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;A phase II, randomized, parallel-group-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 28-day clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="35705"&gt;NCT00790660&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1941-CL-0016) was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ipragliflozin (50, 100, 200 or 300 mg, qd) in patients (n = 61) with T2DM. Patients were drug-naive or had participated in a 2-week washout period if previously prescribed monotherapy or low-dose combination therapies. Patients maintained a standardized, weight-maintenance diet [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109371"&gt;1109371&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254275"&gt;1254275&lt;/ulink&gt;]. UGE increased in a dose-dependent manner when adjusted from baseline after the first dose and remained above baseline to day 28, with UGE24 of ~ 500 mmol at the 300-mg dose. HbA1c was decreased at all doses (by 0.61 to 0.84%) versus baseline, although it is worth noting the HbA1c represents circulating glucose levels for ~ 2 to 3 months, the average lifespan of an erythrocyte (for a review see [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1271943"&gt;1271943&lt;/ulink&gt;]); therefore, results after 28 days should be interpreted with caution. Fasting plasma glucose was also decreased relative to baseline (by 2.72 to 3.92 mmol/l) in all ipragliflozin-treated groups. In the placebo group, HbA1c decreased by 0.10% relative to baseline and fasting plasma glucose decreased by 0.58 mmol/l. Compared with baseline, mean body weight decreased in all groups, with greater decreases after 28 days with ipragliflozin treatment (3.0 to 3.8 kg) than with placebo (1.6 kg). Significant decreases in fasting serum fructosamine (glycated serum proteins) were observed in the 100-, 200- and 300-mg dose groups (decrease of 0.053 to 0.063 mM; p &amp;lt; 0.02), and also in insulin levels in the 300-mg dose group (decrease of 51.10 pM; p = 0.033) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254275"&gt;1254275&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase II, randomized, parallel-group-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="7987"&gt;NCT00621868&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1941-CL-0103) was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109342"&gt;1109342&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Japanese patients (n = 361) with T2DM (mean baseline HbA1c ~ 8.0%) received ipragliflozin (12.5, 25, 50 or 100 mg po, qd) or placebo. HbA1c decreased in a dose-dependent manner, with the greatest reduction achieved at the 50-mg dose (reduction of 0.8 +/- 0.6% at 50 mg, compared with an increase of 0.5 +/- 1.0% for placebo; p &amp;lt; 0.001). The reduction in HbA1c was similar between non-obese and obese patients, and was more substantial in patients with baseline HbA1c &gt;/= 8.0% compared with patients with baseline HbA1c &amp;lt; 8.0%. In a subset of drug-naive patients, HbA1c decreased by ~ 0.9% in the 50- and 100-mg ipragliflozin groups, while increasing by ~ 0.1% in the placebo group. After 12 weeks of treatment with ipragliflozin, there was a dose-dependent decrease in body weight (p &amp;lt; 0.001), with no difference between non-obese and obese patients. The 100-mg dose group had a body weight reduction of ~ 2 kg, and a 0.8 to 1.6 kg loss was retained during a 1- to 6-week follow-up [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109342"&gt;1109342&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The efficacy of ipragliflozin administered in combination with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; in patients with T2DM (n = 343) was assessed in a phase II, randomized, parallel-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="66155"&gt;NCT01117584&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1941-CL-0005; 2009-013881-25; BALANCE). This trial was a 12-week trial enrolling patients who had received prior &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; therapy but did not have adequately controlled blood glucose levels. Patients were administered &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; (&gt;/= 1500 mg po, qd) in combination with ipragliflozin (12.5, 50, 150 or 300 mg po, qd) or placebo. Results have been reported from 337 patients. Decrease in HbA1c versus baseline was greater for higher dose groups than for lower dose groups, and ranged from 0.53 to 0.79% at week 12, compared with 0.31% for placebo (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Target HbA1c levels of &amp;lt; 7% were achieved in 33.3, 54.5, 53.0 and 52.1% of patients in the four respective ipragliflozin dose groups, and in 33.8% of patients receiving placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265723"&gt;1265723&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These results have not been subjected to peer-review.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase II, randomized, parallel-assignment, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="64293"&gt;NCT01071850&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1941-CL-0004), patients (n = 412) with T2DM were administered ipragliflozin (12.5, 50, 150, 300 mg po, qd), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; (1000 to 1500 mg po, qd) or placebo. Results have been reported from 411 patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265721"&gt;1265721&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Again, the decrease in HbA1c levels versus baseline for patients treated with ipragliflozin was dose dependent, and ranged from 0.49 to 0.81% at the end of the treatment period. Decrease in HbA1c was 0.46% for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt;, and there was an increase from baseline in HbA1c of 0.26% for placebo (p &amp;lt; 0.001 for ipragliflozin versus placebo) at week 12. Target HbA1c levels of &amp;lt; 7% were achieved in 20.0, 22.4, 23.5 and 38.2% of patients in the four respective ipragliflozin dose groups, 34.8% of patients receiving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt;, and 14.5% of patients receiving placebo (p = 0.002 for ipragliflozin versus placebo) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265721"&gt;1265721&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;Currently, no phase III trials evaluating the efficacy of ipragliflozin have been subjected to peer-review.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, monotherapy clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="63779"&gt;NCT01057628&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1941-CL-0105; BRIGHTEN) was conducted to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ipragliflozin in Japanese patients (n = 129; baseline HbA1c = 8.32%) with T2DM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1219276"&gt;1219276&lt;/ulink&gt;]. BRIGHTEN was the first phase III trial to assess the effect of SGLT-2 inhibition in the Japanese population. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomized, depending on washout of previous antidiabetic therapy or drug naivety, and administered either ipragliflozin (50 mg po, qd; n = 62) or placebo (n = 67) for 16 weeks. At the end of treatment with ipragliflozin, HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and mean body weight were all significantly decreased compared with placebo (placebo corrected values of 1.23%, 45 mg/dl and 1.47 kg, respectively; p &amp;lt; 0.001). In addition, 43.5% of patients in the ipragliflozin group reached the target HbA1c of &amp;lt; 7.4%, while only 4.5% of patients achieved this target with placebo. A significant reduction in body weight was observed in the ipragliflozin-treated patients, with a loss of 2.36 kg versus baseline, compared with a loss of 0.89 kg in the placebo group (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Fasting plasma glucose levels decreased by 39.9 mg/dl versus baseline in the ipragliflozin-treated group, compared with an increase of 5.9 mg/dl in the placebo group (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Fasting insulin levels decreased by 1.28 and 0.08 microU/ml in the ipragliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.096). Adiponectin levels increased from baseline by 0.29 microg/ml in the ipragliflozin group, but decreased by 0.22 microg/ml in the placebo group (p = 0.001), likely because of changes in body weight. Additionally, reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-3.2 and -2.5 mm/Hg from baseline, respectively) were reported in the ipragliflozin group; data for the placebo group were not provided [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1219276"&gt;1219276&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Additional phase III, randomized, parallel-group-assignment clinical trials have been completed. &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="63603"&gt;NCT01054092&lt;/ulink&gt; (1941-CL-0121) was a long-term (52 weeks), open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial in Japanese patients (n = 182) with T2DM who received ipragliflozin (po, dose not specified) either before or after meals. &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="66900"&gt;NCT01135433&lt;/ulink&gt; (1941-CL-0106) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which Japanese patients (n = 168) with T2DM who received prior &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; therapy but did not have adequately control blood glucose levels, received ipragliflozin (po, dose not specified) in combination with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; (po, dose not specified) for 24 weeks.

Two healthy volunteers also presented with increased beta2-microglobulin levels to &amp;gt; 200 microg/l. Both were receiving the 100-mg single dose, one of whom was dosed in a fed state and the other in a fasting state; however, these were not believed to be clinically significant. The most commonly reported adverse events in the multiple-dose arm were increases in levels of urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase to &amp;gt; 11.5 U/l, occurring in one, six and three healthy volunteers receiving the 20-, 50- and 100-mg dose of ipragliflozin, respectively. Increases in beta2-microglobulin to &amp;gt; 200 microg/l were also reported, in two and one healthy volunteers in the 20- and 50-mg ipragliflozin dose groups, respectively. One healthy volunteer in the 20-mg ipragliflozin multiple-dose group exhibited an increase in QTc interval on days 1 and 9 of 30 to 60 ms at 8-h post dose [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265841"&gt;1265841&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="75168"&gt;NCT01302145&lt;/ulink&gt; trial, 16.7% of patients in both the ipragliflozin and placebo groups reported gastrointestinal problems [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1220119"&gt;1220119&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="62341"&gt;NCT01023945&lt;/ulink&gt; trial, serum ketone levels were elevated following ipragliflozin treatment compared with placebo. Furthermore, one patient with T2DM in this trial experienced a non-fatal myocardial infarction when receiving ipragliflozin once-daily for 14 days [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1201952"&gt;1201952&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Results from the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="65301"&gt;NCT01097681&lt;/ulink&gt; trial suggested that a single dose of ipragliflozin was safe and well tolerated in patients with renal impairment [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1220547"&gt;1220547&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Urinary tract infections, which are a potential concern with SGLT-2 inhibitors [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1262191"&gt;1262191&lt;/ulink&gt;], occurred in the phase II &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="35705"&gt;NCT00790660&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="7987"&gt;NCT00621868&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="66155"&gt;NCT01117584&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="64293"&gt;NCT01071850&lt;/ulink&gt; trials, and the phase III &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="63779"&gt;NCT01057628&lt;/ulink&gt; trial.

Nausea and headache were reported in both ipragliflozin and placebo groups, although incidence was higher for placebo (23.1 versus 10.4% and 38.5 versus 16.7%, respectively). Back pain was reported in 10.4% of patients receiving ipragliflozin, compared with no patients in the placebo group. One case of mild hypoglycemia was reported in the ipragliflozin group. There was no change in volume of voided urine among treatment groups [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254275"&gt;1254275&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="66155"&gt;NCT01117584&lt;/ulink&gt; trial, the incidence of hypoglycemia was comparable between ipragliflozin and placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265723"&gt;1265723&lt;/ulink&gt;] and, in the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="64293"&gt;NCT01071850&lt;/ulink&gt; trial, the incidence of hypoglycemia was reported to be 0 to 1.5% across all groups. In the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="64293"&gt;NCT01071850&lt;/ulink&gt; trial, instances of genital tract infection were higher for ipragliflozin groups (4.1%) compared with placebo (1.4%) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265721"&gt;1265721&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="63779"&gt;NCT01057628&lt;/ulink&gt; phase III clinical trial, one case of mild hypoglycemia and two cases of genital tract infection were reported in the ipragliflozin groups, while one urinary tract infection was reported in the placebo group [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1219276"&gt;1219276&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Furthermore, a phase I, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, crossover-assignment, double-blind clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="71864"&gt;NCT01232413&lt;/ulink&gt;; 9141-Cl-0058) was conducted to assess the effect of ipragliflozin on cardiac repolarization in healthy volunteers (n = 88) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1269577"&gt;1269577&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients were treated with placebo, 100 mg/day of ipragliflozin, 600 mg/day of ipragliflozin or 400 mg of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="12978"&gt;moxifloxacin&lt;/ulink&gt;. Each was administered for 7 days (except &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="12978"&gt;moxifloxacin&lt;/ulink&gt;, which was administered once on day 7 only) with a washout period of at least 7 days between each treatment. QTcF intervals &amp;gt; 480 ms or time-matched changes from baseline &amp;gt; 60 ms were not reported following ipragliflozin treatment. The largest upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the mean QTcF difference versus placebo were 2.88 and 4.44 ms for the 100- and 600-mg dose groups, respectively, and was &amp;lt; 10 ms in all volunteers. Data following &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="12978"&gt;moxifloxacin&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment confirmed the sensitivity of the assay [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1269577"&gt;1269577&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Patent summary&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17687"&gt;Kotobuki&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1013295"&gt;Astellas&lt;/ulink&gt; first claimed C-glucoside derivatives, including ipragliflozin, in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA2910456"&gt;WO-2004080990&lt;/ulink&gt; (filed March 2003), as SGLT inhibitors, useful for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM, insulin-resistance-related disease and obesity.

This application has been granted in Japan as &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA6575953"&gt;JP-04759102&lt;/ulink&gt; (expiring in October 2030), while corresponding European regional and US national filings were not available at the time of publication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Ipragliflozin has demonstrated potential as a therapy for the treatment of T2DM. It binds more effectively to SGLT-2 than its naturally occurring equivalent, phlorizin, and the distal rings of ipragliflozin with lipophilic groups result in a greater selectivity for SGLT-2 and decreased binding to SGLT-1 compared with phlorizin [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1042660"&gt;1042660&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109384"&gt;1109384&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This activity is comparable with other drugs in the same class, such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1042660"&gt;1042660&lt;/ulink&gt;], &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="57592"&gt;canagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1267887"&gt;1267887&lt;/ulink&gt;] and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="58762"&gt;empagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1267901"&gt;1267901&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This selectivity results in dose-dependent increases in UGE, as a result of inhibition of glucose reabsorption in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule of the nephron, but does not interfere with glucose absorption in the intestine initiated by SGLT-1.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;After 16 weeks of treatment with ipragliflozin, Japanese patients with T2DM experienced a significant decrease in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and mean body weight compared with placebo in the phase III &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="63779"&gt;NCT01057628&lt;/ulink&gt; clinical trial [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1219276"&gt;1219276&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar improvements were also observed after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with T2DM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265723"&gt;1265723&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Ipragliflozin administration resulted in clinically relevant dose-dependent decreases in HbA1c (-0.53 to -0.79%, compared with -0.31% for placebo) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1265723"&gt;1265723&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These results are particularly impressive, as many other recently introduced treatments, such as DPP-4 inhibitors, show substantially smaller improvements in HbA1c over the same time-course of treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257116"&gt;1257116&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Phase II clinical trials indicated that higher doses of ipragliflozin resulted in greater body weight reduction, but did not result in further meaningful decreases in HbA1c [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109342"&gt;1109342&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further reduction in weight loss with higher doses of ipragliflozin (&gt;/= 100 mg) is supported by dose-dependent increases in UGE at these dose levels. Lack of additional meaningful glycemic improvements at ipragliflozin doses of &gt;/= 100 mg could possibly be the result of: (i) altered glucoregulatory mechanisms in T2DM that prohibit further improvement caused by increased UGE alone; (ii) achieving improved circulating glucose levels at higher doses (&gt;/= 100 mg) compared with moderate (50 mg) doses, but this not being reflected as further enhancement in HbA1c because of the short duration of the trial; and (iii) normal glucose levels being reached with moderate doses (50 mg), but not resulting in normal HbA1c levels because of the short duration of the trial, and higher doses not providing further glycemic advantage, as endogenous glucose production by the liver avoids hypoglycemia. Currently, it is unclear whether treatment with higher doses of ipragliflozin (100 versus 50 mg), possibly resulting in further weight loss, would enhance glucose regulation.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;Metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; is generally regarded as the first therapeutic option for the treatment of T2DM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257134"&gt;1257134&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It is likely that ipragliflozin, in addition to other SGLT-2 inhibitors, will be utilized as a monotherapy or in combination with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt;. Sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs are all used in a similar manner [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257134"&gt;1257134&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In general, decreases in HbA1c observed with ipragliflozin alone are ~ 0.5 to 1%, suggesting glycemic improvements with ipragliflozin treatment in patients with T2DM may be equivalent or better than the aforementioned therapies. For comparison, meta-analysis of glycemic improvements reported with the use of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; as a monotherapy for T2DM revealed a 0.52% decrease in HbA1c [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254768"&gt;1254768&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; has been described in numerous peer-reviewed publications, while the glucoregulatory effects of ipragliflozin in patients with T2DM have only been reported for four clinical trials, only two of which have been evaluated by peer-review, although glucose parameters have been reported for ~ 1200 patients with T2DM treated with ipragliflozin (12.5 to 300 mg for up to 16 weeks in phase II trials). Meta-analysis indicates that the aforementioned agents are added to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment, they further augment decreases in HbA1c by ~ 0.65 to 1%, with no statistical difference among groups [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257134"&gt;1257134&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Initial mouse studies indicate that a combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; and ipragliflozin resulted in greater decreases in HbA1c levels compared with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; alone [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1088892"&gt;1088892&lt;/ulink&gt;] and, in the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="75168"&gt;NCT01302145&lt;/ulink&gt; clinical trial, a greater level of UGE was achieved in patients with T2DM treated with a combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; and ipragliflozin compared with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; plus placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1220119"&gt;1220119&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further evidence of the improvement in circulating glucose levels, both as a mono- and combination therapy, must be provided before making an adequate comparison.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In addition to glycemic improvements and oral availability, decreases in body mass are a noted advantage of SGLT-2 treatment. The weight loss experienced by patients with T2DM treated with ipragliflozin provides a marked improvement, as weight gain is a common side effect of single agent and combination treatments that increase insulin levels or insulin sensitivity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1109342"&gt;1109342&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1201952"&gt;1201952&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1219276"&gt;1219276&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254275"&gt;1254275&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257116"&gt;1257116&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Treatment with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6050"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; is not associated with weight gain, but the addition of sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones and biphasic insulin generally results in a significant increase in body mass (1.8 to 3 kg) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257134"&gt;1257134&lt;/ulink&gt;], once again, making ipragliflozin a likely candidate for combination therapy.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The rare genetic mutation of the SLC5 gene, which encodes SGLT-2, results in familial glycosuria, but generally the disease presents no adverse effects [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1254757"&gt;1254757&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, as previously mentioned, concerns have been raised by the FDA regarding the safety of SGLT-2 &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt; citing possible increased instances of bladder and breast cancers and hepatic toxicity, which have delayed its approval pending the release of further phase III data [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257100"&gt;1257100&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Treatment with ipragliflozin, although limited in trial patient numbers and duration, has so far not demonstrated evidence of bladder cancer, breast cancer or hepatic events. Similar to ipragliflozin, gastrointestinal problems, as well as urinary tract and genital infections, have been reported with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="52192"&gt;dapagliflozin&lt;/ulink&gt;, but were not the deciding factor in the delaying of approval [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1257100"&gt;1257100&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It is possible that these particular side-effects are the result of dehydration or elevated ketone levels caused by fatty acid oxidation, as noted in the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="62341"&gt;NCT01023945&lt;/ulink&gt; trial [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1201952"&gt;1201952&lt;/ulink&gt;], both of which should be closely monitored with SGLT-2 inhibition.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In summary, ipragliflozin is a selective SGLT-2 inhibitor that decreases circulating glucose levels by increasing UGE in patients with T2DM. Once-daily oral administration for 4 to 16 weeks decreased HbA1c levels and body mass, with low incidence of adverse events, including hypoglycemia. These effects make ipragliflozin a likely candidate for use in the treatment of T2DM; however, continued and extended phase II and III clinical trials must be completed with subsequent peer-review to assess efficacy as a monotherapy and combination therapy and to address lingering safety concerns.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company
