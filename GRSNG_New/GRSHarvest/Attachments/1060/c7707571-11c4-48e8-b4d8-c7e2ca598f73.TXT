In the EU, decitabine is approved for the treatment of older adults (&amp;gt;/=  65 years of age) with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary  acute myeloid leukemia (AML), according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification, who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="1327193" linkType="Reference"&gt;1327193&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2006, the drug was launched for MDS in the US [&lt;ulink linkID="669842" linkType="Reference"&gt;669842&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2010, the FDA approved a 5-day dosing regimen for iv decitabine in MDS [&lt;ulink linkID="1081684" linkType="Reference"&gt;1081684&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The drug will not be marketed in the EU for MDS; following a request for survival data from the EMA, development was subsequently terminated [&lt;ulink linkID="634721" linkType="Reference"&gt;634721&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1121010" linkType="Reference"&gt;1121010&lt;/ulink&gt;]. J&amp;amp;J subsidiary  Janssen  was developing the drug for MDS in Japan, however, by August 2012, Janssen had terminated development  [&lt;ulink linkID="1315322" linkType="Reference"&gt;1315322&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In March 2014, Otsuka acquired rights to the drug in selected regions, including in Japan, and Japanese development was presumed to underway again [&lt;ulink linkID="1540642" linkType="Reference"&gt;1540642&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By October 2012,  the drug had been launched  in the EU, including the UK, for newly diagnosed de novo or secondary  AML [&lt;ulink linkID="1327193" linkType="Reference"&gt;1327193&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1329684" linkType="Reference"&gt;1329684&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1354285" linkType="Reference"&gt;1354285&lt;/ulink&gt;].

However, in March 2012, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL); the Agency noted that the DACO-016 study did not provide compelling evidence of safety and effectiveness in AML [&lt;ulink linkID="1269360" linkType="Reference"&gt;1269360&lt;/ulink&gt;]; by May 2013, Eisai had decided to discontinue the decitabine development program for AML in the US following receipt of  a complete response letter from the FDA in March 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1419352" linkType="Reference"&gt;1419352&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2017, a phase II trial was initiated for AML with chromosomal abnormalities [&lt;ulink linkID="1909356" linkType="Reference"&gt;1909356&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The product is also being developed for the potential treatment of  chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). In October 2014, a phase III trial was initiated in CMML patients; in December 2018, the trial was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1722896" linkType="Reference"&gt;1722896&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Decitabine was also previously being developed for a number of other indications, including sickle cell disease, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML),  metastatic renal cell carcinoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic melanoma. Phase I/II trials for sickle cell anemia were underway by November 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="388307" linkType="Reference"&gt;388307&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no further development has been reported since August 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="501709" linkType="Reference"&gt;501709&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Phase II trials in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer were underway in 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="358098" linkType="Reference"&gt;358098&lt;/ulink&gt;], however no further development has been reported. Trials in refractory CML were carried out in 2002 and 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="516830" linkType="Reference"&gt;516830&lt;/ulink&gt;]; MGI was continuing these trials after it in-licensed the drug in 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="592015" linkType="Reference"&gt;592015&lt;/ulink&gt;], however by 2007 the company was no longer mentioning CML and no further development was reported. SuperGen listed the drug as in phase I/II trials for breast cancer in March 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="489238" linkType="Reference"&gt;489238&lt;/ulink&gt;], however no development was reported. A phase II trial in  metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma was initiated in October 2007, however the trial was terminated in November 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="998428" linkType="Reference"&gt;998428&lt;/ulink&gt;], and no further development was reported. In June 2008, a phase I/II  study of  decitabine in combination with temozolomide in metastatic melanoma was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="959009" linkType="Reference"&gt;959009&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in June 2010, data were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="1105071" linkType="Reference"&gt;1105071&lt;/ulink&gt;], but no further development was reported.  A phase I trial for ALL began in July 2006 and was completed in October 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1019573" linkType="Reference"&gt;1019573&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no further development was reported. Investigator-led phase II trials were conducted in the late 1990s in hormone-independent prostate cancer. In December 2009, a phase I trial in metastatic colorectal cancer was initiated in the US; in January 2013, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1441972" linkType="Reference"&gt;1441972&lt;/ulink&gt;]; no development has been reported in the US; in March 2014, Janssen was collaborating on an investigator-sponsored, phase I/II trial of decitabine administered by hepatic arterial infusion in metastatic colorectal cancer; in July 2017, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1898887" linkType="Reference"&gt;1898887&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no further development was reported.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Eisai  was also previously developing an &lt;ulink linkID="75179" linkType="Drug"&gt;oral formulation of decitabine&lt;/ulink&gt;; however, no further development was reported.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><PatentsAndGenerics><displayLabel>Patents and Generics</displayLabel><value>&lt;PatentsAndGenerics&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, SuperGen received a Notice of Allowance from the USPTO for patent claims relating to decitabine, as part of a combination therapy with other anticancer agents, to treat multiple cancer indications through the correction of DNA hypermethylation [&lt;ulink linkID="496103" linkType="Reference"&gt;496103&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2009, Eisai planned to apply to the FDA for pediatric exclusivity for decitabine upon completion of a pediatric study; at that time, the company believed that if the exclusivity was granted, the drug's patent expiration would be extended to November 2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1023515" linkType="Reference"&gt;1023515&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2019, &lt;ulink linkID="27614" linkType="Company"&gt;Wockhardt&lt;/ulink&gt; received US FDA approval for its generic version of decitabine (50 mg).

In August 2014, &lt;ulink linkID="1052219" linkType="Company"&gt;InnoPharma&lt;/ulink&gt; received FDA approval for its generic version of decitabine; InnoPharma developed the generic product which would be marketed by &lt;ulink linkID="28696" linkType="Company"&gt;Sandoz&lt;/ulink&gt; under a commercialization agreement for between the two companies [&lt;ulink linkID="1588778" linkType="Reference"&gt;1588778&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/PatentsAndGenerics&gt;</value></PatentsAndGenerics><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Myelodysplastic syndrome&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2003, the FDA granted decitabine Fast Track status for the treatment of advanced-stage MDS [&lt;ulink linkID="489260" linkType="Reference"&gt;489260&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2004, the FDA approved SuperGen's request to submit a rolling NDA [&lt;ulink linkID="534389" linkType="Reference"&gt;534389&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2004, SuperGen submitted the first portion of its rolling NDA for MDS [&lt;ulink linkID="541299" linkType="Reference"&gt;541299&lt;/ulink&gt;], and by November 2004, the full NDA had been submitted [&lt;ulink linkID="568057" linkType="Reference"&gt;568057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The NDA had been accepted by the FDA by January 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="568057" linkType="Reference"&gt;568057&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="577892" linkType="Reference"&gt;577892&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="584159" linkType="Reference"&gt;584159&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2005, the FDA issued an approvable letter requesting an analysis of the transfusion requirements of patients enrolled in the phase III trial, submission of further information and completion of labeling discussions [&lt;ulink linkID="620967" linkType="Reference"&gt;620967&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By November 2005, the companies had completed the analysis and submitted a full response to the FDA [&lt;ulink linkID="634721" linkType="Reference"&gt;634721&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2006, the FDA approved decitabine for MDS including previously treated and untreated, de novo, and secondary MDS of all French-American-British  subtypes [&lt;ulink linkID="665258" linkType="Reference"&gt;665258&lt;/ulink&gt;], and the product was launched  in the US later that month  [&lt;ulink linkID="669842" linkType="Reference"&gt;669842&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2009, the FDA accepted for review an sNDA filing by Eisai for an alternative 5-day dosing regimen for  iv decitabine to treat patients with MDS [&lt;ulink linkID="1024119" linkType="Reference"&gt;1024119&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in March 2010, approval was granted [&lt;ulink linkID="1081684" linkType="Reference"&gt;1081684&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Acute myeloid leukemia&lt;/subtitle&gt;In August 2006, the FDA granted decitabine Orphan Drug status for the treatment of AML [&lt;ulink linkID="683537" linkType="Reference"&gt;683537&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2011, Eisai filed an sNDA for use of decitabine in the treatment of AML; the filing was accepted in July 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1207311" linkType="Reference"&gt;1207311&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1207313" linkType="Reference"&gt;1207313&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2012, the agency's ODAC voted 10 to 3 against recommending approval of decitabine in AML; the panel stated that the available data from the DACO-016 did not adequately demonstrate a favorable benefit-risk profile [&lt;ulink linkID="1261719" linkType="Reference"&gt;1261719&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Kaplan Meier curves for time to AML progression or death showed clinically meaningful separation in favor of decitabine. There were no treatment related deaths, although grades 3 to 4 toxicity, including febrile neutropenia, occurred in more decitabine patients than in the supportive care group.  The overall response rate was 17% (9% CR) compared with 0% for supportive care. The time-to-AML transformation or time-to-death was significantly longer for decitabine compared with the control arm.

The subjects were to receive decitabine (20 mg/m2/day) daily for 3 days every 28 days or daily every 7 days for 21 days. The primary endpoint was overall improvement rate (CR + PR + marrow CR + hematological improvement). The study was expected to complete in April 2012 and still recruiting in October 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="958831" linkType="Reference"&gt;958831&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Significant differences in overall improvement rates (OIR; 23%) were not observed between groups (decitabine (schedule A: 20 mg/m2/day; n = 43) and once q7d for 21 days (schedule B: n = 22)) at the study end. Relevant between-group differences were also not observed in OIR by patient age group. The complete response (CR) was observed in seven patients in schedule A group; and in schedule B group, one patient showed marrow CR and one other showed partial response; hematological improvement was observed in three patients in each of the groups. Significant differences between groups, in the overall survival (OS) and time to AML transformation or death were not observed; the median OS was not achieved [&lt;ulink linkID="1246078" linkType="Reference"&gt;1246078&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2007,  data from a 99-patient, multicenter, open-label, 	 phase II study of an alternative decitabine dosing regimen in which the drug was dosed 20 mg/m2 iv over 1 h qd for 5 days on a 4-week cycle were also presented at the 49th ASH meeting.

In the phase II trial, newly diagnosed AML patients aged 60 years or over were treated with 20 mg/m2 doses of decitabine over 1 h for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. Of 29 evaluable patients, 29% had a response and 2% a morphologic complete response. A total of 11 patients achieved stable disease. Median time to response was three treatment cycles. The most common adverse events reported include, myelosuppression, fatigue, nausea, febrile neutropenia, vomiting, asthenia, diarrhea and pneumonia. A multicenter phase III trial in elderly AML patients was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="750548" linkType="Reference"&gt;750548&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="749176" linkType="Reference"&gt;749176&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2007, similar clinical data were presented at the 43rd ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL [&lt;ulink linkID="796122" linkType="Reference"&gt;796122&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2008, additional results from the trial were presented at the 50th ASH meeting in San Francisco, CA. In the trial,  which enrolled 55 patients (53% with intermediate risk cytogenetics and 42% with poor risk cytogenetics),  the overall response rate was 26%, with 24% of patients achieving a morphological complete response, while 2% of patients achieved a complete response with incomplete blood count recovery. The median time to response was three months. Responses were observed in all subgroups of patients. In addition, disease stabilization was maintained by 44% of patients during a median of five cycles of therapy. Myelosuppression, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, pneumonia, sepsis, dyspnea and bacteraemia were the most commonly reported adverse events considered   related to treatment. This study supports the investigation of decitabine in an ongoing phase III survival trial (n = 480) of the 5-day regimen in elderly patients with AML [&lt;ulink linkID="969824" linkType="Reference"&gt;969824&lt;/ulink&gt;] [&lt;ulink linkID="967723" linkType="Reference"&gt;967723&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In a trial in 51 previously untreated AML patients   (median age = 72 years; range = 63 to 85) receiving low dose decitabine, stable disease  (SD) was seen in three patients (10%), seven had progressive disease (24%), and one patient died early (3%; 9 days from start of treatment). Two patients (1 SD, 1 adverse event) were discontinued  after 2 courses because of prolonged neutropenia. Overall, low dose decitabine was well tolerated. Toxicities included neutropenia, fever/infection, and pancytopenia. Median overall survival from the start of treatment was 7.5 months (range =  0.3 to 21 months+), and  the 1-year survival rate was 24%. In CR and PR patients, median overall survival was not reached. In patients with adverse events overall survival was 7.8 months, and in nonresponders overall survival was 1 month [&lt;ulink linkID="639897" linkType="Reference"&gt;639897&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2005, a phase II, randomized, active-controlled, open-label safety and efficacy study (&lt;ulink linkID="29164" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00760084&lt;/ulink&gt;) was initiated in patients (n = 16) with AML or MDS. Patients were treated with 20 mg/m2 decitabine over a 1 h iv infusion for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. The study completed in February 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="1107253" linkType="Reference"&gt;1107253&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Data were also presented at the 47th ASH meeting on a pharmacokinetic trial in 12 patients with either MDS (n = 6) or relapsed/refractory AML (n = 6). The dosing schedule was the same as the phase III trial, with a second cycle repeated 6 weeks after the first.  Decitabine did not accumulate in the plasma during the 3 days of dosing, and CLp remained unchanged. For the five patients who had received decitabine for two cycles, Cmax  values for cycle 1 (49.0 +/- 22.2 ng/ml) and cycle 2 (62.7 +/- 45.2) were comparable. This dosing schedule was  generally well tolerated. Serious adverse events included neutropenia and fever (two patients) and infection (one patient with gram positive bacteremia and pneumonia); one patient died of sepsis, and two died of progressive AML. Of the four patients who had been assessed for response after 2 cycles of decitabine, one patient with MDS had a CR, one patient with MDS had hematologic improvement, and two patients (one MDS, one AML) had no response [&lt;ulink linkID="640420" linkType="Reference"&gt;640420&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a phase I study in 14 AML patients, patients were administered decitabine at iv doses of 15 (n = 8) and 20 mg/m2/day (n = 6) on the same schedule every 28 days. The mean short and long half lives were 2.7 and 36.8 min, respectively. Four of ten patients who had completed 2 cycles of treatment responded (two at each dose level), three had a CR with incomplete recovery of counts, and one had a CR. Clinical benefit was seen in three additional patients: one achieved neutrophils of 2,200/microl, platelets &amp;gt;100,000/microl, disappearance of circulating blasts, and disappearance of bone marrow blasts; one patient achieved platelet transfusion independence (&amp;gt;100,000/microl); one patient had SD for 6 months. Two patients were not evaluable for response due to death from sepsis or death related to decitabine-induced differentiation syndrome. The drug was well tolerated, and no severe non-hematologic drug related toxicities were observed [&lt;ulink linkID="640425" linkType="Reference"&gt;640425&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2005,  data on decitabine in combination with valproic acid were presented at the 41st ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. In a phase I/II trial, 51 patients with AML  and MDS were administered  decitabine (15 mg/m2 iv qd)  followed by oral valproic acid (20, 35 and 50  mg/kg qd)  for 10 days. 40 out of 51 patients were evaluable for response; 9 patients had a CR to treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="603857" linkType="Reference"&gt;603857&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data from the  phase II portion of this  trial were presented at the 47th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA. At that time 54 patients (Median age = 60 years; range 5 to 80; 52 AML and two MDS patients) had been treated, and the study was closed to new patient accrual. The phase II combination consisted of valproic acid (50 mg/kg, qd) with decitabine. Ten patients achieved a  CR and two achieved  a CRp (without complete platelet recovery), for an overall response rate of 22%. Two of 12 patients (16%) achieved a response at lower doses of valproic acid and five  of 11 (45%) previously untreated older patients achieved a CR. The median overall survival (OS) for the whole group was 5.3 months, and the median duration of response was shown to be 8.3 months. Complete cytogenetic responses were observed in four of four patients with informative karyotypes. Twelve of 35 (34%) patients receiving valproic acid at a dose of 50 mg/kg showed  evidence of histone acetylation, compared to one of 12 (8%) at the lower doses [&lt;ulink linkID="641208" linkType="Reference"&gt;641208&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2006, further data on decitabine in combination with valproic acid were presented at the 42nd ASCO meeting in Atlanta, GA. Patients received 20 mg/m2/day of decitabine followed by valproic acid 15 mg/kg daily qd on days 5 to 21. Of the 13 patients tested, 10 responded to decitabine treatment and showed CR. The addition of valporic acid resulted in infectious complications, with myelosuppression seen in all patients. Neutropenic fever was observed in 64% of patients and fatigue and infection were both seen in 48%. Dose-limiting confusion or somnolence occurred in 3 patients. It was concluded that although minimal concentrations of decitabine resulted in positive clinical effects, other HDAC inhibitors would be used in future trials [&lt;ulink linkID="669512" linkType="Reference"&gt;669512&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="671162" linkType="Reference"&gt;671162&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="671665" linkType="Reference"&gt;671665&lt;/ulink&gt;].

All patients had an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk score of intermediate I or higher. Platelet responses occurred in 63% of patients and were observed after only one cycle of decitabine administration in 58% of patients. The platelet responses also led to a favorable survival prediction [&lt;ulink linkID="548217" linkType="Reference"&gt;548217&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="548181" linkType="Reference"&gt;548181&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Further data from this trial were presented at the 47th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA, in December 2005. Patients (median age 65; 31-90 years) were given decitabine in three dosing schedules: 20 mg/m2 over 1 h daily x 5; 10 mg/m2 iv over 1 h daily x 10 or 10 mg/m2 sc BID x 5. Of the 96 subjects treated, 40 (42%) showed complete remission , five (5%) partial remissions and two (2%) hematologic improvements.

In June 2006, data from a completed phase III MDS trial were presented at the 42nd ASCO meeting in Atlanta, GA. The open-label trial enrolled 170 patients who received decitabine and support care, of which 10 of 26 evaluable patients developed a cytogenic response. In comparison, only 2 of 10 patients responded in the group that received supportive care alone.

In the accelerated phase cohort, three of 11 evaluable patients had a CHR, four demonstrated a PHR+HI, none showed a CGCR and four had a mCR. In the blastic phase cohort, eight of 21 evaluable patients had a CHR, seven showed PHR+HI, one showed a CGCR and ten had a mCR. One patient died on day 6 of thrombocytopenia-related hemorrhage. Overall, the treatment was well tolerated, with no drug-related grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicity observed. Grade 3/4 neutropenia developed in 18 of 25 patients, and 13 of 25 patients developed neutropenic fever requiring hospitalization. Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 6 of 16 patients [&lt;ulink linkID="516830" linkType="Reference"&gt;516830&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2005, follow-up data from this trial were presented at the 47th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA.  At that time,  27  patients (eight blastic phase, BP; 19 accelerated phase, AP) had been enrolled on the trial: clonal evolution was observed in 21 patients (77%), 24 patients (88%) had failed prior therapy with imatinib, and three (12%) were newly diagnosed. Grade 3/4 toxicity included infection (n  = 9), CNS bleed (n = 2), GI bleed (n = 2), dyspnea (n = 1), diarrhea (n = 1), and edema (n = 1). Seven patients (26%) received only 1 cycle of treatment, owing to early death from acute disease progression (n = 5), recurrent subdural hematoma (n = 1), and a patient's decision due to grade 3 diarrhea (n = 1). Of the evaluable patients, nine patients (33%) achieved CR and three patients (11%) achieved PR. These included seven patients (26%) that achieved cytogenetic response (three complete cytogenetic response (Ph 0%), one partial cytogenetic response (Ph &amp;lt; 35%), and three minor cytogenetic response (Ph &amp;lt; 90%). Median response duration was 13 weeks (range 4 to 107), and median overall survival of patients with AP and BP were similar, 49 and 53 weeks, respectively. Median overall survival of patients with cytogenetic response (n = 7), hematologic response only (n = 5), and non-responders including those who received only 1 cycle (n = 15) were 86, 63, and 18 weeks, respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.01) [&lt;ulink linkID="638684" linkType="Reference"&gt;638684&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2003, preliminary results from two studies of decitabine were presented at the Chemotherapy Foundation Symposium XXI- Innovative Cancer Therapy for Tomorrow in New York, NY. In the first study, 27 patients, in various phases of CML and all of whom had failed treatment with &lt;ulink linkID="11460" linkType="Drug"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;, were enrolled and received either 10 or 15 mg/m2 of decitabine iv for 10 days, depending on the stage of the disease. A hematologic response was achieved in 63% and a cytogenetic response was achieved in 40%. In the second study, ten patients who presented with untreated accelerated or blastic phase CML, were treated with a combination of decitabine (15 mg/m2, iv, for 10 days) and imatinib (600 mg po daily). Of the ten patients enrolled, six were evaluable, with two patients having achieved a complete hematological response and one patient having achieved a minor cytogenetic response to date. No toxicity data had been reported at this time [&lt;ulink linkID="513319" linkType="Reference"&gt;513319&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, data from a phase II study of decitabine in patients with CML was published. Of 130 patients enrolled in the study, 55 achieved an overall objective response for an overall response rate of 43%. The objective response rate was 55% in accelerated phase and 28% in the blastic phase. Side effects included myelosuppression which was significant and dose-related. Myelosuppression-associated complications included febrile episodes of unknown origin in 37% of patients and documented infections in 34%. The first 13 patients were treated with decitabine (100 mg/m2) over 6 h every 12 h for 5 days. This was reduced to 75 mg/m2 in the next 33 patients and further reduced to 50 mg/m2 in the remaining 84 patients. Courses were repeated every 4 to 8 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="499577" linkType="Reference"&gt;499577&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2002, clinical data on high-dose decitabine were presented at the Leukemia 2002 meeting in Miami, FL. In advanced CML, 81 patients were treated (39 in accelerated phase and 42 in blastic phase). Decitabine, at doses of 50 to 100 mg/m2, was given over 6 h, bid for ten doses. The overall response rates observed were 62% in patients with less advanced disease and 29% in patients with blastic transformation [&lt;ulink linkID="468237" linkType="Reference"&gt;468237&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Patients (n = 13) with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas were treated with 2.5 to 10 mg/m2/day decitabine as a 1-h infusion for 5 days per week for a 2-week cycle. These doses were well-tolerated. The MTD was not reached and recruitment was ongoing to test doses up to 20 mg/m2/day.

In a phase I trial, patients with melanoma were administered with decitabine (5, 10, 15, 20 mg/m2, 1-h iv infusion) daily for 7 days, followed by iv infusions of doxorubicin (45 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2) on day 7.  Eleven patients had been enrolled. Serious side effects including prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were seen in 4 patients.

Patients with advanced solid tumours were intravenously administered decitabine at doses of 45, 90 and 135 mg/m2 over 6 h on day 1. Carboplatin was intravenously administered over 1 h on day 8 at a fixed dose of AUC5 and treatment was repeated every 4 weeks. The MTD of decitabine was 135 mg/m2, with grade 4 febrile neutropenia, and grade 4 neutropenia causing a delay of cycle 2 of more than 7 days. DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells showed a dose-dependent decrease in levels of 5-methyl-2-deoxycytidine up to day 10 which then reversed and returned to near starting levels by day 22. This demethylation occurred in a similar fashion in subsequent cycles of decitabine treatment. Treatment with the compound induced dose-dependent demethylation of the MAGE1A CpG-island in DNA extracted from PBM cells and buccal smears [&lt;ulink linkID="564750" linkType="Reference"&gt;564750&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Toxicity and efficacy data for this trial were also presented.  The recommended dose for phase II studies was 90 mg/m2 decitabine plus AUC 6 carboplatin. Of 35 patients enrolled, 22 were evaluable for efficacy. Of these, 6  demonstrated stable disease.

Three human lung cancer cell lines, A549 (wild-type p53), H1299 (p53-null) and H23 (mutant p53) were tested for the effect of decitabine on cell viability. Decitabine showed a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity on A549 cells, but induced cytotoxicity was much less in H23 and H1299 cells, indicating that p53 may play a role in decitabine-induced cytotoxicity. Western immunoblot analysis showed that decitabine treatment led to a significant increase in p53 expression/stabilization and an increase in the p53 regulated protein p21CIP1, both of which are unmethylated in the promoter region of these cells [&lt;ulink linkID="496506" linkType="Reference"&gt;496506&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Many cancers display abnormal hypermethylation of cytosine residues in CpG islands in the promoter regions of critical genes such as tumor suppressor genes, DNA repair genes, genes regulating surface adhesion molecules, and genes regulating immunogenic cell-surface proteins. Hypermethylation of CpG islands located in promoter regions leads to silencing of gene expression, and reversal of such hypermethylation can induce differentiation and apoptosis of malignant cells and may, therefore, be clinically useful. Attention has, therefore, recently been focused on drugs, such as decitabine, that can reverse hypermethylation, and on the relationship between DNA methylation, histones, chromatin structure and the mechanisms of gene transcription. Acetylation and methylation of histones also affects gene expression and cooperates with DNA methylation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518856"&gt;518856&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518858"&gt;518858&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518861"&gt;518861&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Decitabine is a pyrimidine analog that was first synthesized in 1964 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518828"&gt;518828&lt;/ulink&gt;], its potential anti-leukemic activity being reported in 1968 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518853"&gt;518853&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, preventing methylation of cytosine residues on DNA and leading to hypomethylation of gene promoters, thereby reactivating silenced genes. Decitabine is cytotoxic to a broad range of malignant cells in vitro, and clinical trials with decitabine have been in progress for over 20 years. It shows significant activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Enthusiasm for the drug was initially tempered by its significant marrow toxicity, although it shows remarkably little non-hemopoietic toxicity. In addition, despite good in vitro activity in non-hematological tumors, decitabine showed only modest clinical activity for these indications. However, recent studies show that decitabine may also influence histone acetylation and methylation to reactivate silenced genes, and interest in the drug as a potential treatment for solid tumors was renewed following the discovery of potential synergies between decitabine and chemotherapy, immunostimulants and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="449737"&gt;449737&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 1999, SuperGen Inc acquired the worldwide rights for decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="341375"&gt;341375&lt;/ulink&gt;], and in June 2004, submitted the first portion of its rolling NDA for MDS [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="541299"&gt;541299&lt;/ulink&gt;] based on encouraging phase III results for this indication [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="530064"&gt;530064&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the time of publication the full NDA had been submitted to the FDA [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="568057"&gt;568057&lt;/ulink&gt;], and an MAA for MDS had been accepted by the EMEA [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="566505"&gt;566505&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The ability of decitabine to reactivate silenced genes also led to its evaluation in sickle cell anemia, for which the compound was awarded Orphan Drug designation from the FDA [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="507427"&gt;507427&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This inherited disorder results in the production of the abnormal hemoglobin HbS which causes episodes of painful vascular occlusive events and premature death in affected individuals, the clinical severity of which is reduced by the presence of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which normally falls to adult levels within 3 to 6 months following birth [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518862"&gt;518862&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Decitabine is one of several analogs of the pyrimidine nucleoside cytidine, an essential component of DNA and an important target of anti-neoplastic therapy. The most important analog in anti-leukemic therapy has been cytosine arabinoside, but the development of drug resistance stimulated the search for analogs that would either overcome this resistance or improve upon the activity of cytosine arabinoside.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The synthesis of decitabine was originally described by Pliml and Sorm in a 1964 paper [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518828"&gt;518828&lt;/ulink&gt;], and used 3,5-di-O-p-toluyl-2-deoxy-D-ribofuranosyl isocyanate as the starting compound. Addition of 2-methylisourea to this isocyanate in chloroform as solvent afforded an intermediate, condensation of which with ethylorthoformate resulted in the formation of crystalline 1-(3,5-di-O-p-toluyl-2-deoxy-D-ribofuranosyl)-2-oxo-4-methoxy-1,2-di-hydro-1,3,5-triazine. Prolonged treatment of this triazine derivative with methanolic ammonia at room temperature gave two crystalline products, the main product of which represented either 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or its alpha-anomer.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Decitabine is an analog of deoxycytidine (beta-D-anomer of 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258504"&gt;258504&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It differs from deoxycytidine by substitution at position 5 of the pyrimidine ring with nitrogen. Decitabine contains deoxyribose, in contrast to the related analog, Pharmion Corp's 5-azacytidine (Vidaza), which contains a ribose sugar. Decitabine is, therefore, a deoxynucleoside and is incorporated into DNA, but not RNA, in contrast to 5-azacytidine which is incorporated into RNA. Decitabine and 5-azacytidine differ from other pyrimidine analogs, such as cytosine arabinoside and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt;, by modification at position 5 of the pyrimidine ring. This distinctive feature, which is not present in these latter drugs, is responsible for inhibition of DNA methyltransferase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518855"&gt;518855&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518856"&gt;518856&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Decitabine is 30-fold more potent than 5-azacytidine as an inducer of differentiation and is a more potent inhibitor of DNA methylation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518859"&gt;518859&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Cytosine arabinoside is also incorporated into DNA, but does not inhibit DNA methyltransferase or lead to demethylation. This compound differs from deoxycytidine only in the ribose moiety, with a hydroxyl group in the 2' arabinose position, but like decitabine it requires activation by deoxcytidine deaminase for cytotoxic activity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553880"&gt;553880&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Pseudoisocytidine and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine, further analogs with modifications of the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring, also inhibit demethylation, but analogs with position 6 substitutions, such as 6-azacytidine, do not [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553880"&gt;553880&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An anomeric form of decitabine, alpha-D-anomer of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, was synthesized and shown to be 100-fold less toxic than decitabine against leukemia cell lines and in a mouse leukemia model. The alpha-D-anomer converts spontaneously to the active beta-D-anomer in solution, however, which probably accounts for the limited activity of the stored alpha-D-anomer which is inactive when freshly prepared solutions are used [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553887"&gt;553887&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Comparative studies between decitabine, 5-azacytidine and cytosine arabinoside using in vitro leukemia cell lines and a mouse leukemia model showed that decitabine was the most potent anti-neoplastic agent [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382227"&gt;382227&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553889"&gt;553889&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;Decitabine must be activated to the triphosphate form by the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase prior to its incorporation into DNA. Once inserted into DNA it binds covalently and irreversibly to DNA methyltransferase, leading to the rapid loss of DNA methyltransferase activity within the cell [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518863"&gt;518863&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Not only does decitabine inactivate DNA methyltransferase 1, but it also facilitates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the enzyme [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="529848"&gt;529848&lt;/ulink&gt;], hence cells become rapidly depleted of DNA methyltransferase activity. During DNA replication with each cell division, cytosine cannot be methylated, and after two to three cell divisions, CpG sites become hypomethylated.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The mechanism of growth arrest and cell death is dependent on the decitabine dose. Cell death at high doses is mediated through covalent trapping of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) rather than DNA demethylation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553892"&gt;553892&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The Dnmt forms DNA adducts which are then sensed as DNA damage, thus activating the cell-death pathway [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518858"&gt;518858&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Activation of the p53 pathway has been shown to mediate growth arrest and cytotoxicity following decitabine treatment of colon cancer cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503317"&gt;503317&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The implication of p53 involvement is that intact p53 function may be necessary for clinical activity of decitabine. Interestingly, p53 mutations, although common in solid tumors, are rarely found in CML, which is particularly responsive to decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553894"&gt;553894&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Activation of cell-death pathways by decitabine was also identified by DNA microarray analysis of leukemic cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571686"&gt;571686&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this study, treatment with decitabine upregulated 421 genes and downregulated 350 genes. A total of 83 genes with &amp;gt; 2-fold increase in expression were further analyzed and, interestingly, only 50% had CpG islands in the promoter regions, suggesting that altered gene regulation was independent of direct promoter DNA methylation. Decitabine induced apoptosis, which was shown to involve activation of caspases 3 and 6 in some cell lines. The induction of the growth regulatory protein p21 coincided with growth arrest of one cell line. Induction of p21 was not associated with a changing methylation status of its promoter, suggesting that the effect of decitabine on gene regulation may not be mediated solely by promoter demethylation. Non-malignant normal and epithelial cell lines did not show changes in gene expression and showed significantly less cytotoxicity compared with the malignant cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571686"&gt;571686&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This finding contrasts with the marked induction of genes in normal fibroblasts in culture following treatment with decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518908"&gt;518908&lt;/ulink&gt;], but this may be accounted for by differing test conditions or evaluation of different gene sets.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Decitabine shows cytotoxicity and inhibits growth in a wide range of tumor cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258499"&gt;258499&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="278485"&gt;278485&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518864"&gt;518864&lt;/ulink&gt;] through complex mechanisms which may involve several pathways. The anti-proliferative effect of decitabine is dependent on dose and duration of exposure, with longer exposure leading to greater antitumor activity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518914"&gt;518914&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Studies on tumor cell cultures in vitro and in animal tumor models identified the critical cytotoxic concentration of decitabine as between 0.5 and 1.0 microg/ml [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518866"&gt;518866&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518914"&gt;518914&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518942"&gt;518942&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Decitabine is most toxic in rapidly dividing cells and produces greater cell kill in S phase compared with cells in G1 phase. Unlike cytosine arabinoside and 5-azacytidine, decitabine does not block progression of cells from G1 into S phase and, therefore, its cytotoxicity is not self limiting [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553896"&gt;553896&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, further studies have revealed that effects of decitabine on the cell cycle are complex and dose dependent. A study of human myeloma and EBV-transformed lymphoblastic cell lines showed that decitabine could induce cell-cycle arrest either at the G1 phase, in which case it was mediated by p21WAF1, or it could cause G2/M phase arrest, in which case it was mediated by activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. These actions were identified by manipulation of the cell culture using selective enzyme inhibitors [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518924"&gt;518924&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this study, growth inhibition at low drug doses (IC50 value = 2 to 4 x 10(-8)M) was associated with retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and increased expression of p21WAF, but not with induction of p16INK4A or apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis and p16INK4A methylation and expression required decitabine doses 10-fold higher (10(-6) to 10(-7) M). Hence at low concentrations decitabine appears to block cell-cycle progression through divergent pathways, p21WAF-mediated G1 arrest and p38 MAP kinase-mediated G2 arrest. Neither of these mechanisms required p16INK4A activation, suggesting that it is not an important mediator of growth arrest at low doses. Since effective drug concentrations in this study were in the order of 10(-7) M, which is readily attainable in clinical studies, these findings are particularly important in the context of new low-dose studies in hematological malignancies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="525622"&gt;525622&lt;/ulink&gt;] and sickle cell disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="501709"&gt;501709&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At low cytotoxic concentrations decitabine induces a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth and moderately increases differentiation markers in normal hemopoietic precursor cells cultured with cytokines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="475030"&gt;475030&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Human leukemic cells show functional and morphological changes in terminal differentiation in response to decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518859"&gt;518859&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518866"&gt;518866&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It is of particular interest that the expression of MHC class I molecules, HLA-DR and beta-2 microglobulin is markedly increased on the surface of leukemic cells during decitabine therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518872"&gt;518872&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This may be useful in designing immunotherapeutic approaches against leukemia. Decitabine also induces de novo expression of a variety of immunogenic tumor-associated antigens known as cancer testis antigens (CTAs) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="491529"&gt;491529&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503319"&gt;503319&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="525557"&gt;525557&lt;/ulink&gt;], which are comprehensively regulated by DNA methylation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="525560"&gt;525560&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Expression of the CTA MAGE-3 was strongly enhanced by decitabine in the lung and esophageal cancer cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518875"&gt;518875&lt;/ulink&gt;], and expression of the CTA NY-ESO-1 was enhanced by a decitabine/depsipeptide combination which facilitated preferential recognition of cancer cells by cytolytic T-lymphocytes specific for NY-ESO-1 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="457831"&gt;457831&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The expression of these tumor-associated antigens is restricted to neoplastic cells and so they are potentially ideal candidates for therapeutic vaccination or immunological strategies against tumors [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503319"&gt;503319&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="525557"&gt;525557&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Decitabine induces re-expression of a large number of genes, many of which are known to be silenced by hypermethylation in cancer, although in vitro studies indicate that 50 to 60% of genes induced by decitabine in immortalized fibroblasts and tumor cell lines do not have methylated promoters [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518908"&gt;518908&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518910"&gt;518910&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571686"&gt;571686&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Hence, promoter methylation is not a pre-requisite for decitabine-induced gene re-expression. This suggests that methylated upstream genes could secondarily reactivate downstream non-methylated genes, or alternatively that decitabine is acting through mechanisms other than demethylation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518908"&gt;518908&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553897"&gt;553897&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Using microarray technology it is now possible to screen &amp;gt; 10,000 genes for expression. Studies in fibroblasts and tumor cell lines demonstrated that decitabine induced 85 genes in Li-Fraumeni immortalized fibroblasts [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518910"&gt;518910&lt;/ulink&gt;], 51 genes in colon cancer cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553897"&gt;553897&lt;/ulink&gt;], 61 genes in bladder cancer cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518908"&gt;518908&lt;/ulink&gt;], and 83 genes in an acute myeloid leukemia cell line [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571686"&gt;571686&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This is important because much of the research into decitabine and other demethylating agents has focussed on genes with hypermethylated promoters. The overall changes in gene expression are more complicated than those predicted by hypermethylated genes. It should also be noted that decitabine can downregulate the expression of many genes as well [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518908"&gt;518908&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Decitabine also induced expression of 30 genes in normal bronchial cell lines that were already expressed de novo in untreated lung cancer cells, suggesting that there is a novel group of genes induced by genome-wide hypomethylation that could act as dominant oncogenes [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="532189"&gt;532189&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Many genes silenced by methylation have shown reactivation following exposure to decitabine (see [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503319"&gt;503319&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518855"&gt;518855&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518858"&gt;518858&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518861"&gt;518861&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518949"&gt;518949&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553897"&gt;553897&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553920"&gt;553920&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553925"&gt;553925&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553979"&gt;553979&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570102"&gt;570102&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570114"&gt;570114&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571518"&gt;571518&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571520"&gt;571520&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571521"&gt;571521&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571524"&gt;571524&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571525"&gt;571525&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571686"&gt;571686&lt;/ulink&gt;]). These genes include many which are relevant for tumorigenesis and include tumor suppressor genes and genes affecting the cell cycle via inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases such as p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p21waf1, and the retinoblastoma gene. Gene re-expression has been detected in a variety of cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518897"&gt;518897&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518900"&gt;518900&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518909"&gt;518909&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518924"&gt;518924&lt;/ulink&gt;], and in bone-marrow cells from decitabine-treated patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="468459"&gt;468459&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Inactivation of other relevant genes include those related to inhibition of apoptosis, repair of DNA, cellular adhesion and hence metastatic potential, hormonal responsiveness, multidrug resistance, angiogenesis and tumor antigen expression. Restoration of tumor suppressor genes and DNA mismatch repair genes such as hMLH1 and MGMT could be particularly important in preventing the evolution of malignancy from premalignant lesions. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers and approximately half of all tumors contain inactivating mutations [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553901"&gt;553901&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The promoter region of p53 does not contain a defined CpG island and so silencing of p53 by CpG island hypermethylation does not occur. However, isolated CpG dinucleotides are present in the p53 promoter and recent reports indicate that methylation of these CpG dinucleotides is associated with reduced gene expression in breast cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553903"&gt;553903&lt;/ulink&gt;], hepatocellular cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553905"&gt;553905&lt;/ulink&gt;], and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553908"&gt;553908&lt;/ulink&gt;]. p53 can also be silenced indirectly by methylation-mediated silencing of the tumor-suppressor gene p14ARF [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553916"&gt;553916&lt;/ulink&gt;]. p16INK4A is the second most frequently affected gene in human cancer and is often silenced by methylation in all common human cancers [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553920"&gt;553920&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553924"&gt;553924&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553925"&gt;553925&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It is notable that, although p16INK4A is inactivated by homozygous deletion in many cancers, this mechanism rarely or never occurs in colon and prostate cancers, in which case methylation-induced silencing is the most important mechanism [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553924"&gt;553924&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This is important since methylation is potentially involved in the two most commonly disrupted pathways in cancer, p53 and the Rb/p16INK4A/cyclin D pathways.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Methylation of genes in cancer shows distinct patterns or profiles in discreet cancer subtypes. For example, p15INK4B methylation is very common in acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia and advanced MDS, but is uncommon in lymphoma, and is not seen in CML. In contrast, p16INK4A methylation is rare in acute leukemia, but is common in lymphoma, and both p15INK4B and p16INK4A are frequently methylated in myeloma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570102"&gt;570102&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Hypermethylation profiles of gene promoters in a range of tumor types have been reported, including hematological malignancies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518910"&gt;518910&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570102"&gt;570102&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570105"&gt;570105&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570110"&gt;570110&lt;/ulink&gt;], chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570114"&gt;570114&lt;/ulink&gt;], myeloma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570122"&gt;570122&lt;/ulink&gt;], and a number of solid tumors, including prostate [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570124"&gt;570124&lt;/ulink&gt;] and colon cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553897"&gt;553897&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In one study 15 major tumor subtypes were analysed for methylation profiles for 12 tumor-associated genes [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553920"&gt;553920&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Methylation expression profiles may be an important way to predict response to demethylating agents and should be included in future analysis of decitabine responses.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Reversal of DNA methylation has been demonstrated in cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518895"&gt;518895&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553925"&gt;553925&lt;/ulink&gt;] and leukemic cells from patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518893"&gt;518893&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In one ex vivo study of 21 high-risk MDS patients, hypermethylation of the tumor suppressor gene p15INK4B was reversed in those responding to decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="432872"&gt;432872&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="468459"&gt;468459&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This study demonstrated that reversal of hypermethylation was due to demethylation of the p15 gene in clonal MDS cells rather than selective killing of the MDS cells and replacement by normal unmethylated cells. At an early treatment timepoint complete persistence of the abnormal karyotype was found, indicating that demethylation occurred in clonal MDS cells, but with further treatment clonal cytogenetic abnormalities disappeared, indicating suppression of clonal MDS cells. Responses were also seen in patients who lacked p15 hypermethylation, however, suggesting that mechanisms other than demethylation of this gene were responsible for the responses. Another study did not, however, show a correlation between response and p15INK4B methylation status [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="525622"&gt;525622&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This study used various low-dose decitabine schedules, ranging from 5 to 20 mg/m2 daily for 10 days every 6 weeks, in 50 patients with various hematological malignancies. This same group did, however, show a correlation when they examined average methylation levels of a range of genes including p15INK4B, H19, HoxA5 and Alu repetitive elements [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="529853"&gt;529853&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The discrepancy between the two studies could be explained by technical limitations of methylation testing, the relatively small numbers of patients, or the fact that the patient groups were not identical and possibly methylation of genes other than p15INK4B are more critical to the response [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="525622"&gt;525622&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;While decitabine inhibits growth of tumor cells, it has no effect on growth of normal fibroblasts in culture, supporting the idea that the drug works through reactivation of growth regulatory genes rather than direct non-specific cytotoxicity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="278485"&gt;278485&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Fibroblasts do however show significant changes in gene expression with decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518908"&gt;518908&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Apart from the ability of decitabine to demethylate and thereby reactivate silenced promoter regions in DNA, recent evidence also supports an action on histone proteins, which also play a major role in the regulation of gene activation and transcription. Histone proteins cooperate with methylated DNA in gene expression, leading to modifications of chromatin structure which, in the closed inactive state, repress gene transcription [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553978"&gt;553978&lt;/ulink&gt;]. One link between DNA methylation and histones is that methylated DNA binds methyl DNA binding proteins such as MeCP2 and the co-repressor Sin3A, which then bind to HDAC forming an enzyme complex which results in deacetylation of lysine residues in histone tails. In the hypoacetylated state lysine is positively charged and the histone binds DNA tightly, thereby preventing access to transcription factors. Methylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 is also associated with the inactive chromatin state [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553978"&gt;553978&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553979"&gt;553979&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Decitabine has been shown to reverse the inactive chromatin state by inducing histone hyperacetylation by a mechanism independent of DNA demethylation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518911"&gt;518911&lt;/ulink&gt;], and two recent studies demonstrate that decitabine can also reduce histone methylation of lysine 9 residues, leading to reactivation of tumor suppressor genes in bladder cancer and colorectal cancer cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518912"&gt;518912&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518913"&gt;518913&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The interplay between DNA methylation and histones suggests that combined inhibitors of DNA methylation and HDAC could be synergistic. This has now been proven in several models, and multiple reports of synergy between decitabine and various HDAC inhibitors have been made. HDAC inhibitors include depsipeptide and trichostatin (TSA) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518915"&gt;518915&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553980"&gt;553980&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571235"&gt;571235&lt;/ulink&gt;], LAQ824 (Novartis AG) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="529849"&gt;529849&lt;/ulink&gt;], and valproic acid [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="529850"&gt;529850&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="532325"&gt;532325&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Combinations of decitabine with TSA and depsipeptide [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518915"&gt;518915&lt;/ulink&gt;] and valproic acid [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="532325"&gt;532325&lt;/ulink&gt;] enhanced the growth inhibitory effects on cultured leukemic cells compared with either agent alone. In combination with valproic acid it increased apoptosis and the reactivation of p57KIP2 and p21CIP1 genes in leukemic cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="532325"&gt;532325&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Valproic acid is particularly interesting because it is already an established drug used in the treatment of epilepsy. In another study on AML1/ETO+ leukemic cells, cytotoxicity, gene expression and differentiation were enhanced by the combination of depsipeptide and decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553984"&gt;553984&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In cultured cells derived from various solid tumors a combination of decitabine and LAQ824 produced a greater inhibition of DNA synthesis than either agent alone [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="529849"&gt;529849&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In another study synergy between decitabine and TSA led to a 300- to 400-fold increase of estrogen receptor (ER) mRNA transcripts, ER protein expression and restoration of estrogen responsiveness in a breast cancer cell line [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553986"&gt;553986&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Combination therapy may allow the use of much lower, and hence less toxic, doses of decitabine and yet achieve the same effect. In colon cancer cell lines low-dose decitabine at 0.1 microM (1/10th of the dose shown to induce gene re-expression) resulted in minimal demethylation and little or no gene reactivation, but when combined with TSA robust expression of MLH1 and TIMP3 occurred; TSA on its own was ineffective [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553980"&gt;553980&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In addition to synergistic effects, decitabine may restore sensitivity to the differentiation-inducing activity of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or vitamin D3. This was demonstrated in leukemic cells with involvement of the MLL (myeloid/lymphoid or mixed lineage leukemia) gene associated with chromosomal translocations of 11q23. Cell lines with MLL translocations that were resistant to the differentiating effects of ATRA or vitamin D3 had sensitivity restored after decitabine treatment. This coincided with re-expression of the p16 gene, suggesting an association between demethylation and the restoration of sensitivity to the differentiating agents [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518918"&gt;518918&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The cause of specific regional DNA hypermethylation in cancers has been difficult to explain, but a recent study using a promyelocytic cell line and patient-derived promyelocytic leukemic cells has revealed one important mechanism [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518920"&gt;518920&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The promyelocytic leukemia fusion gene results in a hybrid gene combining the PML gene and the retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) and the resulting protein functions as a transcriptional regulator of target genes including the putative tumor suppressor gene RARbeta2. It has been shown that PML-RARalpha physically associates with the DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3a (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a), but also associates with the RARbeta2 gene, bringing the DNA methyltransferases into proximity with the RARbeta2 gene and leading to methylation of the RARbeta2 promoter and gene silencing. Decitabine partially restored the RARbeta2 repression, but full restoration was accomplished only by a combination of the HDAC inhibitor TSA and decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518920"&gt;518920&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This landmark study is the first to show a link between a genetic event (gene translocation) and an epigenetic event (hypermethylation) and is thereby a potential mechanism for cell transformation. In another leukemic gene translocation involving the chimeric gene AML1/ETO with the cytogenetic abnormality t(8:21)(q22; q22), gene silencing through DNA methylation and HDAC is also involved in leukemogenesis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518921"&gt;518921&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Restoration of interferon response or expression of interferon-related genes may be another important antitumor effect of decitabine. Major functions of interferon include inhibition of cell growth, regulation of apoptosis, antiviral and immunostimulatory properties [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="329308"&gt;329308&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A high percentage of genes activated by decitabine in culture of tumor cells belong to the interferon-signaling pathway [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518908"&gt;518908&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518910"&gt;518910&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Interestingly, decitabine pretreatment sensitizes colon cancer cell lines to growth inhibition by interferon [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570184"&gt;570184&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This is relevant for studies wanting to explore the antineoplastic activity of interferon in combination with decitabine.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Additive or synergistic effects of decitabine plus &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; have also been demonstrated in CML. When CML cells become resistant to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; through overexpression of the CML gene bcr-abl, or because of mutations in bcr-abl, this does not induce cross-resistance to decitabine. Decitabine synergizes with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; to inhibit CML cell growth, but only as long as at least partial sensitivity to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; is retained. If there is complete resistance to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;, then the combination of low-dose &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; with decitabine can lead to antagonism [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518922"&gt;518922&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The efficacy of decitabine may be enhanced by metabolic inhibitors. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="46779"&gt;Zebularine&lt;/ulink&gt;, an inhibitor of cytidine deaminase and DNA methyltransferase, has been used in combination studies with decitabine in vitro against leukemia cell lines and in-vivo in a mouse leukemia model [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="529881"&gt;529881&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The combination was significantly more effective in preventing leukemic cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, and there was a significantly greater increase in survival time than either agent alone, without additional toxicity. In human leukemic cell lines in culture the combination of decitabine and cytarabine (a non-demethylating pyrimidine nucleoside analog) is antagonistic for growth inhibition, however [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="529854"&gt;529854&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Demethylation of endogenous viral DNA is another potential use for decitabine. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is associated with several human tumors and establishes itself within the human genome in a latent form avoiding immune detection. EBV has utilized DNA methylation to maximize its persistence and cloak itself from immune detection. Demethylating agents can reactivate transcription of immunogenic viral proteins and thus allow reocognition by the immune system. In viral-associated tumors this strategy could make the infected cell vulnerable to immune attack [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570185"&gt;570185&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;One of the first animal models to confirm the anti-leukemic activity of decitabine used mice with the L1210 leukemia. Mice were given decitabine (0.5 to 22 mg/kg) in 15-h infusions [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570186"&gt;570186&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A dose-dependent reduction in total DNA methylation was noted, as was a dose-dependent potent anti-leukemic effect. This was the first study to identify a correlation between the anti-leukemic action of decitabine and it ability to demethylate DNA. In another murine model of leukemia, decitabine increased life span by 50 to 212% compared with control animals [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518942"&gt;518942&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Comparative studies were then performed against cytosine arabinoside in mouse leukemia models and showed that using equimolar concentratrions of the two drugs that decitabine produced greater toxicity against the leukemia. At the MTDs decitabine produced a much greater increase in lifespan than cytosine arabinoside [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570187"&gt;570187&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Decitabine also appears to be more potent than cytarabine in a rat model of human AML [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382227"&gt;382227&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further murine studies evaluated decitabine in the treatment of intracerebral leukemia, to see if it could cross into the CNS as predicted by pharmacologic studies. In mice with intracerebral L1210 leukemia, decitabine was compared with cytosine arabinoside. At equitoxic doses decitabine showed significant increase in lifespan and more 60-day survivors than cytosine arabinoside [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570189"&gt;570189&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Several animal models have evaluated the potential carcinogenicity of decitabine, and this has also been contrasted with the related demethylating agent 5-azacytidine. Early studies indicated that 5-azacytidine was carcinogenic in male Fischer rats [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519170"&gt;519170&lt;/ulink&gt;], but in a follow-up comparative study no excess tumors were found in rats treated with decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519171"&gt;519171&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Indeed, the majority of preclinical studies with decitabine have suggested a chemopreventative rather than carcinogenic effect. Decitabine reduced the incidence of mouse lung cancers in a tobacco carcinogen model and this benefit was further enhanced by the addition of the HDAC inhibitor sodium &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="12202"&gt;phenylbutyrate&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553963"&gt;553963&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Decitabine also prevented primary lung cancers in a mouse chemical carcinogenesis model [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518926"&gt;518926&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a mouse model of intestinal neoplasia using mice with the Apcmin mutation which predisposes to intestinal cancer, weekly doses of decitabine were able to reduce the average number of intestinal adenomas from 113 in controls to two in treated animals, but note that the mice also had a mutation of the DNA methyltransferase enzyme causing a pre-existing state of genomic hypomethylation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518934"&gt;518934&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A similar protective effect occurred without decitabine use, but in mice with genomic hypomethylation solely due to mutated hypomorphic DNA methyltransferase enzymes [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553964"&gt;553964&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Other evidence points to a possible carcinogenic risk of decitabine. In drosophila larvae, decitabine and cytarabine both cause somatic mutations [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518925"&gt;518925&lt;/ulink&gt;], and decitabine also caused mutations in an E Coli gene in colonic mucosal cells in a transgenic mouse model [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570190"&gt;570190&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In contrast to the previous studies, the induction of mice with hypomethylated DNA through DNA methyltransferase mutations and co-existent mutations of the p53 and neurofibromatosis genes resulted in chromosomal instability and earlier onset of sarcomas than control mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553990"&gt;553990&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition, mice with severely reduced DNA methyltransferase levels of ~ 10% of normal levels develop T-cell lymphomas in association with trisomy chromosome 15 by 4 to 8 months of age [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553988"&gt;553988&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The relevance to human studies, however, remains unclear since these studies are in manipulated animal models, and whether or not such effects will be seen in humans can only be proven in clinical studies. The risk of carcinogenicity must also be seen in the context that many antineoplastic agents in current use are known carcinogens, but the risk benefit still favors their use.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Although reactivation of silenced tumor suppressor genes may be advantageous, it is possible that decitabine could also reactivate deleterious genes by similar mechanisms. In cell-culture experiments, decitabine increased the expression of the multidrug resistance gene MDR1. Potentially this could induce resistance to chemotherapy agents [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518936"&gt;518936&lt;/ulink&gt;], although a contrasting view has also been put forward [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518937"&gt;518937&lt;/ulink&gt;]. For example, some studies have demonstrated downregulation of MDR1 by decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553956"&gt;553956&lt;/ulink&gt;], and clinical experience with patients treated with decitabine in trials for MDS and leukemia have not suggested a higher rate of drug resistance when subsequently treated with chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518937"&gt;518937&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, several other genes and proteins associated with enhanced cancer-cell proliferation, invasiveness and metastatic potential are also upregulated by decitabine. These include gamma-synuclein, involved in breast and ovarian carcinoma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518938"&gt;518938&lt;/ulink&gt;], galectin-7, associated with an aggressive phenotype in lymphoma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518939"&gt;518939&lt;/ulink&gt;], matrix metalloproteinase in pancreatic cell cancer invasiveness [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518940"&gt;518940&lt;/ulink&gt;], and activation of heparanase production associated with tumor invasion and vascularization [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518941"&gt;518941&lt;/ulink&gt;]. An interesting dilemma appears in association with the methylation-mediated inactivation of the key DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in some cancers [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553951"&gt;553951&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This enzyme normally protects against mutagenic DNA adducts and in its absence it predisposes to point mutations in tumor-suppressor genes such as p53 and oncogenes like K-ras. However, it also is responsible for DNA repair following alkylating agent chemotherapy and so in its absence cancer cells are more susceptible to chemotherapy. Restoration of MGMT activity following decitabine is a two edged sword, with possible reductions in new tumor mutations, but at the cost of decreased chemotherapy sensitivity.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics&lt;/subtitle&gt;Decitabine is unstable in solution and in alkaline solution undergoes rapid reversible decomposition to N-(formylamidino)-N'-beta-D-2-deoxyribofuranosylurea, which decomposes irreversibly to 1-beta-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl-3-guanylurea. It is unstable in acid pH, which may contribute to poor oral absorption, and is most stable when stored in neutral solution at low temperature [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553949"&gt;553949&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At pH 7 and 37degC ~ 7% conversion occurs in 1 h [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553947"&gt;553947&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Hence during clinical studies drug infusions were replaced with fresh stock every 8 to 12 h.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Following intraperitoneal injection in mice decitabine shows highest incorporation into the spleen and thymus. Metabolic conversion to the active form via deoxycytidine kinase occurred predominantly in the spleen, but the inactive deaminated product occurs predominantly in the liver, which has a higher level of cytidine deaminase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518853"&gt;518853&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553947"&gt;553947&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Decitabine has low ionization at physiological pH and low protein binding, which would favor CNS penetration, but its low lipid solubility would inhibit CNS penetration. However, the drug does cross the blood/brain barrier in dogs and rabbits with CSF concentrations of 58 and 27% of plateau plasma concentrations, respectively, following an intravenous bolus [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553940"&gt;553940&lt;/ulink&gt;]. CSF concentrations in an early pediatric leukemia study measured in two patients 1.25 and 2 h post infusion of 10 mg/kg decitabine over 30 min were 0.2 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519144"&gt;519144&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In mice following decitabine administration (10 or 100 mg/kg iv) the plasma decitabine concentration declined in a tri-exponential manner with an intermediate elimination t1/2 of 31 min. Urinary clearance accounted for 28.5% of plasma clearance. In vivo antitumor responses were dependent on exposure time with intravenous infusions or multiple doses giving greater cytotoxic effects than single bolus doses. The critical cytotoxic concentration was estimated to be 0.5 to 1.0 microg/ml [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518942"&gt;518942&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The elimination t1/2 varies across animal species. In rabbits the intermediate t1/2beta is 43 min, which compares with 75 min in dogs and 29 to 32 min in mice. Volumes of distribution are similar to total body water [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553940"&gt;553940&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase I pharmacokinetic study in cancer patients, patients with advanced solid tumors (n = 21) received seven separate dose levels of decitabine ranging from 25 to 100 mg/m2. Treatment was administered as three 1-h infusions separated by intervals of 7 h and repeated every 3 to 6 weeks. For the 75 and 100 mg/m2 doses, mean peak plasma concentrations were 0.93 and 2.01 microM, respectively. In seven of nine courses at lower dose levels (25 to 60 mg/m2) the plasma decitabine concentration was &amp;lt; 0.01 microM. Following cessation of infusion, the drug disappeared rapidly from the plasma with an observed t1/2alpha of 7 min and t1/2beta of 35 min. The high clearance and total urinary excretion of &amp;lt; 1% indicate that decitabine is rapidly metabolized [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382238"&gt;382238&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Decitabine is metabolized via nucleoside activation and degradation enzymes. It is initially activated from the monophosphate form via phosphorylation to the active triphospate form in a reaction catalysed by deoxycytidine kinase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553936"&gt;553936&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Cytosine arabinoside shares the same pathway and so it is not surprising that the two drugs are antagonistic for growth inhibition of human leukemia cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="529854"&gt;529854&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Once decitabine is in the triphosphate form, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate, it is incorporated into DNA by DNA polymerase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553933"&gt;553933&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Decitabine is inactivated by deamination through cytidine deaminase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518863"&gt;518863&lt;/ulink&gt;] and shows a Km value of 250 microM which is considerably higher than the natural substrate cytidine which has a Km value of 12 microM.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;There are two aspects to the toxicity of this drug. One is the toxicity that is encountered in clinical trials, discussed in the Side Effects and Contraindications section, and the other is the potential carcinogenic effects of the DNA methylation inhibitors, as covered in the Preclinical section. Decitabine exhibits toxicity similar to other cytotoxic agents. In mice the LD50 for male and female CD2F1 mice were 29.5 and 22.2 mg/kg respectively. At toxic doses decitabine produces leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and weight loss. Toxic effects were reversible, but leukopenia was exceptionally prolonged and was still present 43 days post treatment. Histopathological studies following doses close to the LD50 produced bone marrow hypoplasia, necrosis of the small intestinal mucosa, and atrophy of the thymus and testes. All these toxic effects were reversible [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="553931"&gt;553931&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I/II&lt;/subtitle&gt;The optimal dose schedule for decitabine remains unclear, but recent studies are now focusing on doses 30-fold lower than the MTD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="525622"&gt;525622&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Most studies have used the intravenous route, but recent experience demonstrates that a subcutaneous route may also be satisfactory [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="501709"&gt;501709&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518862"&gt;518862&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Studies in patients with AML, ALL and MDS achieved target decitabine plasma levels of 0.1 to 1.0 microM following decitabine doses in the range of 20 to 200 mg/m2 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518863"&gt;518863&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although prolonged exposure increased antitumor activity, clinical experience showed that 72 h was the longest that doses of decitabine could be given to achieve levels of 0.1 to 1.0 microM without causing severe hematological toxicity. The time-course of myelotoxicity was unusually delayed compared with other typical cytotoxic drugs. The nadir of the white cell count occurred at 3 to 4 weeks and recovered at 5 weeks [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382238"&gt;382238&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A low-dose, continuous-infusion schedule was recently evaluated [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518949"&gt;518949&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients with advanced melanoma, breast, kidney, colon and bladder cancer (n = 19) were given decitabine (20, 30, and 40 mg/m2/day) by continuous intravenous infusion over 72 h with courses repeated every 28 days. Steady-state decitabine levels of 0.1 to 0.2 microM were achieved at the 30 and 40 mg/m2 dose levels and grade 4 neutropenia occurred in two of five patients given 40 mg/m2. Tumor tissue biopsies were taken before and 7 days after starting treatment. No objective responses were seen and real-time PCR analysis of 16 different genes showed that although changes in gene methylation were observed, no single gene consistently demonstrated evidence of demethylation. The optimal dose level was determined to be 30 mg/m2 per day as a 72-h intravenous infusion. The authors concluded that a schedule of 3 days may be insufficient to induce demethylation and planned a study of low-dose daily decitabine over a 4-week period to address the hypothesis that prolonged exposure of tumor cells may more effectively result in demethylation and upregulation of gene expression [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="409904"&gt;409904&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518949"&gt;518949&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Consideration of classical pharmacokinetics may not be sufficient to guide the optimal administration of decitabine. Since demethylation of DNA is time-dependent and requires two to three cell cycles to be effective, then some of the effects of decitabine will be delayed [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518949"&gt;518949&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518952"&gt;518952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. If chemosensitization is the goal of decitabine treatment, then concomitant administration of chemotherapy is unlikely to be effective. A recent study evaluated the pharmacodynamic responses to decitabine in mice and humans [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518952"&gt;518952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this phase I trial of decitabine plus &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44383"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt;, levels of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine and demethylation of the MAGE-1a promoter were measured in peripheral mononuclear cells and buccal smears. Decitabine was infused at 45 to 90 mg/m2 for 6 h. Maximum effects were not reached until 8 to 12 days after decitabine infusion and returned to initial levels by day 21 post treatment. Hence, antitumor strategies taking advantage of altered gene regulation may need to sequence therapy after an appropriate delay. Such a strategy was recently employed in a phase I trial of patients with advanced solid tumors who received decitabine on day 1 starting at 45 mg/m2 and escalating to 135 mg/m2, followed by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44383"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; at a fixed dose of AUC5 on day 8. Fourteen patients were treated and the MTD for decitabine was determined as 135 mg/m2 due to grade 4 febrile neutropenia. Pharmacodynamic studies showed that the maximum reduction of methylated cytosine in DNA of blood mononuclear cells was between days 8 and 12, as predicted by earlier studies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="542917"&gt;542917&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In view of the results of this study, it is possible that the 7 days post-treatment biopsy used in the previous study was too early to detect methylation changes in the tumor since 8 to 12 days was determined as the optimal time to see demethylation in blood mononuclear cells.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Even lower doses over a longer period of time might capitalize on the gene regulatory effects of decitabine rather than relying on the cytotoxic effects. The MD Anderson Cancer group reported a very low dose schedule of 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/m2 decitabine given daily given intravenously for 5 days per week for 2 weeks and repeated approximately every 6 weeks. Two groups also received 15 mg/m2 for 15 or 20 days. The lowest dose was 30-fold lower than the reported MTD. An initial report included 39 patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503340"&gt;503340&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These results have been updated on 50 patients and confirm the effectiveness of the low-dose schedule [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="525622"&gt;525622&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patient groups included 44 with AML/MDS, five with CML and one with ALL. Ages ranged from 2 to 84 years. Poor-prognosis patients included 30 with refractory/relapsed AML, four with high-risk MDS and three blastic-phase CML patients. Treatment was well tolerated at all dose levels, with myelosuppression and febrile neutropenia the main side effect. Interestingly, severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia did not occur in all patients, and in ten courses analysed for myelosuppression in a subset of six patients, neutrophils did not drop below 1.0 x 10(9)/l in three courses, nor were platelet counts &amp;lt; 100 x 10(9)/l in four courses. Recovery of neutrophils &amp;gt; 1.0 x 10(9)/l and platelets &amp;gt; 100 x 10(9)/l was characteristically prolonged at median recovery times of 36 and 32 days respectively. The overall response rate was 32%. In 37 patients with AML, five (14%) achieved complete remission (CR) and three (8%) showed a partial remission (PR). In seven MDS patient, two (29%) achieved CR and two (29%) achieved PR. Two of five CML patients achieved CR. The optimal dose chosen from analysis of the multiple cohorts was 15 mg/m2 daily for 10 days. These responses were based on relatively small numbers, ie up to 11 patients in each group, but the dose chosen for future studies included 17 patients in total. An interesting aspect to this study is the bone marrow analysis, which showed very few patients with hypoplastic marrows, suggesting that cytotoxicity is not the primary mechanism of action of decitabine. p15INK4B levels have been shown to correlate with response [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="468459"&gt;468459&lt;/ulink&gt;], but in this study there was no correlation.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Acute leukemia&lt;br/&gt;In 1981, an early pediatric, acute leukemia phase I study used decitabine (36 to 80 mg/kg) infused over 36 to 44 h, and achieved clearance of marrow blasts in two out of nine children with refractory leukemia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519144"&gt;519144&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Meningeal leukemia cleared in two patients, confirming CNS penetration by decitabine. In 1985, the same group reported a phase I/II study of relapsed leukemia patients, again predominantly pediatric, using decitabine (37 to 67 mg/kg) at an infusion rate of 1 mg/kg/h. CR was achieved in two of six patients with AML and four of 21 patients with ALL [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519145"&gt;519145&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Of particular note is that almost all patients had previously received cytarabine, which is important since resistance to cytarabine confers resistance to decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="218901"&gt;218901&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258476"&gt;258476&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258479"&gt;258479&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258496"&gt;258496&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The resistant phenotype is associated with a functional deficiency of the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="218901"&gt;218901&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="218902"&gt;218902&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 12 patients unsuitable for chemotherapy due to age or comorbidity and given decitabine over 3 days, for a total dose of 1080 mg/m2 per course, three achieved CR [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258500"&gt;258500&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258502"&gt;258502&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Four elderly patients with AML transformed from MDS received 135 mg/m2 decitabine over 3 days and all responded, with two CR, one of which was ongoing at 17 months. The authors commented particularly on the tolerability and minimalization of hospitalization [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503324"&gt;503324&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Attempts to improve the response rate in acute leukemia by combining decitabine with chemotherapy have also been performed. Only small studies have been carried out so far, and although response rates may be improved, toxicity is also increased and overall conclusions are limited by the small size of the studies. Combinations have included decitabine plus amsacrine in 11 patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382039"&gt;382039&lt;/ulink&gt;], daunorubicin in eight patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258480"&gt;258480&lt;/ulink&gt;], and 63 patients received either idarubicin or amsacrine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258486"&gt;258486&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Responses ranged from 27 to 100% with better responses in de novo patients, and poor responses in patients refractory to cytosine arabinoside, which causes cross resistance to decitabine.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase II European study of low-dose decitabine (135 mg/m2) administered over 3 days is currently in progress in elderly AML [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571670"&gt;571670&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This study is also combining ATRA with decitabine based on in vitro data showing reactivation of the retinoic acid pathway in non-promyelocytic leukemia cells. Results are preliminary, but responses are ~ 20 to 30% [M Lubbert, personal communication].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Chronic myelogenous leukemia&lt;br/&gt;CML appears to be particularly responsive to decitabine. One possible mechanism for this is the known hypermethylation of the Pa promoter of the abl oncogene, and its association with more advanced phases [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519252"&gt;519252&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The extensive experience of staff at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, spanning ten years and involving 130 patients with CML in various phases, was recently reported [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="278488"&gt;278488&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503308"&gt;503308&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Gradually reduced decitabine dose schedules from 1000 down to 500 mg/m2 over 5 days were used as the effectiveness of lower doses with less toxicity became appreciated. Although myelosuppression was common, and febrile episodes occurred in 37% of patients, only four patients (3%) died during the first course from complications of myelosuppression. Sixty-four patients had CML in blastic phase, of whom 18 (28%) achieved objective responses, including six complete hematological remissions. Fifty-one patients had accelerated phase, of whom 28 (55%) achieved objective responses, including 12 complete hematological remissions. Five out of eight chronic phase patients (63%) had objective responses. Cytogenetic responses were seen in all phases. Apart from severe myelosuppression, no other significant non-hematological toxicities were observed. Interestingly, there was no evidence of a dose-response effect, once again suggesting that decitabine is not only working by cytotoxic mechanisms. In fact, in accelerated phase, higher doses of decitabine were an adverse prognostic factor.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The kinetics of the time to best response were notable because of the prolonged time required, a median of three courses, parallelling the results in MDS [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387071"&gt;387071&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The MD Anderson Cancer Center also reported separately their experience for 162 patients with CML in non-lymphoid blastic phase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387073"&gt;387073&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this report they compared historical results of decitabine treatment with the results of other first salvage therapies, including intensive chemotherapy or other single agents (&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4577"&gt;topotecan&lt;/ulink&gt;, high-dose infusional hydroxyurea, mithramycin, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3100"&gt;fazarabine&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3106"&gt;tallimustine&lt;/ulink&gt; or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="10854"&gt;homoharringtonine&lt;/ulink&gt;). Decitabine was administered according to the schedule reported for the 130 patients above [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503308"&gt;503308&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Response rates were similar with decitabine (26%) versus intensive chemotherapy (28%), and superior to other single agents (7%). There were no early deaths in decitabine-treated patients and decitabine treatment showed a trend toward better survival, despite an older average age in this group. When considering only patients &gt;/= 50 years old, survival was significantly better with decitabine compared with intensive chemotherapy (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Although this study was not randomized, the results remain impressive, since the bias is likely to be against decitabine, which included older and potentially more frail patients than the intensive chemotherapy group [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387073"&gt;387073&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Finally, a low-dose schedule using decitabine (15 mg/m2/day) administered for 10 days produced responses in two out of two CML patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503340"&gt;503340&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A logical step is to combine decitabine with other active agents. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; is now recognized as one of the most active agents in CML, and a phase II study combining decitabine with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; in CML was initiated in mid-2003 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="493569"&gt;493569&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients are to receive oral &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; daily and intravenous decitabine over 1 h daily, 5 days per week, for 2 consecutive weeks. Courses will repeat every 4 to 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [&lt;ulink url="www.clinicaltrials.gov"&gt;www.clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A number of phase II trials in CML have also been initiated in patients who are refractory to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink url="www.clinicaltrials.gov"&gt;www.clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation&lt;br/&gt;Decitabine has also been used prior to allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. It is attractive in this setting because of its minimal non-hematological toxicity, yet potent anti-leukemic activity. Fourteen patients who had relapsed following an initial allogeneic stem-cell transplant for advanced acute leukemia or transformed CML received a second transplant following decitabine treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503314"&gt;503314&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Decitabine doses ranged from 100 to 150 mg/m2 every 12 h for 5 days. Eight of fourteen patients responded with complete or partial remission. Toxicity was limited, with no grade 3 or 4 toxicity directly related to decitabine. The median survival was 190 days (range of 11 to 1215+) and five patients were alive 176+ to 1245+ days post transplant, of whom only two were in remission. Interestingly, both long-term remission patients achieved this following donor lymphocyte infusions to induce a graft versus leukemia effect. The authors speculate that the ability of decitabine to induce expression of MHC class I and II molecules on the surface of leukemic cells may enhance the effectiveness of a graft versus leukemia effect [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503314"&gt;503314&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Decitabine has also been used in combination with pre-transplant conditioning chemotherapy. Busulfan plus cyclophosphamide is a commonly used pre-transplant conditioning schedule and was used in combination with high-dose decitabine in a phase I study [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503310"&gt;503310&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This recently reported study gives long-term follow-up of patients with high-risk acute leukemia or CML (n = 23). Cyclophosphamide doses were standard, but busulfan was reduced from the standard 16 to 12 mg/kg for all patients. Decitabine (400 to 800 mg/m2) was given at an escalating-dose schedule. Of the 23 patients, 21 achieved remission. The 100-day mortality was 9% and six patients (26%) were alive and disease free at a median of 3.3 years post transplant. The authors concluded that this combination has a high response rate in a poor-risk group of patients, with low treatment-related mortality.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Myelodysplastic syndrome&lt;br/&gt;Some of the most encouraging results with decitabine are in the treatment of MDS, in particular high-risk MDS. Considerable interest in this area was generated by a positive result for a phase III study of the related analog 5-azacytidine in treatment of MDS [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="505143"&gt;505143&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this study 5-azacytidine was compared with supportive care and showed significantly higher response rates, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic transformation and a trend to improved survival. There was a reasonable expectation, therefore, that decitabine would produce similar results. The current status of methylation inhibitors in MDS and elderly AML has recently been reviewed by Ruter et al [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="570198"&gt;570198&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Phase I/II studies showed that decitabine has significant activity in MDS. The first study in 1993 treated ten MDS patients, with doses of 135 mg/m2 to 150 mg/m2 and improvements in Hb, white cells and neutrophils occurred in 50% of the patients. Most experience of decitabine treatment of MDS comes from a Netherlands/Belgium/Germany-based group who reported their experience of 66 patients in 1997 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258487"&gt;258487&lt;/ulink&gt;], and again in 2000 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387071"&gt;387071&lt;/ulink&gt;], later updated with data from a further 169 patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503355"&gt;503355&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The patient groups included those with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and patients with RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) if they were transfusion dependent. Patients were also classified according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for MDS which scores the number of prognostic risk factors (see [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519148"&gt;519148&lt;/ulink&gt;]). A low score of zero has a median survival of 5 to 6 years, but a high score of &amp;gt; 2.5 has a median survival of only 0.4 months. This scoring system enabled the evaluation of the efficacy of decitabine in various risk groups, including intermediate I (n = 48), intermediate II (n = 50) and high-risk (n = 71) groups. Patients (median age of 70 years) received decitabine (45 or 50 mg/m2/day) for 3 days, repeated every 6 weeks to a maximum of eight cycles. Complete response criteria included recovery of hemoglobin &amp;gt; 11 g/dl, granulocytes &amp;gt; 1.0 x 10(9)/l, platelets &amp;gt; 100 x 10(9)/l, and blast percentage in bone marrow &amp;lt; 5%. Partial responses, improvement, stable disease and disease progression were also separately defined [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387071"&gt;387071&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The response rate was 49% (CR in 20% of patients) and non-hematological toxicity was minimal. Myelosuppression was the main side effect and seven patients developed fatal infection or bleeding related either to treatment or the disease or both. Interestingly, similar responses occurred across all risk groups as well as age groups. Patients above 75 years had the same response as those below 65 years, and this probably reflects the minimal non-hematological toxicity. Also important is that patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities had the same response rate (48%). Normalization of cytogenetics was seen even in patients with high-risk abnormalities. Major cytogenetic responses were observed in 31% of those with abnormal cytogenetics and were associated with improved survival compared with patients in whom the cytogenetic abnormalities persisted [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503315"&gt;503315&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A remarkable finding was a rise in platelet counts even after the first cycle, which occurred in 63% of patients who received at least two cycles [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387071"&gt;387071&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503355"&gt;503355&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This may be a unique action of decitabine separate from the action on MDS since a rise in platelets is also seen when decitabine is used for sickle cell anemia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503328"&gt;503328&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The median duration of response for 82 evaluable patients was 40 weeks and median survival was 15 months with a two-year survival of 34%. Poorer prognosis was seen with a high-risk IPSS score, high blast count, high lactate dehydrogenase and higher age. Interestingly, high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities were not a risk factor for survival. The authors concluded that decitabine is an effective drug for MDS, and because of minimal non-hematological toxicity can be used even in very elderly patients. A follow up report from this group found a particularly beneficial effect on platelet counts [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="548217"&gt;548217&lt;/ulink&gt;]. During therapy, 69% of patients with a low platelet count showed an improvement in platelet numbers, and this strongly predicted for overall survival. Interestingly, no correlation was found between the platelet response and the number of megakaryocytes in the marrow or the serum thrombopoietin level.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Re-treatment with decitabine in patients previously responsive to decitabine is possible and, although responses are less, 45% of patients with MDS showed objective responses, but the 2nd remissions were markedly shorter [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571674"&gt;571674&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The authors suggest that decitabine responsive patients might benefit from continuation of the initial treatment.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Solid tumors&lt;br/&gt;Decitabine was first studied in solid tumors more than 15 years ago, initial reports appearing in 1986 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382238"&gt;382238&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Various infusion schedules have been tested, including multiple infusions per day and continuous infusion. Since then several preclinical and clinical studies have been performed in a range of cancers including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="358098"&gt;358098&lt;/ulink&gt;], ovarian cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="21908"&gt;21908&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="416073"&gt;416073&lt;/ulink&gt;], colon cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382222"&gt;382222&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="416073"&gt;416073&lt;/ulink&gt;], head and neck cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382222"&gt;382222&lt;/ulink&gt;], melanoma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382222"&gt;382222&lt;/ulink&gt;], kidney cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382222"&gt;382222&lt;/ulink&gt;], prostate cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="375751"&gt;375751&lt;/ulink&gt;], cancer of the cervix [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519150"&gt;519150&lt;/ulink&gt;], and testicular cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382038"&gt;382038&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In an EORTC report of 101 patients with colon, renal and head and neck cancer, and melanoma, treated with decitabine (75 mg/m2) given every 8 h for three doses and repeated every 5 to 8 weeks, only one of 18 patients with untreated melanoma had a partial response. No responses were seen in the other diseases and stable disease occurred in &amp;lt; 20% of patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382222"&gt;382222&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Combinations of decitabine plus cisplatin in carcinoma of the cervix show significant hematological toxicity, but achieved partial responses in 38% [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503311"&gt;503311&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Metastatic NSCLC studies were pursued because colony assays showed a potent antineoplastic effect in two human lung carcinoma cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258475"&gt;258475&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Using a higher dose of decitabine (200 to 600 mg/m2) administered over 8 h every 5 to 6 weeks, 15 patients with metastatic stage 4 NSCLC were treated. Median survival was 6.7 months with three patients surviving &amp;gt; 15 months, although no objective responses were seen [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258475"&gt;258475&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Nevertheless, the authors reported that probability of survival for patients who received two or more treatments was &amp;gt; 15 months and longer than expected with other standard care treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="358098"&gt;358098&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The interest in this area has been sustained by a follow-up report indicating one patient has become a long-term survivor of up to 81 months [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503312"&gt;503312&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This is considered highly unusual in someone with stage 4 NSCLC. The authors speculate that the unique mechanisms of action of decitabine (ie, demethylation) could reverse tumorigenic genes allowing long-term survival.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Sickle cell anemia&lt;br/&gt;The activity of decitabine in sickle cell anemia is possibly one of the most widely applicable uses for this drug. As early as 1982 the DNA demethylating agents 5-azacytidine and decitabine were found to be powerful inducers of HbF synthesis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="263434"&gt;263434&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519164"&gt;519164&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although phase I trials of 5-azacytidine in 1983 reported increased HbF production [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519169"&gt;519169&lt;/ulink&gt;], studies with this compound were abandoned because preclinical results from rats indicated an increased incidence of tumors. A subsequent report using decitabine showed that this analog was non-tumorigenic, and may actually inhibit cancer development in this model. Considering the lack of sufficient evidence for carcinogenesis from decitabine and the 25% failure rate for hydroxyurea in sickle cell anemia, investigators evaluated decitabine in a phase I/II study and reported the results in 2000 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="391461"&gt;391461&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="394138"&gt;394138&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Eight adult patients with sickle cell anemia who had failed to respond to hydroxyurea received decitabine (0.15 to 0.3 mg/kg iv) over 4 to 7 min, 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Toxicity was minimal and no patients experienced nausea or vomiting. All patients had a fall in neutrophils with a nadir of 32% of baseline at 6 weeks and two patients had absolute neutropenia to &amp;lt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l. Four patients had neutrophil counts &amp;lt; 1.0 x 10(9)/l, but this lasted only 1 to 3 days and none developed fever or an infection. All patients responded with significant increases in HbF, with an average rise from 3.55% pre-treatment to 13.45% post-treatment. This was accompanied by a total hemoglobin increase of 1 g/dl in six of eight patients. Although not designed to test efficacy on clinical events from the disease, no patients developed any sickle cell disease-related events during the study. Interestingly, patients developed a thrombocytosis with treatment peaking at 220% of the baseline 5 weeks after start of treatment.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A follow-up study evaluated the effect of repeated decitabine dosing on HbF levels and hematologic toxicity over a 9-month period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="453903"&gt;453903&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Six adults with sickle cell anemia and one with alpha-thalassemia sickle cell anemia received decitabine (0.3 mg/kg/day) for 5 days per week for 2 weeks, followed by a 4-week observation period. The 2-week cycle was repeated and doses were reduced for subsequent cycles if neutropenia occurred. Five of seven patients had failed hydroxyurea treatment. Each patient had a drug dose calculated to avoid neutropenia, but result in HbF elevation. All six of the sickle cell anemia patients responded with increased HbF (averaging 3.12 to 13.93%) and increased mean hemoglobin (7.23 to 8.81 g/dl). No non-hematological toxicities or cumulative hematological toxicies were seen. In one patient with poor venous access the drug was given subcutaneously, which was well tolerated and associated with equally good treatment response. Significant rises in platelet counts were seen as in the previous study.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the most recent study, decitabine was evaluated by the subcutaneous route in eight symptomatic sickle cell disease patients who were resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518862"&gt;518862&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Decitabine (0.2 mg/kg) was given one to three times per week for 6 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week interval and a second 6-week cycle. The dose frequency in cycle two was adjusted from twice-weekly injections to once or three times weekly, depending on the percentage of HbF-containing cells during cycle one. All patients responded with increased HbF, increased HbF-containing red cells, increased hemoglobin and reduced hemolysis. The study also measured markers of coagulation activation, endothelial damage and inflammation, all of which are markers of the vascular damage associated with sickle cell disease. Decitabine treatment was associated with an improvement in these parameters. Three patients developed neutropenia to &amp;lt; 1.0 x 10(9)/l, but no patients developed infection, and no significant non-hematologic toxicity occurred. Platelet counts increased in all patients with the highest level reaching 877 x 10(9)/l. Most interesting was the finding in serial bone marrow aspirates in four patients that decreased marrow cell numbers was not seen. In fact, increased megakaryocyte numbers were seen in all patients. Studies of gamma-globin gene promoter showed progressive demethylation with each cycle of treatment. These findings strongly suggest that decitabine is not acting as a cytotoxic agent, but via methylation changes and reactivation of the silenced gamma-globin gene.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;Two studies have been initiated in MDS comparing decitabine with current 'standard of care' (antibiotics, growth factors and/or transfusions). Analysis of a North American study involving 170 patients (89 and 81 patients randomized to decitabine and standard of care, respectively) was performed after 92 patients reached the primary endpoint of either progression to AML or death. Median time to progression to AML or death in decitabine-treated patients was 338 days compared with 263 days in patients who received supportive care (p = 0.042 Wilcoxon test, p = 0.198 log-rank test). Decitabine-treated patients had an overall response rate of 22% (nine complete responses and 11 partial responses) compared with 0% in patients on supportive care only (p &amp;lt; 0.001 Fisher exact test). These results were expected to form the basis of an NDA [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="530064"&gt;530064&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A subset analysis showed that 17% of chronic myelomonocytis leukemia patients, 25% of RA patients, 26% of RAEB patients, 29% of RAEB -T patients and 14% of RARS patients achieved a positive response with decitabine treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="540057"&gt;540057&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An ongoing European study with a projected enrolment of 220 patients is assessing low-dose decitabine versus standard supportive care in elderly patients with MDS [&lt;ulink url="www.clinicaltrials.gov"&gt;www.clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Decitabine is administered intravenously over 4 h every 8 h for 3 days and treatment is repeated every 6 weeks for four to eight courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A comparative study between decitabine and 5-azacytidine in MDS would be desirable, but so far no formal studies have been reported. A clinical symposia report, however, commented that a study comparing decitabine with 5-azacytidine in MDS and CML was stopped after enrolling 14 patients, because of an increased number of objective responses in the decitabine arm compared with the 5-azacytidine arm [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="571676"&gt;571676&lt;/ulink&gt;]. There is insufficient information in the report however to fully assess this claim.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;The major toxicity of decitabine is myelosuppression, which is proportional to dose and duration of therapy. The effects are pronounced at high doses (&gt; 200 mg/m2/day), and myelosuppression is enhanced by concomitant administration of other cytotoxic drugs. The time course of the observed myelosuppression is not typical of most cytotoxic drugs, with a delayed onset and recovery at approximately 5 to 6 weeks post treatment. Neutropenic infection and other complications of myelosuppression have proved fatal [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258475"&gt;258475&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258479"&gt;258479&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258480"&gt;258480&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258486"&gt;258486&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258500"&gt;258500&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382238"&gt;382238&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503311"&gt;503311&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Non-hematological side effects have generally been mild, and include nausea, vomiting, mucositis and alopecia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258480"&gt;258480&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="258500"&gt;258500&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="382238"&gt;382238&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503311"&gt;503311&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Decitabine is a novel agent with demonstrated activity in a range of hematological malignancies and sickle cell anemia. Its value in solid tumors is uncertain and results so far have not been particularly encouraging. It is surprising, however, that this drug is still being developed, despite the fact that it was first shown to be active against leukemia in vitro over 30 years ago, and entered initial clinical trials 20 years ago. The reason for this very protracted development may reflect the unique nature of this drug. The dose-dependent cytotoxicity versus differentiation and demethylation has confounded the evaluation of this drug, and only recently have studies begun to capitalize on the better understanding of its mechanisms of action. Recent advances and interest in the role of DNA methylation in the pathophysiology of malignancy have contributed to a renewed interest in decitabine as a potent DNA demethylating agent. Clinical studies have been reported by a very limited number of enthusiastic research groups who have been studying this drug for 10 to 20 years. It is not clear if the failure to expand research groups and apply for drug registration was due to marketing decisions or lack of clinical enthusiasm. This situation appears to have improved since SuperGen acquired the worldwide rights in 1999 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="341375"&gt;341375&lt;/ulink&gt;], leading to the recent regulatory applications for marketing. There are however, several areas that should still be actively studied.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The optimal decitabine administration schedule is still not clear, but good efficacy with low toxicity of low-dose schedules appears most promising. Subcutaneous administration at low doses also has biological activity in sickle cell anemia. It is not clear why the subcutaneous route has not been explored further in hematological malignancies, since this would certainly help with practical aspects of administration and minimize hospital attendance. Potentially the subcutaneous route could have a favorable pharmacokinetic profile over intravenous use.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Particularly relevant advances in the pharmacology of decitabine include the enhancement of potentially immunogenic antigens on the surface of tumor cells, induction of interferon-responsive genes in the cancer cells, activation of tumor suppressor genes and synergistic anti-proliferative actions when combined with HDAC inhibitors. This opens several possibilities. Firstly, decitabine could be used as an adjunct to vaccination or immunotherapeutic strategies against malignancy. It may be particularly suitable to enhance graft versus tumor effect post allogeneic stem-cell transplant or post autologous transplant when used in combination with immunostimulants such as interferon, IL-2 and GM-CSF, or when used in conjunction with donor leucocyte infusions [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503314"&gt;503314&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Secondly, it may also be useful outside of the transplant setting in conjunction with recognized anticancer immunomodulatory drugs such as interferon or IL-2 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="502903"&gt;502903&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Thirdly, rational combinations can be designed with other drugs affecting DNA metabolism, particularly exploiting synergy with HDAC inhibitors. Most of this work is at the preclinical stage and significant clinical studies are required. Studies with interferon and GM-CSF combinations would be expected to synergize with the ability of decitabine to stimulate interferon-responsive genes and promote tumor-antigen expression. A number of studies are currently recruiting, designed to evaluate the potential of decitabine variously in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, depsipeptide and valproic acid, in a number of solid and hematological tumor indications [&lt;ulink url="www.clinicaltrials.gov"&gt;www.clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The most advanced and promising therapeutic uses of decitabine are in MDS, CML and sickle cell anemia. Phase III studies in MDS have prolonged time to progression [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="530064"&gt;530064&lt;/ulink&gt;], while phase II studies showed an ~ 50% response rate in advanced MDS independent of age, risk scores and poor prognosis cytogenetics [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503355"&gt;503355&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This is almost identical to the phase III results of the closely related demethylating agent 5-azacytidine, which was recently proven superior to best supportive care [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="505143"&gt;505143&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Some evidence suggests that decitabine has a more favorable safety profile than 5-azacytidine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519171"&gt;519171&lt;/ulink&gt;] and so decitabine might be the preferred treatment for MDS. Ideally, a comparative study between the two demethylating agents should be performed to compare toxicity and efficacy. Decitabine along with 5-azacytidine is now listed in consensus-based practice guidelines for patients with high-risk MDS who are not candidates for stem-cell transplantation or AML-like therapy and are &amp;lt; 75 years old [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519174"&gt;519174&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients with clonal chromosomal abnormalities were highly recommended to receive treatment and it was stated that no specific recommendations on the use of one drug with respect to the other can be given at this time. A low-dose schedule of &amp;lt;/= 130 mg/m2 for decitabine was recommended.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In CML, decitabine is effective in all phases of the disease and in blastic phase is equivalent to intensive chemotherapy, which makes it an attractive choice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387073"&gt;387073&lt;/ulink&gt;]. CML treatment at present is dominated by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;, but there is still a significant failure rate especially in patients with advanced phase CML [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519175"&gt;519175&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Decitabine is unlikely to have a primary role in CML treatment, but may prove useful in combination with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;, especially in advanced disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="493569"&gt;493569&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The potential role of decitabine in acute leukemia is unclear. It is certainly active, but the delayed and moderately severe neutropenia observed has possibly discouraged investigators from pursuing this indication, even though non-hematological toxicity is remarkably low. The low-dose, 10-day, MD Anderson schedule was effective in refractory/relapsed AML patients, which is impressive and should be confirmed in larger numbers of patients. This could be particularly attractive in elderly patients with AML who cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503324"&gt;503324&lt;/ulink&gt;], and a large study in elderly AML is now required. This could be achieved with a good-sized phase II study, since historical data of studies in the elderly with AML consistently gives very poor results, with long-term survival of &amp;lt; 10 to 20% [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519176"&gt;519176&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Whether or not particular subtypes of AML respond favorably to decitabine is unknown, but in vitro studies suggest demethylating agents may be particularly useful in leukemias associated with aberrant DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation, eg AML with MLL gene duplication, acute PML with PML/RAR gene re-arrangement, or AML with t(8:21) having the AML1/ETO gene rearrangement [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518918"&gt;518918&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518920"&gt;518920&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518921"&gt;518921&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The activity of decitabine in ALL, CLL, lymphoma and myeloma is also not clear. Some early studies in childhood ALL showed some activity, but there is little or no information concerning lymphomas and myeloma. Hypermethylation of p16 and p15 genes is frequent in myeloma, and may correlate with more aggressive disease. In vitro studies with myeloma showed that decitabine effectively inhibits growth of human myeloma cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518924"&gt;518924&lt;/ulink&gt;], but no clinical studies have been reported. Phase II studies are required in lymphoma, myeloma and possibly CLL. Furthermore, studies of decitabine in solid tumors have not been encouraging, but occasional long-term responses are seen in lung cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503312"&gt;503312&lt;/ulink&gt;], and the drug should not be abandoned at this stage. Short treatment durations and high-dose schedules may have failed to exploit the mechanism of action of decitabine in a slow growing tumor, and new rationally designed scheduling of chemotherapy 8 days post decitabine are promising.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Decitabine is particularly promising for the therapy of sickle cell anemia. Although only small numbers of patients have been treated, highly significant improvements in hemoglobin levels and rises in HbF have occurred and, with limited follow-up, these patients have been free of acute sickling episodes [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="453903"&gt;453903&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518862"&gt;518862&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These responses have occurred in the 25% of patients unresponsive to hydroxyurea, which has become a standard therapy. Although there is a concern about unknown long-term toxicity and mutagenic effects from decitabine, the same also applies to hydroxyurea [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519154"&gt;519154&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="519182"&gt;519182&lt;/ulink&gt;] and this is, therefore, unlikely to be a discouragement to further use of decitabine in this indication. Importantly, studies have shown benefit with subcutaneous injections at very low doses for prolonged periods of up to 12 weeks in total. Larger, long-term, controlled studies are now required to prove the clinical benefits.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In conclusion, decitabine is an important novel therapeutic compound, but has suffered from a long and protracted development. It is highly likely the drug will be a major advance in MDS; however it does have a closely related competitor (5-azacytidine) and which drug is preferred may depend on marketing expertise, unless significant differences in efficacy or toxicity are demonstrated. Decitabine is also likely to become an important therapy in sickle cell anemia, particularly for patients unresponsive to hydroxyurea, and if long-term safety is demonstrated, it could be superior to hydroxyurea. Decitabine may have a role in acute leukemia and CML, but possibly at new novel low-dose schedules and possibly in combination with other synergistic drugs. Its potential role in myeloma and lymphoma needs to be tested in clinical trials. Decitabine holds promise as an adjunct to immunotherapy for cancer, especially in combination with other immunomodulatory drugs and stem-cell transplantation, but significant clinical trials are still required. At present, decitabine probably does not have a role in solid tumors, but low-dose schedules should be investigated, and combinations with immunomodulatory drugs and immunization strategies may prove interesting.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Armugam Manoharan, Department of Clinical Haematology, St George Hospital, &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="25163"&gt;University of New South Wales&lt;/ulink&gt;, Sydney, Australia&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Publication date: 25th October 2000&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Decitabine (5-azadeoxycytidine, 5-CdR, AZA-DC, DAC) is a potent DNA methyl transferase inhibitor, with therapeutic potential in patients with acute (AML) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258480"&gt;258480&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258486"&gt;258486&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258500"&gt;258500&lt;/ulink&gt;] and chronic [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258479"&gt;258479&lt;/ulink&gt;] myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258501"&gt;258501&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258502"&gt;258502&lt;/ulink&gt;], prostatic carcinoma [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="273402"&gt;273402&lt;/ulink&gt;] and lung carcinoma [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="255690"&gt;255690&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258475"&gt;258475&lt;/ulink&gt;].

The results suggest that exposure to these drugs induces a resistant phenotype, marked by functional dck deficiency, due to mutations occurring in the dck gene. In another study, Ara C induced rearrangement and point mutation, whereas decitabine induced only point mutation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="218902"&gt;218902&lt;/ulink&gt;]. As both these cytosine nucleoside analogs are metabolized by the same enzymes, resistance to decitabine is more common in patients who have previously been exposed to Ara C [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258476"&gt;258476&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258479"&gt;258479&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Decitabine has an antineoplastic effect on leukemic and carcinoma cells, as well as a differentiation potential on AML and stem cells in patients with MDS.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In vitro studies on human leukemia cell lines, including HL60, showed cytotoxicity through induction of demethylation of DNA [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258476"&gt;258476&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258500"&gt;258500&lt;/ulink&gt;] or suppression of clonogenic blast cell growth [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258499"&gt;258499&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Some of these studies also displayed gene activation and cellular differentiation of AML blasts [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258500"&gt;258500&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258506"&gt;258506&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In vitro studies on lung carcinoma cell lines activated a tumor suppressor gene and an antineoplastic effect in colony assay [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258475"&gt;258475&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The differentiation potential of decitabine therapy has been reported in two in vivo studies in MDS patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258501"&gt;258501&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258502"&gt;258502&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;Decitabine is an S phase-specific agent with a short plasma half-life (15 to 20 min) and a dose schedule-dependent antileukemia effect; an 8-h intravenous infusion of 200 to 600 mg/m2 achieves a steady state of plasma levels in the range known to modulate gene expression in in vitro culture systems [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258476"&gt;258476&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At daily doses of 45 to 50 mg/m2, decitabine is thought to act through the differentiation mechanism to achieve clinical remissions in patients with poor prognosis MDS, with only slight and transient bone marrow hypoplasia [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258501"&gt;258501&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Since dck is responsible for the metabolic activation of decitabine, its role has been extensively studied in in vitro experiments comprising cell lines from a rat AML model of acquired resistance to Ara C and decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="218901"&gt;218901&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="218902"&gt;218902&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258495"&gt;258495&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258496"&gt;258496&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a study of Ara C-resistant cell lines (RCL/A, RA/7) and a decitabine-resistant cell line (RCL/D), Stegmann et al demonstrated a total deficiency of dck activity, accompanied by severely impaired metamobilization of deoxycytidine, and cross resistance for Ara C and decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258496"&gt;258496&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At the chromosomal level, karyotype analysis has revealed the presence of an aberrant 2q+ chromosome in RCL/A lines and a translocation (Xq:11q) in RA/7 lines; in contrast, the RCL/D lines were identical to the parental (decitabine-sensitive) RCL/O lines. Analysis at the molecular level has shown identical rearrangement of the dck gene in RCL/A and RA/7 lines that resulted in the absence of dck expression. No genomic rearrangements were observed in the decitabine-resistant cell lines. However, detection of a single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) showed a single C to G substitution (His to Gln) in the dck c-DNA of the decitabine resistant sub-clone, hence the suggestion that these drugs induce a resistant phenotype, marked by functional dCk deficiency, as a result of mutations occurring in the dck gene [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="218901"&gt;218901&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase I and pharmacokinetic study, 21 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with decitabine (25 to 100 mg/m2) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="382238"&gt;382238&lt;/ulink&gt;]. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of &amp;lt; than 1% of the administered dose were observed, suggesting that decitabine is rapidly eliminated,largely by metabolic processes. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;Decitabine, especially when used at higher doses (&gt;= 200 mg/m2/day) or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs (eg, daunorubicin), is known to cause significant myelosuppression and cytopenias, which can be prolonged and even lead to death [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258479"&gt;258479&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258480"&gt;258480&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258475"&gt;258475&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258492"&gt;258492&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258500"&gt;258500&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="382238"&gt;382238&lt;/ulink&gt;].

After a minimum of two courses, ten patients were evaluable: three achieved a complete remission, one achieved a partial remission and extra-hematological toxicity was generally mild.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase I/II study, ten patients with unfavourable MDS (two patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts, eight patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation) were treated with decitabine [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258501"&gt;258501&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Six patients received three 4-h intravenous infusions at a total daily dose of 45 mg/m2 for three days, and four patients received a daily dose of 50 mg/m2 as a continuous infusion for three days. Four patients achieved a complete hematological response (ie, normalization of blood counts and bone marrow). A slight, transient bone marrow hypoplasia was observed in less than half of the patients, while severe bone marrow asplasia was not observed.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; Decitabine has been evaluated in acute leukemia in relapse post-allogeneic progenitor cell transplantation (Group 1) or as part of a conditioning regimen for allogeneic transplantation for acute or chronic myeloid leukemia (Group 2) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258479"&gt;258479&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Group 1 patients received a dose of 1000 mg/m2 of decitabine as a single agent, whilst Group 2 patients received 400 mg/m2 of decitabine combined with busulphan (12 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg). All three Group 1 patients achieved complete remission, although only one was disease-free at 160 days post-therapy. Three of the four Group 2 patients were alive at &amp;gt; 100 days post-transplantation, of which two of these were in complete hematological and cytogenetic remission.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a pilot phase I/II study, 15 patients with stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma were treated with decitabine (200 to 660 mg/m2) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258475"&gt;258475&lt;/ulink&gt;]. For nine assessable patients receiving one or more cycles, the median survival duration was 6.7 months; three patients survived for more than 15 months. Myelosuppression, the major side effect, necessitated a 5- to 6- week recovery period before the subsequent cycle of therapy.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;Several phase II studies have been reported. Schwartsmann et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258480"&gt;258480&lt;/ulink&gt;] treated eight AML patients with decitabine (90 mg/m2 4-h daily iv infusion) for five days with daunorubicin (50 mg/m2) for 3 days; a maximum of two courses were given as first-line therapy at 4 to 6 weekly intervals. All six evaluable patients achieved complete remission. Another phase II study evaluated decitabine in combination with amsacrine or idarubicin in patients with relapsed leukemia; complete remission was achieved in some patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258486"&gt;258486&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Following a previous, small phase II study [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258487"&gt;258487&lt;/ulink&gt;], Wijermans et al published a multicenter phase II study in 66 elderly (median age 68 years) high-risk MDS patients treated with low-dose decitabine (15 mg/m2 4-h iv infusion tid) for 3 consecutive days, every 6 weeks for four to six courses in responsive patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="387071"&gt;387071&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The overall response rate was 49%, the actuarial median response duration was 31 weeks and the treatment-related mortality rate was 7%. As myelosuppression was common, a cytotoxic mode of action was considered more likely than the previously suggested differentiation effect.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Another recent report [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="387073"&gt;387073&lt;/ulink&gt;] has compared the efficacy of decitabine therapy (31 patients) with other single agents (41 patients), as well as intensive chemotherapy (90 patients) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in non-lymphoid blastic phase. The dosage of decitabine ranged from 100 to 200 mg/m2/day for 5 days for the first course, which was reduced by 50% for the second course and by 25 to 50% for the third and subsequent courses, at 4- to 5-week intervals. Compared with intensive chemotherapy, decitabine showed favorable results with similar objective response rates, a better non-hematologic toxicity profile and a trend for better survival (29 weeks versus 21 weeks), particularly among older patients.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase II study of 14 men with progressive, metastatic, hormone-independent, prostatic cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="375751"&gt;375751&lt;/ulink&gt;], three 1-h iv infusions of decitabine (75 mg/m2/dose) were administered every 8 h; cycles were repeated every 5 to 8 weeks. Two of the 12 evaluable patients had stable disease with a time to progression of more than 10 weeks.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;No data are currently available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Decitabine is a welcome addition to the list of effective antineoplastic drugs, with metabolic and pharmacological properties similar to those of Ara C. It has therapeutic potential in a variety of hematological and non-hematological malignancies, but more clinical studies are needed to ascertain the ideal dose schedule and its place in combination chemotherapy protocols. Studies are also required to compare the efficacy of decitabine and Ara C when used as first-line treatment for patients with AML and poor prognosis MDS. For these patients, the hope that remission can be achieved through differentiation without myelotoxicity has, unfortunately, receded - a result similar to that seen with low-dose Ara C therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="387075"&gt;387075&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The major limiting factor for the use of decitabine is the likelihood of its ineffectiveness, due to drug resistance, in patients who have received prior treatment with Ara C.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="17332">Johnson &amp;
