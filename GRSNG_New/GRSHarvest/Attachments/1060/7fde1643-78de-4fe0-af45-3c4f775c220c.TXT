linkID="23137" linkType="Company"&gt;Novartis&lt;/ulink&gt; has developed and launched imatinib (Glivec; Gleevec; Ruvise),  an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases including Bcr-Abl and c-kit. The product is indicated in the EU in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment  of newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as the first line of treatment; for Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or in accelerated phase or blast crisis; for newly diagnosed Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) integrated with chemotherapy. For adults, imatinib is also indicated for relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy; for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene rearrangements; for advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFR-alpha rearrangement;  for the treatment of Kit-positive unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST); for the adjuvant treatment of patients at significant risk of relapse following resection of Kit-positive GIST; for unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP); and for recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP patients who are not eligible for surgery [&lt;ulink linkID="1885749" linkType="Reference"&gt;1885749&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the US, imatinib is indicated for the oral treatment of newly diagnosed adult and pediatric Ph+ CML patients; patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis, accelerated phase or chronic phase after interferon therapy; for adults with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL; for pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy; for adults with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR gene rearrangements as determined with an FDA-approved test; for adults with aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) without the D816V c-Kit mutation as determined with an FDA-approved test or with c-Kit mutational status unknown;  for adults with HES and/or CEL who have the FIP1L1-PDGFR-alpha fusion kinase and for patients with HES and/or CEL who are FIP1L1-PDGFR-alpha kinase fusion kinase negative or unknown; for adults with unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP; patients with  Kit-positive GIST; and for adjuvant treatment of adults following resection of Kit-positive GIST [&lt;ulink linkID="485325" linkType="Reference"&gt;485325&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In Japan, the product is indicated for CML, KIT-positive GIST, Ph+ ALL and eosinophilic syndrome [&lt;ulink linkID="1897777" linkType="Reference"&gt;1897777&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Imatinib was first launched for CML in the US in May 2001 for interferon-intolerant and -resistant patients [&lt;ulink linkID="408643" linkType="Reference"&gt;408643&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="408969" linkType="Reference"&gt;408969&lt;/ulink&gt;]; it was approved for CML in this setting in Europe in November 2001 [&lt;ulink linkID="430396" linkType="Reference"&gt;430396&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1352116" linkType="Reference"&gt;1352116&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1359117" linkType="Reference"&gt;1359117&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The CML indication was expanded, in the US in December 2002 and in the EU in January 2003, to include newly diagnosed adult and pediatric patients with CML [&lt;ulink linkID="477293" linkType="Reference"&gt;477293&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The drug was approved in Japan for CML in November 2001 [&lt;ulink linkID="432779" linkType="Reference"&gt;432779&lt;/ulink&gt;] and by December 2001, the drug had been launched in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="433321" linkType="Reference"&gt;433321&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2002, the FDA approved imatinib for inoperable and/or metastatic malignant  GIST and the product was launched for this indication within the  month [&lt;ulink linkID="438618" linkType="Reference"&gt;438618&lt;/ulink&gt;]; approval was granted in Europe in May 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="1258185" linkType="Reference"&gt;1258185&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2003, approval was granted in Japan for inoperable GIST [&lt;ulink linkID="509952" linkType="Reference"&gt;509952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2008, the FDA approved imatinib for adjuvant treatment in patients who have undergone complete removal of Kit-positive GIST  [&lt;ulink linkID="972218" linkType="Reference"&gt;972218&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="972455" linkType="Reference"&gt;972455&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1259104" linkType="Reference"&gt;1259104&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2009, the EC granted approval for adjuvant treatment of GIST [&lt;ulink linkID="1007043" linkType="Reference"&gt;1007043&lt;/ulink&gt;]; at that time,  the drug was launched in the UK [&lt;ulink linkID="1355858" linkType="Reference"&gt;1355858&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2012, the FDA granted approval for extended imatinib use for 36 months after surgery for  Kit (CD117)-positive GIST [&lt;ulink linkID="1259127" linkType="Reference"&gt;1259127&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1259104" linkType="Reference"&gt;1259104&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in February 2012, the EC approved the same label extension  [&lt;ulink linkID="1266816" linkType="Reference"&gt;1266816&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2006, imatinib was approved in the EU for use in adults with newly diagnosed Ph+ALL in combination with chemotherapy and as a single agent for patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ALL [&lt;ulink linkID="692272" linkType="Reference"&gt;692272&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Approval for relapsed/refractory ALL was granted in the US in October 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="849250" linkType="Reference"&gt;849250&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By January 2011, approval had been granted in Japan for Ph+ ALL [&lt;ulink linkID="1164651" linkType="Reference"&gt;1164651&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2013, approval was granted in the US for use of imatinib in children with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL [&lt;ulink linkID="1363439" linkType="Reference"&gt;1363439&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2013, the EMA approved the drug for pediatric Ph+ ALL [&lt;ulink linkID="1490461" linkType="Reference"&gt;1490461&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2006, Novartis submitted a European application for the treatment of  ASM in adults. However in October 2006, Novartis withdrew the European ASM application as the Agency's CHMP indicated that the data were too limited  to conclude  a positive benefit-risk balance. At that time, US approval had been granted for ASM, as well as DFSP, MDS/MPD, HES/CEL  [&lt;ulink linkID="734009" linkType="Reference"&gt;734009&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="849250" linkType="Reference"&gt;849250&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2006, the EMA had approved the use of the drug in patients with DFSP, HES, and MDS/MPD diseases and it is presumed that launch in these settings occurred immediately after approval in the EU [&lt;ulink linkID="785234" linkType="Reference"&gt;785234&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2012, imatinib was approved in Japan for the treatment of FIP1L1-PDGFRalfa-positive HES and CEL [&lt;ulink linkID="1265519" linkType="Reference"&gt;1265519&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Imatinib is also being developed for other   indications.  In  May 2016, imatinib was being developed for the treatment of severe asthma [&lt;ulink linkID="1767521" linkType="Reference"&gt;1767521&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in May 2017, positive data were published [&lt;ulink linkID="1945321" linkType="Reference"&gt;1945321&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Previous development has also been undertaken. By January 2006, phase III trials in refractory glioblastoma multiforme were ongoing; however, development for this indication had been discontinued by January 2008 as no improvement in PFS was demonstrated [&lt;ulink linkID="878594" linkType="Reference"&gt;878594&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Prior to January 2003,  trials had been initiated in polycythemia vera and small-cell lung cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="477293" linkType="Reference"&gt;477293&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, by September 2005, development in these indications was no longer being pursued [&lt;ulink linkID="624175" linkType="Reference"&gt;624175&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By October 2008, phase II/III trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had been discontinued after no treatment  benefit had been observed [&lt;ulink linkID="949700" linkType="Reference"&gt;949700&lt;/ulink&gt;].

By May 2014, Novartis had filed a lawsuit against Sun; at that time, the patent litigation between Novartis and a subsidiary of Sun was settled, upholding the validity of the US patents covering polymorphic forms of imatinib. As a result of the settlement, the subsidiary of Sun was permitted to launch a generic version of imatinib in the US on February 01, 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1557371" linkType="Reference"&gt;1557371&lt;/ulink&gt;].

At that time, Novartis was in the process of enforcing all these challenged patents [&lt;ulink linkID="2004756" linkType="Reference"&gt;2004756&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in  January 2019, this was still the case for the oral formulation patent and the GIST method of use patent [&lt;ulink linkID="2116311" linkType="Reference"&gt;2116311&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By January 2018, Novartis had resolved patent litigation with certain generic manufacturers in the EU [&lt;ulink linkID="2004756" linkType="Reference"&gt;2004756&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2015, litigations in the UK and Portugal were ongoing  [&lt;ulink linkID="1636427" linkType="Reference"&gt;1636427&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2013, &lt;ulink linkID="1052220" linkType="Company"&gt;Accord Healthcare&lt;/ulink&gt; received EU approval for its generic imatinib film-coated tablets (100 mg) [&lt;ulink linkID="1454300" linkType="Reference"&gt;1454300&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In December 2011, further data from this French SPIRIT trial were presented at the 53rd ASH meeting in San Diego, CA. Of 789 patients, 223 received imatinib (400 mg), and 221 received imatinib + peg IFN; of these 221 patients, 171 and 50 patients received 90 and 45 microg doses of peg IFN, respectively, along with imatinib. The rate adverse events was reduced in patients treated with 45-microg peg IFN in combination with imatinib, when compared with that in 90 microg peg IFN group. By 12 months, the major and superior molecular response was 60 and 28% in 45 microg peg IFN group, respectively, when compared with 54 and 25%, respectively, in 90 microg peg IFN group. At 60 months, the rate of progression-free survival was 94 and 92% in imatinib + peg IFN group and imatinib alone group, respectively.

Philadelphia-positive CML patients (n = 177) received treatment with imatinib. At the end of the follow-up period, most of the patients (88%) were alive. For 33% of patients, dose modifications were done, and 29 patients had interruption after initiation of imatinib treatment. Of 177 patients, 41 switched to &lt;ulink linkID="48946" linkType="Drug"&gt;dasatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; or &lt;ulink linkID="51388" linkType="Drug"&gt;nilotinib&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="1347954" linkType="Reference"&gt;1347954&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference, later that month. By the end of 18 months, the cumulative compete cytogenetic response rate was increased to 47% from 28% at 6 months.

All  patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase in two sequential cohorts (n = 105 in each cohort) received treatment starting with imatinib (600 mg); those patients with imatinib levels &amp;lt; 1000 ng/ml on day 22 were dose escalated to 800 mg. In cohort 1, patients failing to achieve the targets were dose escalated to 800 mg and on further failure were switched to nilotinib; in cohort 2, such patients were directly switched to without escalating to 800 mg imatinib. Of 174 evaluable patients, 64, 26, and 10% of patients had BCR-ABL &amp;lt; 1, 1 to &amp;lt; 10, and &amp;gt;/=10%, respectively at 3 months, and the major molecular response rate was  87, 38, and 27%, respectively, at 12 months (primary endpoint) [&lt;ulink linkID="1244880" linkType="Reference"&gt;1244880&lt;/ulink&gt;].

The first 77 patients were started at 400 mg, with the remaining 158 patients starting at 600 mg. Overall, 21% of patients had a major cytogenic response, with 13% showing no evidence of leukemia and 20% showing a return to chronic phase. Response rates in accelerated phase CML were higher for the 600 mg dose group than for the 400 mg group: hematologic response (75% vs 64%), confirmed and unconfirmed major cytogenetic response (31% vs 19%) [&lt;ulink linkID="485325" linkType="Reference"&gt;485325&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;CML: myeloid blast crisis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In a phase II trial, 260 patients with myeloid blast crisis were enrolled. The first 37 patients were started at 400 mg; the remaining 223 patients were started at 600 mg. The hematologic response rate was higher in previously untreated patients than in previously treated patients (36% vs 22%, respectively) and in the group receiving an initial dose of 600 mg rather than 400 mg (33% vs 16%). The confirmed and unconfirmed major cytogenetic response rate was also higher for the 600 mg dose group than for the 400 mg dose group (17% vs 8%). Overall, 7% of patients had a major cytogenic response, with 5% showing no evidence of leukemia and 18% showing a return to chronic phase [&lt;ulink linkID="485325" linkType="Reference"&gt;485325&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Newly diagnosed CML&lt;/subtitle&gt;By December 2000, a phase III study involving newly diagnosed CML patients was being conducted in North America, Europe and Australia [&lt;ulink linkID="392492" linkType="Reference"&gt;392492&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This study compared single-agent imatinib or a combination of interferon-alpha (IFN) plus cytarabine (Ara-C). Patients were allowed to cross over to the alternative treatment arm if they failed to show a complete hematologic response (CHR) at 6 months, a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) at 12 months, or if they lost a CHR or MCyR.  In the imatinib arm, patients were treated initially with 400 mg daily. Dose escalations were allowed from 400 mg daily to 600 mg daily, then from 600 mg daily to 800 mg daily. In the IFN arm, patients were treated with a target dose of IFN of 5 MIU/m2/day subcutaneously in combination with subcutaneous Ara-C 20 mg/m2/day for 10 days/month. A total of 1106 patients were randomized, 553 to each arm. At the cut-off for this analysis (7 years after last patient had been recruited), the median duration of first-line treatment was 82 and 8 months in the imatinib and IFN arm, respectively. The median duration of second-line treatment with imatinib was 64 months, and 60% of patients randomized to imatinib were still receiving first-line treatment. Due to discontinuations and crossovers, only 2% of patients randomized to IFN were still on first-line treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS).  The estimated rate of progression-free survival at 84 months in the ITT population was 81.2% in the imatinib arm and 60.6% in the IFN arm. With 7 years follow up there were 93 (16.8%) progression events in the imatinib arm; there were 165 (29.8%) events in the IFN+Ara-C arm of which 130 occurred during first-line treatment with IFN-Ara-C. The estimated rate of patients free of progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis at 84 months was 92.5 % in the imatinib arm compared to 85.1%, in the IFN arm. At 84 months the estimated overall survival was 86.4% vs 83.3% in the  imatinib and the IFN+Ara-C group, respectively. Complete hematologic response, major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response were also significantly higher in the Gleevec arm compared to the IFN + Ara-C arm [&lt;ulink linkID="485325" linkType="Reference"&gt;485325&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2007, a phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial (&lt;ulink linkID="43925" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00471497&lt;/ulink&gt;; CAMN107A2303; 2007-000208-34; ENESTnd) began in the US, Europe, South America, Asia and Africa in newly diagnosed CML patients (n = 846). The trial compared &lt;ulink linkID="51388" linkType="Drug"&gt;nilotinib&lt;/ulink&gt; (300 or 400 mg bid) with imatinib (400 mg qd) and the primary endpoint was the rate of MMR after 12 months of treatment assessed by the degree of elimination of the cells that carry the Bcr-Abl protein in the bone marrow.

The study assessed the beneficial effects of imatinib in rats with pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) and the mechanism involved. Results showed that imatinib protected right ventricular systolic pressure, decreased ventricular hypertrophy and inhibited development of PAH.

In Bcr-Abl positive cells, imatinib induced early G1 arrest, followed by apoptosis within 48 h [&lt;ulink linkID="393478" linkType="Reference"&gt;393478&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Survival was prolonged in CML mice receiving imatinib [&lt;ulink linkID="393654" linkType="Reference"&gt;393654&lt;/ulink&gt;], and synergy with AG-490 (qv) was also demonstrated. Various other roles and properties of imatinib were demonstrated or elucidated, including apoptosis [&lt;ulink linkID="393478" linkType="Reference"&gt;393478&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="393662" linkType="Reference"&gt;393662&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="393667" linkType="Reference"&gt;393667&lt;/ulink&gt;] and ARG tyrosine kinase inhibition [&lt;ulink linkID="393658" linkType="Reference"&gt;393658&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2000, data presented at the 91st AACR meeting in San Francisco, CA, showed that imatinib inhibited the growth of four of five small-cell lung cancer cell lines, with an IC50 value of about 5 microM. The drug also inhibited stem-cell-factor (SCF)-mediated Kit activation in H526 small-cell lung cancer cells pretreated with imatinib (IC50 = 0.1 to 0.5 microM) [&lt;ulink linkID="360351" linkType="Reference"&gt;360351&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="364268" linkType="Reference"&gt;364268&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Separately, studies into the selectivity of imatinib against other protein tyrosine kinases showed that the compound is a potent inhibitor of alpha- and beta-type PDGF receptor and c-kit. It also has the potential to inhibit PDGF- and SCF-mediated cellular events, showing in vivo antitumor activity against PDGF-driven tumor cells. This indicates that imatinib may be useful in the treatment of diseases involving deregulated PDGF receptor and c-kit [&lt;ulink linkID="362673" linkType="Reference"&gt;362673&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Imatinib selectively inhibits c-kit tyrosine kinase activity and activation of target proteins in cellular proliferation. It was equally effective against wild-type and activated c-kit kinase activity [&lt;ulink linkID="350196" linkType="Reference"&gt;350196&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Close correlation between in vitro responses to IFN-alpha and imatinib suggested that imatinib may be an alternative to IFN-alpha therapy for chronic-phase CML, and the compound has the advantage that it can be administered orally [&lt;ulink linkID="350466" linkType="Reference"&gt;350466&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In preclinical studies, nude mice were administered placebo, or imatinib as a 50 mg/kg ip dose or 160 mg/kg po dose, every 8 h for 11 days. A total of 87.5% of control animals developed leukemia within 10 days compared with 87.5% of ip-treated and 100% of po-treated animals, which remained free of cancer for more than 90 days [&lt;ulink linkID="284932" linkType="Reference"&gt;284932&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Bcr-Abl-expressing cells treated with imatinib underwent apoptosis. In colony-forming assays of peripheral blood or bone marrow from patients with CML, the number of Bcr-Abl colonies formed in the presence of imatinib decreased by 92 to 98%. Imatinib did not inhibit colony formation by hematopoietic cells from non-CML patients or Bcr-Abl-negative CML patients [&lt;ulink linkID="193507" linkType="Reference"&gt;193507&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrates that imatinib has a plasma half-life of 11 to 14 h, suggesting that once-daily oral therapy is appropriate [&lt;ulink linkID="308845" linkType="Reference"&gt;308845&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Initially, a series of phenylamino-pyrimidine (PAP) derivatives were identified. The most potent in this series had an IC50 value of 38 nM and selectivity for the Abl tyrosine kinase in vitro [&lt;ulink linkID="260612" linkType="Reference"&gt;260612&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Antiproliferative activity of one analog against v-Abl- or v-sis-transformed cell lines but not against EGF-dependent MK or FDC-P1 cells and a 60 to 80% decrease in the number of Bcr-Abl colonies in a colony-forming assay of peripheral blood or bone marrow from patients with CML was reported [&lt;ulink linkID="310136" linkType="Reference"&gt;310136&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In combination with other antineoplastic agents, imatinib restored the chemotherapeutic sensitivities of Bcr-Abl (MO7p210) cells to the parental cell line for all agents except hydroxyurea, and reversed drug resistance induced by BCR-Abl expression [&lt;ulink linkID="350272" linkType="Reference"&gt;350272&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Compared to arsenic trioxide, imatinib treatment for 48 h or more resulted in significant inhibition of Bcl-XL levels without affecting BCR-Abl levels in blast crisis K562 AML cells. Cotreatment sensitized HL-60/BCR-Abl and K562 cells to Ara-C, doxorubicin and etoposide-induced apoptosis and induced apoptosis in approximately 85% of HL-60, BCR-Abl and K562 cells [&lt;ulink linkID="350589" linkType="Reference"&gt;350589&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Imatinib, an analog of &lt;ulink linkID="8867" linkType="Drug"&gt;CGP-53716&lt;/ulink&gt;, inhibited v-Abl tyrosine kinase with an IC50 value of 0.1 to 0.3 microM, with similar potency to the PDGF receptor, in intact cells. In an in vivo xenograft model, doses of 3.13 to 50 mg/kg/day ip inhibited the growth of MuLV- and v-sis-transformed BALC/c3T3 cells, with the higher dose almost resulting in tumor stasis after 28 to 31 days of treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="286424" linkType="Reference"&gt;286424&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In addition to v-Abl tyrosine kinase (IC50 = 33 nM), imatinib is also an inhibitor of PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase with an IC50 value of 300 nM, and showed a high selectivity against a panel of &amp;gt; 20 serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. In cells, v-Abl and PDGF receptor autophosphorylation as well as PDGF-induced c-fos mRNA expression were blocked with similar IC50 values. In vivo, imatinib inhibited tumor growth in nude mice inoculated with tumorigenic BCR-Abl-expressing cells [&lt;ulink linkID="310136" linkType="Reference"&gt;310136&lt;/ulink&gt;].

For example, overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (a protein tyrosine kinase) has been reported to occur in: (i) 90 to 100% of head and neck tumors; (ii) 40 to 60% of gliomas; (iii) 45 to 84% of lung cancers; and, (iv) 60 to 89% of prostate tumors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419453"&gt;419453&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Such data prompted the idea that small-molecule inhibitors of protein kinases could be useful therapeutic agents for cancer treatment. The catalytic site of protein kinases contains neighboring domains for binding the substrate and the ATP &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="27576"&gt;cofactor&lt;/ulink&gt;. Early attempts to develop inhibitors focused on compounds that would competitively bind to the substrate site; however, most such compounds had low potency and moderate selectivity. Subsequent studies of compounds directed at the ATP-binding site showed that such drugs had good selectivity not only between tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases but also between different tyrosine kinases. These results were somewhat surprising given the high degree of homology between the ATP-binding sites of different kinases.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem-cell disorder. In the chronic phase of the disease there are excess myeloid cells that differentiate and function normally. The disease, however, ultimately progresses to a phase called blast crisis, in which there is a progressive loss of terminal cellular differentiation that culminates in an acute leukemia that is invariably fatal. The cytogenetic hallmark of CML is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), formed by a reciprocal translocation that results in the joining of the BCR sequence upstream of the second exon of the ABL protein tyrosine kinase to produce a BCR-ABL fusion gene. The product of BCR-ABL is a deregulated protein tyrosine kinase. As well as occurring in around 95% of patients with CML, the BCR-ABL fusion gene is also found in 10 to 20% of adult de novo acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases and in rare cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The molecular consequences of BCR-ABL expression are incompletely determined, although in vitro studies with cell lines suggest that BCR-ABL expression can lead to both growth-factor-independent growth and protection against apoptosis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419471"&gt;419471&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The central role of the BCR-ABL protein kinase in driving malignant transformation and excessive cell proliferation in CML, along with the poor response of this disease to conventional therapy (median survival +/- six years), made BCR-ABL an attractive target for the development of a specific inhibitor. Early studies identified compounds, such as some of the tyrphostins [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="227056"&gt;227056&lt;/ulink&gt;], with an ability to inhibit BCR-ABL activity. These inhibitors lacked potency and/or specificity, however, making them unattractive for clinical use. An important breakthrough came with the demonstration that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; is a potent and reasonably specific inhibitor of BCR-ABL [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="257799"&gt;257799&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;Imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;, a 2-phenylamino-pyrimidine derivative, is synthesized by converting an acetyl-substituted heterocycle (or aryl-derivative) to an enaminone using N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal. Reaction of the enaminone with substituted phenylguanidine, followed by acylation with acid chloride gave &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="260612"&gt;260612&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The basis for the relative selectivity of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; action was sought by determining the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of Abl complexed to the drug [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405910"&gt;405910&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It was found that although the drug binds to the highly conserved ATP-binding site, it has high specificity for Abl because it also interacts with a distinctive inactive conformation of the activation loop of Abl. Lack of activity against the closely-related Src-family of kinases appears to result from a difference in the conformation of the activation loop in these enzymes.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Studies measuring the ability of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; to inhibit both in vitro substrate phosphorylation by purified protein kinases and cellular autophosphorylation of protein kinases have confirmed the potency and relative specificity of the drug. The IC50 value for inhibition of in vitro substrate phosphorylation was 0.025 mM for both Bcr-Abl and c-Abl, and 0.038 microM for v-Abl (oncogenic form of c-Abl from Abelson murine leukemia virus). Cellular autophosphorylation of Bcr-Abl was inhibited with IC50 = 0.25 microM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="257799"&gt;257799&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="257805"&gt;257805&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Other protein tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (IC50 &amp;gt; 100 microM) and several Src-family kinases (c-Src, c-Lyn, c-Fgr and c-Lck) showed no or only weak inhibition. Likewise, the drug had no effect on various serine/threonine kinases (eg, casein kinase 1 and 2, and protein kinase C isotypes). In addition to inhibitory activity against ABL-derived proteins, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; also shows potent inhibitory activity against three other protein tyrosine kinases: (i) Arg, which is closely related to c-Abl; (ii) c-Kit; and, (iii) platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) alpha and beta. Autophosphorylation of a TEL-ARG fusion protein, expressed in the mouse pro-B cell line BaF/3 was inhibited by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; with an IC50 of approximately 0.5 microM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419749"&gt;419749&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Stem-cell-factor-activated autophosphorylation of c-Kit in the human megakaryocytic leukemia cell line, M07e, was inhibited by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; with an IC50 of approximately 0.1 microM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405918"&gt;405918&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A similar result for c-Kit inhibition was obtained by Buchdunger et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405930"&gt;405930&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A constitutively active mutant form of c-Kit showed greater sensitivity to inhibition by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; than the wild-type protein [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405918"&gt;405918&lt;/ulink&gt;]. PDGFRalpha and beta, expressed on Swiss 3T3 cells, were inhibited by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; with an IC50 for both receptors of 0.1 microM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405930"&gt;405930&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Despite the fact that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; shows similar inhibitory activity against Bcr-Abl, v-Abl and their normal cellular counterpart, c-ABL, the drug exhibited preferential growth-inhibitory or cytotoxic activity towards cells expressing BCR-ABL or v-ABL. This effect was demonstrated by comparing the drug responses in growth-factor-dependent hematopoietic cell lines with those of cells converted to growth-factor independence by BCR-ABL or v-ABL expression. Growth of the murine myeloid cell line 32D cl3 and M07e cells was not affected by the presence of 1 or 10 microM &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;. Their Bcr-Abl-expressing derivatives, however, showed a decline in cell number in the presence of 1 microM &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;. Addition of interleukin-3 (IL-3) to 32D cl3 cells expressing Bcr-Abl blocked the decline in cell numbers but did not allow proliferation. In contrast, the growth of a 32D cl3 derivative, rendered growth-factor independent by expression of v-Src, was unaffected by the presence of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="257805"&gt;257805&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Likewise, studies comparing the survival (as quantified by MTT assay) of Ph-positive and -negative ALL cell lines, exposed to different concentrations of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; (&amp;lt;/= 10 microM) for 3 days, revealed that the drug had little effect on the proliferation of a Ph-negative line, but had a strong antiproliferative effect on three Ph-positive ALL cell lines. The antiproliferative effect reflected induction of apoptosis rather than growth inhibition [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="348314"&gt;348314&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Abnormal activation of the other protein tyrosine kinases known to be inhibited by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; (ARG, c-Kit, and PDGFRalpha and beta) has been implicated in the progression of different tumor types and in other disease states. ARG kinase is expressed at higher levels in primary colon carcinoma and metastatic tumor than in adjacent normal mucosa or adenomatous polyp and may play a critical role in the transition from adenoma to carcinoma during colon carcinogenesis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419710"&gt;419710&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition, ARG fusion genes have been found in some leukemias [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419709"&gt;419709&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Activation of c-Kit, usually by activating mutation or by autocrine or paracrine stimulation, is thought to play a role in the progression of various human tumors, including germ cell tumors, mast cell tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs), melanoma, breast cancer and neuroblastoma [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419730"&gt;419730&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Paracrine or autocrine PDGF/PDGFR loops appear to be involved in the growth of gliomas, sarcomas and some epithelial tumors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419724"&gt;419724&lt;/ulink&gt;]. PDGF has also been implicated in non-malignant proliferative disorders, including atherosclerosis, restenosis following vascular angioplasty and fibroproliferative disorders. Such data has prompted investigation of the potential use of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; to treat diseases involving abnormal activation of kinases other than Abl.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;Imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment induced apoptosis in BaF/3 cells expressing a TEL-ARG fusion gene while having no effect on the growth of the parental cell line [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419749"&gt;419749&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Apoptosis was also induced by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment of: (i) stem-cell-factor-activated M07e cells; or, (ii) the human mast cell leukemic line HMC-1, which contains the constitutively active mutant c-KIT [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405918"&gt;405918&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Krystal et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405890"&gt;405890&lt;/ulink&gt;] examined the effect of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; on the in vitro growth of six human SCLC lines that expressed different levels of c-Kit. Five of the cell lines showed growth inhibition in the presence of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; with an average IC50 of approximately 5 microM when grown in medium containing 10% serum. However, one of the cell lines that does not express c-Kit showed an intermediate sensitivity. This suggests that, at the concentrations used, the drug affects other targets in the cell. Despite the decreased growth rate in the presence of drug, no evidence of apoptosis was found, suggesting that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; had a cytostatic action. Wang et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405988"&gt;405988&lt;/ulink&gt;] also examined the effect of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; exposure on human SCLC lines and reported that three out of five lines showed decreased viability (measured using trypan-blue staining 48 h after commencement of drug exposure) with an IC50 of 1 microM. Kilic et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405885"&gt;405885&lt;/ulink&gt;] demonstrated that BALB/c-3T3 cells transformed with PDGF A or B, as well as the PDGF-expressing human glioblastoma cell lines U87 and U343 were growth inhibited by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; in PDGF-free medium. The drug had no effect, however, on cells transformed with the downstream signal activators v-src or H-ras. Growth inhibition by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; in the latter system was due to growth arrest in G0 to G1 rather than induction of apoptosis. The effect of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; on growth stimulated by a PDGF B autocrine loop has also been studied using NIH3T3 cells transfected with a chimeric PDGF B gene derived from the fibrohistiocytic tumor, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419720"&gt;419720&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Cultures treated with 1 or 5 microM &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; showed significant (&gt; 60%) dose-dependent growth inhibition.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In vitro studies demonstrating the selective growth inhibitory or cytotoxic action of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; towards cells expressing activated forms of ABL or other target kinases have been verified using ex vivo or in vivo systems. In a mouse model, the drug induced significant dose-dependent antitumor activity against tumors derived from v-abl- and v-sis (viral homolog of PDGF)-transformed BALB/c-3T3 cells, whereas it had no effect against tumors derived from v-src-transformed cells [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="257799"&gt;257799&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similarly, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment inhibited the growth of U87, U343 and 3T3 cells transformed with v-sis (but not ras), as both sc and intracranial tumors in nude mice [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405885"&gt;405885&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;Imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; also inhibited the malignant growth of NIH3T3 cells transformed with a chimeric PDGF B gene [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419720"&gt;419720&lt;/ulink&gt;]. As well as having a direct effect on tumor cell proliferation, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; may also, via its ability to inhibit PDGFR, facilitate uptake of other chemotherapeutic agents from capillaries by decreasing tumor interstitial fluid pressure [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419821"&gt;419821&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It is notable that, in the above studies, mice carrying tumors lived longer but were not cured by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment, presumably reflecting the lack of cytotoxicity towards non-hematopoietic cells that was usually (but not always) identified in in vitro studies. In contrast, there is ex vivo data showing induction of cell killing by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment of Bcr-Abl-expressing leukemic cells [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="257805"&gt;257805&lt;/ulink&gt;], which demonstrated that incubation with 1 microM &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; had no effect on the numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colonies produced by samples of normal human marrow. However, the drug markedly inhibited colony formation by cells from the peripheral blood or bone marrow of CML patients. Nakajima et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419745"&gt;419745&lt;/ulink&gt;] compared the induction of apoptosis (measured by flow cytometry with APO2.7 antibody) in primary blast cell cultures from patients with acute leukemia following in vitro incubation for 48 h with 1 or 10 mM &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;. Four cases of Ph-positive ALL showed a marked induction of apoptosis as compared with untreated controls, while two cases of Ph-negative ALL showed no response to the drug. From four cases of blastic-crisis CML, two showed no response and two showed a significant apoptotic response.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The mechanism by which &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; exposure induces apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-expressing leukemic cells is unclear, although recent studies have provided some insight. Expression of Bcr-Abl in BaF/3 cells activates cell cycling by downregulation of p27Kip1 (an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases) and upregulation of cyclin D proteins, which are known to activate E2F transcription factors and trigger entry into S-phase. Conversely, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment downregulated expression of cyclin D proteins and induced expression of p27Kip1 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405882"&gt;405882&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419751"&gt;419751&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Overexpression of p27Kip1 triggered apoptosis in BaF/3 cells [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419751"&gt;419751&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Most patients with Ph-positive acute leukemias relapse or display a lack of response to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment. This is clearly a limitation to the exploitation of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;. The basis of such resistance has been sought by in vitro selection of Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines that survive exposure to relatively high levels of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;. Using this approach, Bcl-Abl amplification was identified as a cause of increased resistance [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419741"&gt;419741&lt;/ulink&gt;], whilst other studies suggested that multiple mechanisms could be operational, including gene amplification and P-glycoprotein overexpression [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405888"&gt;405888&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405917"&gt;405917&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Several studies have examined the utility of combining &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; with other chemotherapeutic agents to overcome drug resistance. Thiesing et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="405905"&gt;405905&lt;/ulink&gt;] measured the effect (by MTT assay) of a continuous 3-day drug exposure on cell proliferation in M07e, M07/p210 (a BCR-ABL-expressing derivative of M07e) and the human CML Ph-positive cell line K562. For K562 cells, the combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; plus IFNalpha or daunorubicin gave an additive increase in proliferation inhibition, while &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; plus cytosine arabinoside gave a superadditive effect. Combination with hydroxyurea did not produce an additive effect. Similar results to those for K562 were obtained for M07/p210 cells, whereas addition of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; had no effect on the sensitivity of the parental M07e line to the above drugs. The authors also used clonogenic survival to monitor the effect of drug combinations on the survival of leukemic cells from CML patients. Consistent with the cell-line studies, greater killing was seen when &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; was combined with IFNalpha, daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside and (in contrast with cell-line studies) hydroxyurea. Kano et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419736"&gt;419736&lt;/ulink&gt;] performed similar experiments, measuring growth inhibition by MTT assay after 5 days of drug incubation in Ph-positive cell lines. Combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; with IFNalpha produced synergistic or borderline synergistic responses for the three cell lines tested. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;Imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; produced additive effects in combination with hydroxyurea, cytosine arabinoside or vincristine, but antagonized the action of methotrexate. The results from both studies clearly suggest that combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; with other agents could be advantageous for treatment of patients with acute leukemia.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;Imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; is metabolized primarily by the CYP3A4 enzyme system and drugs capable of modulating this system would be expected to alter the effectiveness of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;. A phase I trial in adults with chronic phase CML showed that the half-life of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; in the circulation ranged from 13 to 16 h. The mean plasma trough concentration was 1.46 microM at steady state, 24 h after the administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; (400 mg po) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419715"&gt;419715&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A drug concentration of 1.46 microM would be expected to kill BCR-ABL-positive cells based on in vitro results (see above).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Gambacorti-Passerini et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="393785"&gt;393785&lt;/ulink&gt;] discovered that co-administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; and erythromycin to mice bearing large tumors derived from the BCR-ABL-expressing human leukemic cell line, KU812, dramatically improved tumor cure rates as compared with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment alone. Of direct relevance to leukemia treatment, the level of alpha1 acid glycoprotein (AGP; a plasma protein that is produced by the liver in response to various stresses including host tumors) present, both in in vitro and in vivo systems, can have a marked influence on the cytotoxic action of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;. At least 90% of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; is AGP-bound in human plasma; however, erythromycin competes for binding. Hence, measurement of individual AGP levels may be important in determining optimal &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; dosage. This result suggests that AGP modulators should also be considered for inclusion in future clinical trials.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;There is no long-term clinical data available on toxicity; however, studies in animals have indicated potential problems with hepatoxicity, renal toxicity and immunosupresion [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="441334"&gt;441334&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Repeated dose studies in rats, dogs and cynomolgus monkeys showed liver toxicity (which was most severe in dogs) as manifested by hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct necrosis and bile duct hyperplasia. A 39-week study in monkeys resulted in an increase in the incidence of malarial infections that are normally suppressed in these animals. Renal toxicity was noted in monkeys treated for 2 weeks, with focal mineralization and dilation of renal tubules and tubular nephrosis. An increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine was also observed in some of these animals. Lymphopenia was observed in animals (as in humans). It is recommended that patients with hepatic ailments should be closely monitored while receiving treatment with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;The phase I trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; in chronic-phase CML included 83 Ph-positive patients aged 18 years or older who had failed IFNalpha treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419715"&gt;419715&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients were assigned to one of 14 dose cohorts ranging from 25 to 1000 mg/day. The drug was administered po daily except for the 800- and 1000-mg doses, which were administered twice daily at doses of 400 and 500 mg, respectively. Half of the patients receiving daily &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; (25, 50 or 85 mg) were removed from the study after 2 months because of elevated white cell or platelet counts. Only two patients receiving 300 mg or more discontinued therapy prematurely, one for a persistent and progressive rash and the other for recurrence of angina. A hematological response (50% reduction in white cell count maintained for at least 2 weeks) occurred in all patients treated with doses of &gt;/= 140 mg/day. A complete hematological response (white cell count reduced to &amp;lt; 10,000/ml and platelet count to &amp;lt; 450,000/ml maintained for at least 4 weeks) was achieved in 53 out of 54 patients. For all except one patient given &gt;/= 300 mg/day, a complete response (CR) was evident within 4 weeks of the commencement of treatment. Complete hematological responses were maintained in 51 out of 53 patients with a median follow-up time of 265 days. One patient relapsed to chronic-phase disease and one progressed to blast-phase disease. Relatively few CRs occurred at daily doses of &amp;lt; 200 mg. Drug treatment in this study is long term. The authors recommended that in future studies, a daily dose of at least 400 mg should be used. Cytogenetic analysis showed that 31% of patients (17 of 54) receiving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; (&gt;/= 300 mg/day) had a major cytogenetic response (0 to 35% of 20 bone marrow cell metaphases were Ph-positive). The median time to achieving best cytogenetic response was 148 days (range 48 to 331 days). One of seven patients who had a complete cytogenetic response (no Ph-positive cells amongst 20 metaphases) also tested negative for BCR-ABL mRNA, as assayed by polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A dose-escalating pilot study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; in the treatment of blast-crisis CML and Ph-positive ALL included 58 patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419712"&gt;419712&lt;/ulink&gt;]. CML patients were enlisted irrespective of prior therapy, while only ALL patients who had relapsed or not responded to conventional therapy were treated. Of 38 patients with myeloid phenotype, four showed a complete hematological response and 17 showed a decrease in marrow blasts to &amp;lt;/= 15%. Of the 21 myeloid patients showing a response, nine subsequently relapsed and seven were in remission with follow-up times of 101 to 349 days. Of 20 lymphoid phenotype patients (including ten Ph-positive ALL cases), four had a complete hematological response and ten had a marrow response. Of the 14 lymphoid phenotype patients showing a response, 12 relapsed within a median of 58 days after initiation of treatment. The authors concluded that optimal treatment of patients with blast-crisis CML or Ph-positive ALL will probably involve &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; in combination with other therapeutic agents.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) occur infrequently but are notable for being: (i) highly variable in clinical course, but with the potential to metastasise even if apparently benign; (ii) generally unresponsive to chemotherapy; and, (iii) frequently expressing mutant, constitutively active c-KIT. A recent report by Joensuu et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419734"&gt;419734&lt;/ulink&gt;] documented the case of a woman with a rapidly progressive metastatic GIST that was refractory to conventional chemotherapy and that expressed a mutant c-KIT produced by a deletion in exon 11. Following commencement of treatment with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; (400 mg/day), two large liver metastases began to shrink within 2 weeks, no new lesions appeared and six out of 28 liver metastases disappeared. The patient showed minimal toxicity from &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; and continued to improve during 11 months of treatment. There has been a subsequent report of excellent responses in other cases of GISTs and it has been suggested that mutations in exon 11 of c-KIT are predictive for a positive response to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419717"&gt;419717&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;Worldwide phase II trials commenced in August 1999 for CML patients in accelerated phase [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="340410"&gt;340410&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 1999, a worldwide phase II study, conducted at 19 sites in the US and Europe, was initiated and involved CML patients refractory to or intolerant of IFN [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="357020"&gt;357020&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This phase II study involving 234 patients included 154 patients with CML in the accelerated phase, who had been treated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; for at least 4 weeks. The overall hematological response rate at 4 weeks was 78%, including 22 patients who had achieved a CR.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Results of a phase II study to determine the safety and antileukemic effects of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; in patients with Ph-positive CML in myeloid blast crisis were also to be presented. Preliminary data were based on 94 patients, 44 of whom had received prior treatment for blast crisis and 50 of whom were untreated. In the previously untreated patients, the overall response rates were 48 and 47% at 4 and 8 weeks of therapy with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;, respectively. In those who had received prior therapy for blast crisis, the response rates were 38 and 33%, respectively. Preliminary results indicated that the agent was well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391980"&gt;391980&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase II, open-label study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; involving 532 patients with Ph-positive CML who had failed IFN therapy, preliminary bone marrow cytogenetic results were available for 388 patients at 3 months. The findings demonstrated an overall cytogenetic response rate of 37%. In 290 patients who had completed 6 months of therapy at the time of the analysis, preliminary data suggested an overall response rate of 56%. It was shown that 23% of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;-treated subjects achieved a complete cytogenetic response at 6 months, compared with 3% receiving IFNalpha [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391980"&gt;391980&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="392072"&gt;392072&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="394126"&gt;394126&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In another open-label phase II trial, which involved 233 patients with accelerated-phase CML, patients received 400 or 600 mg/day of the drug. The overall hematological response rate was 91%; a CR with peripheral blood recovery was seen in 44% of patients, and 63% without peripheral blood recovery. Of the 210 evaluable patients, 14% achieved a complete cytogenetic response. One-year survival was estimated at 74%, although this was not confirmed at this time [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="392072"&gt;392072&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="394065"&gt;394065&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase II study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; (400 or 600 mg po twice daily for 24 months) in patients with GISTs, autophosphorylation of mutant and wild-type c-KIT was inhibited. The drug was generally well tolerated, with 25% of patients requiring dose reductions or discontinuation. Toxicities included gastrointestinal-tumor-related bleeding, hepatotoxicicty, neutropenia, infection and edema (all at 5%), but there were no deaths due to the treatment. The overall response rate was 68% for the 600-mg dose and 50% for the 400-mg dose, while there was 26% stable disease for an overall tumor control rate of 85%. Patients with mutations in c-KIT were found to have a higher chance of responding; the response rate was 29% if there was no mutation, 78% if exon 11 was mutated, and there was an intermediate response if exon 9 was mutated [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="411420"&gt;411420&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="23137"&gt;Novartis&lt;/ulink&gt; released further phase II data from &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;'s pivotal registration trials, which demonstrated continued increases in response rates for patients with all three stages of CML. In chronic- accelerated- and blast-crisis-phase CML, after failure of IFNalpha therapy, patients achieved a 91, 69 and 52% hematological response rate, respectively. Even more critically, the proportion of patients in chronic- accelerated- and blast-crisis-phase CML achieving a cytogenetic response, increased from 49 to 55%, 63 to 69% and 26 to 29%, respectively. Of the chronic-phase CML patients, the estimated proportion of surviving patients after one year of treatment was 98%. In the accelerated phase, 70% remained free of progression to the blast-crisis phase after one year of treatment. For the blast-crisis study population, the median survival rate was 7 months [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="413858"&gt;413858&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;Phase III studies involving newly diagnosed CML patients are being conducted in North America, Europe and Australia [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="392492"&gt;392492&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition, a European phase III trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; in the treatment of GISTs has commenced, comparing doses of 400 mg po daily and 400 mg po twice daily; 137 patients had been accrued by May 2001 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="411389"&gt;411389&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No data are currently available for these trials.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;A phase I trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment of chronic-phase CML patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419715"&gt;419715&lt;/ulink&gt;] and a pilot study of patients with blast-crisis-phase CML or Ph-positive ALL [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419712"&gt;419712&lt;/ulink&gt;] showed similar spectra of adverse reactions. The drug was generally well tolerated and a maximum tolerated dose was not identified. In the chronic-phase CML study (n = 83), at the highest doses (600 to 1000 mg) the most common adverse effects were nausea (59% of patients), edema (55%), diarrhea (38%) and vomiting (34%). Even at the highest doses, however, these adverse effects were generally grade 1 (mild) or grade 2 (moderate). Two patients taking 600 mg once daily, one patient taking 800 mg, and one patient taking 1000 mg had grade-3 anemia. At doses &amp;gt; 200 mg, grade-3 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 16 and 14% of patients, respectively. Seven patients showed liver enzyme elevations of grade 2 or higher. These elevations were reversed in some patients during treatment, while in others they were persistent and required interruption of therapy or reduction in dose.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;The excellent response rate achieved by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; in the treatment of chronic-phase CML patients has received wide &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="31231"&gt;acclaim&lt;/ulink&gt; in both the medical literature and the popular press (eg, [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419717"&gt;419717&lt;/ulink&gt;]). It is clear from the evidence available that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; has advantages over IFNalpha, the previous best treatment for chronic-phase CML, such as reduced toxicity, more rapid hematological response, higher rate of cytogenetic response and oral administration. It will be important to see whether these advantages translate into an improved life expectancy and whether long-term treatment of patients with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; is without serious side effects. There is already evidence that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt;, through its ability to inhibit other kinases such as c-KIT, may have a broader usefulness in cancer treatment than initially envisaged. Much remains to be learnt about optimal use of the drug, particularly in the area of combination chemotherapy. Advances in the latter area may see &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; used more successfully for treatment of Ph-positive acute leukemias.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="23137">Novartis AG</Company><Country id="JP">Japan</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="L"
