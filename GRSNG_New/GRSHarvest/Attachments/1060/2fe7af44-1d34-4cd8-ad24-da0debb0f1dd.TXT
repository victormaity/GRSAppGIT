This is, except for the urine samples, according to routine clinical practice. The diagnosis NEC will be established using the Bells criteria, with the presence of NEC defined as signs of pneumatosis intestinalis on the abdominal X-ray as assessed by an independent pediatric radiologist.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;For the serum analysis 100il of blood will suffice. This can be obtained during the daily routine bloodtests without any further burden for the child. Urine (preferably &amp;gt; 3 ml) can be directly obtained from the urine catheter or is collected via a small cotton wool placed into the diaper for at least one hour. Urine is subsequently removed from the cotton wool by compressing the cotton wool in a syringe.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At the same time as the interventions mentioned above, regional tissue oxygenation of the gut and the brain is evaluated using the NIRS system during the first 48 h (ie, after diagnosing NEC with Bell stage &amp;gt; 1). Blood and urine samples will be collected at ten different intervals (T1 to T10), without regard to the definitive diagnosis. If at certain intervals no routine blood samples are obtained, only urine is collected. In this way, the patients are not burdened.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;All surgical procedures will be performed in the UMC Groningen. When surgery becomes necessary and bowel is resected, small parts of the resected bowel and adjacent normal tissue will be collected. One part is snap frozen, the other part is stored in Formalin. Investigators will use routine Hematoxin-Eosin staining for histological evaluation and use immunohistochemistry for the determination of the localisation of the FABPs. These proteins will also be assessed on the mRNA and/or protein level. Investigators will also perform immunohistochemistry for carbohydrases to examine the gut maturity.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;During the operation, Visible Light Spectroscopy (VLS) will be used to assess the blood circulation and tissue oxygenation of the bowel at risk. This will help the surgeon in deciding which bowel segments to resect and whether it is safe to perform a primary anastomosis instead of a enterostomy.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/ProtocolDescription&gt;</ProtocolDescription></ProtocolAndOutcomes><AdverseEventsByInterventions></AdverseEventsByInterventions><DoseRouteByInterventions></DoseRouteByInterventions><SitesByCountries><SitesByCountry country="Netherlands"><Sites><Site><Contacts></Contacts></Site></Sites></SitesByCountry></SitesByCountries><PatientSegmentTerms><PatientSegmentByDisease><Disease>Inflammatory bowel disease</Disease><PatientSegments><PatientSegment><PatientSegment id="16641">Subjects with Necrotizing enterocolitis</PatientSegment></PatientSegment></PatientSegments></PatientSegmentByDisease></PatientSegmentTerms><TrialRegistries><Registry><Name id="1015">Netherlands Trial Registry (NTR)</Name><Identifiers><Identifier type="Secondary Organisational">NTR3239</Identifier></Identifiers></Registry></TrialRegistries><OutcomeMeasureTerms><PrimaryEndpoints><PrimaryEndpoint disease="Inflammatory bowel disease" id="44129"><Endpoint>Assessment of Laboratory/Diagnostic Measures</Endpoint></PrimaryEndpoint></PrimaryEndpoints><SecondaryEndpoints><SecondaryEndpoint disease="Inflammatory bowel disease" id="44129"><Endpoint>Assessment of Laboratory/Diagnostic Measures</Endpoint></SecondaryEndpoint><SecondaryEndpoint disease="Inflammatory bowel disease" id="44798"><Endpoint>Assessment of Biomarkers</Endpoint></SecondaryEndpoint></SecondaryEndpoints><OtherEndpoints><OtherEndpoint disease="Inflammatory bowel disease" id="44129"><Endpoint>Assessment of Laboratory/Diagnostic Measures</Endpoint></OtherEndpoint></OtherEndpoints></OutcomeMeasureTerms><EligibilityCriteriaTerms><InclusionCriteria><Inclusion disease="Inflammatory bowel disease" id="33202"><Criterion>Protocol Specified Other Inclusion Criteria</Criterion></Inclusion><Inclusion disease="Inflammatory bowel disease" id="33409"><Criterion>Subjects Fulfilling Protocol Specific Diagnostic Criteria</Criterion></Inclusion></InclusionCriteria><ExclusionCriteria><Exclusion disease="Inflammatory bowel disease" id="24740"><Criterion>Subjects with Co-morbid Conditions</Criterion></Exclusion><Exclusion disease="Inflammatory bowel disease" id="24744"><Criterion>Subjects with history of/scheduled to receive therapy for other indication</Criterion></Exclusion></ExclusionCriteria></EligibilityCriteriaTerms><FundersType><Type>Academic</Type></FundersType><ChangeHistory><Change type="added"><Date>2016-09-14T00:00:00Z</Date><Reason id="301">Clinical trial added</Reason></Change></ChangeHistory></ns2:com.thomsonreuters.ls.service.contract.soap.trials.v2.TrialRecordOutput>
