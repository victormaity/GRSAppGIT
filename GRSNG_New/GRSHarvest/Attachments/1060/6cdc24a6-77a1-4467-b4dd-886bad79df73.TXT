At that time,  the company planned to file the  NDA under subpart H for accelerated approval for serious or life-threatening illnesses [&lt;ulink linkID="1632283" linkType="Reference"&gt;1632283&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2009, the FDA awarded the drug Orphan status for multiple myeloma [&lt;ulink linkID="982568" linkType="Reference"&gt;982568&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By May 2009, the FDA had awarded the drug Orphan status for ovarian cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="1010126" linkType="Reference"&gt;1010126&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2010, the FDA awarded the drug Orphan status for  AML [&lt;ulink linkID="1075406" linkType="Reference"&gt;1075406&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2014, the drug was granted Orphan designation for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma including FLC [&lt;ulink linkID="1574509" linkType="Reference"&gt;1574509&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1621416" linkType="Reference"&gt;1621416&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;In January 2015, the company planned to file for Orphan drug designation for FLC later that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1626940" linkType="Reference"&gt;1626940&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2015, the COMP recommended granting the drug Orphan designation for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [&lt;ulink linkID="1681119" linkType="Reference"&gt;1681119&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2015, the EMA had granted the drug, Orphan designation for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma including FLC [&lt;ulink linkID="1702970" linkType="Reference"&gt;1702970&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Regulatory&gt;</value></Regulatory><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Fibrolamellar carcinoma&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2015, the company planned to conduct a  confirmatory clinical trial upon achieving positive results of  overall tumor response in a single-arm phase II trial in FLC patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1632283" linkType="Reference"&gt;1632283&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2015, the company planned to initiate the trial in 2015 [&lt;ulink linkID="1660457" linkType="Reference"&gt;1660457&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2014, a open-label, phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="209963" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02234986&lt;/ulink&gt;; 2076-CL-006) was expected to be initiated in November 2014, in patients with advanced FLC (expected n = 53) in the US, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ENMD-2076 oral capsule at 250 mg/day. At that time, the trial was expected to complete in June 2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="1621690" linkType="Reference"&gt;1621690&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2014, IND clearance had been obtained from the FDA  to conduct a phase II trial in  FLC. However, in December 2014, based on the investigator's meeting held recently and input from the key opinion leaders in the field of FLC, the company had decided to conduct a direct NDA registration trial. At that time, the company was granted a Type C meeting with the US FDA which was to be held in February 2015, to receive guidance and in finalizing the study design  [&lt;ulink linkID="1621416" linkType="Reference"&gt;1621416&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2015, the company planned to initiate the trial for the first-line treatment of FLC later that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1626940" linkType="Reference"&gt;1626940&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2015, the company received formal meeting minutes from the US FDA regarding the clinical  path about the design and would evaluate overall response rate as the primary endpoint in the  single-arm trial. The trial would be conducted as a Simon 2-stage trial with interim futility analysis released after 16 patients reached a clinical endpoint.  The company would terminate the trial and futility would be declared, if none of the patients experience a response. However, if one or more patients experience a response according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria, the trial would continue with additional patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1632283" linkType="Reference"&gt;1632283&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2015, CASI filed a new drug clinical trial application with the China FDA to conduct a phase II trial in FLC which would be an extension of  the US phase II trial. At that time,  the trial in the US was expected to be initiated in the third quarter of that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1666624" linkType="Reference"&gt;1666624&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2015, the trial was initiated in the US [&lt;ulink linkID="1621690" linkType="Reference"&gt;1621690&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2015, the first patient was dosed [&lt;ulink linkID="1709634" linkType="Reference"&gt;1709634&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2016, the China FDA had approved  to  conduct a phase II  trial in  FLC patients in China [&lt;ulink linkID="1761492" linkType="Reference"&gt;1761492&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2016, pre-specified interim analysis data were reported. The study met the stage 1 endpoint of objective response for non-futility. At that time, recruitment (expected n = 13) was initiated for the stage 2 part of the trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1788338" linkType="Reference"&gt;1788338&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1621690" linkType="Reference"&gt;1621690&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Breast cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;In July 2012, an open-label, safety/efficacy  phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="89108" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01639248&lt;/ulink&gt;; 2076-CL-005) was initiated in the US in previously treated   locally advanced or metastatic TNBC patients (expected n = 35) and at that time, the trial was  expected to  complete in January 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1311038" linkType="Reference"&gt;1311038&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1310827" linkType="Reference"&gt;1310827&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2012, patient enrollment was ongoing and at that time, the company planned to initiate patient enrollment in the second site 'soon' [&lt;ulink linkID="1343938" linkType="Reference"&gt;1343938&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2013, the company initiated the second site for the study [&lt;ulink linkID="1354311" linkType="Reference"&gt;1354311&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2013, CASI submitted a new drug clinical trial application with China's FDA (CFDA) to conduct global clinical trials in triple negative breast cancer patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1354708" linkType="Reference"&gt;1354708&lt;/ulink&gt;];  in July 2014, the CFDA approved the clinical trial application to initiate the dual-institutional phase II trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1578662" linkType="Reference"&gt;1578662&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In January 2015, the trial was planned to be initiated later that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1626940" linkType="Reference"&gt;1626940&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2015, the trial was initiated in China to assess the safety and efficacy of ENMD-2076 in  patient population with correlative bio-marker analysis. At that time,  data from  the US trial was  being collected [&lt;ulink linkID="1644756" linkType="Reference"&gt;1644756&lt;/ulink&gt;].  By April 2017, a total of 41 patients had been enrolled and the company had decided  to stop further patient enrollment in the US.  At that time, the dose escalation phase IIa  trial in China was expected to continue and reach the full enrollment target  in the third quarter of  2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1918248" linkType="Reference"&gt;1918248&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2017, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1311038" linkType="Reference"&gt;1311038&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2017, clinical data were presented at the 40th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in San Antonio, TX. The 6-month clinical benefit rate observed was 16.7% with partial response in 2 patients and stable disease for &amp;gt; months in 4 patients. The median duration of response or clinical benefit in these patients was 32 weeks. The 4-month clinical benefit rate reported was 27.8%.

In  May 2009, further data were presented at the 45th ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. A total of 25 patients had been enrolled in five dose cohorts (60 to 200 mg/m2/day). The most frequent toxicities (all grades, n = 22) were hypertension (36%), diarrhea (22%), fatigue and headache (both 14%). One patient experienced a DLT of grade 4 hypertension and grade 3 cholecystitis in the 60 mg/m2/day dose cohort. At 200 mg/m2/day, there were two DLTs of hypertension and neutropenia. Plasma concentration of ENMD-981693 (the active free base of ENMD-2076) was dose-linear. Four ovarian cancer and four CRC patients had achieved decreases up to 80% in either CA125 or CEA, respectively (all eight were associated with stable disease).

The activity was confirmed in vivo in MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 TNBC xenografts. Further, the cell lines with p53 mutation and increased p53 expression were more sensitive to the cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects of ENMD-2076 exposure compared to the cell lines with decreased p53 mutation [&lt;ulink linkID="1343938" linkType="Reference"&gt;1343938&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1344132" linkType="Reference"&gt;1344132&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2011, preclinical data were published. ENMD-2076 demonstrated selective activity against multiple kinases including Aurora A, VEGFRs and FGFRs. In tumor xenograft models derived from breast, colon, melanoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma cell lines, oral ENMD-2076 demonstrated induction of  regression or complete inhibition of tumor growth [&lt;ulink linkID="1165808" linkType="Reference"&gt;1165808&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1159298" linkType="Reference"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2010, preclinical data on ENMD-2076 were published.

HT-29 CRC cell line xenografts treated with either vehicle or the drug (100 or 200 mg/kg, po) for 28 days induced tumor growth inhibition initially and subsequently caused  tumor regression. Tumor growth inhibition was also observed in 3-patient-derived xenograft models treated with the drug (100 mg/kg). Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data showed significant tumor blanching, indicating a loss of vascularity and substantial reductions in tumor vascular permeability and perfusion. 18 fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) showed significant decreases in FDG uptake at treatment days (3, 21) and Ki-67 values demonstrated a marked reduction in tumor proliferation.

Mitosis is a major driver in cancer development and progression, and key regulators of mitosis, the Aurora kinases, are upregulated in various human cancers and represent therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer. &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="21794"&gt;EntreMed&lt;/ulink&gt; is developing ENMD-2076, an orally bioavailable, Aurora kinase inhibitor. Besides inhibiting Aurora kinases, ENMD-2076 also inhibits other cancer-relevant kinases that are linked with cancer growth and/or survival, and angiogenesis, providing scope for development in various cancer indications. ENMD-2076 exhibited both antimitotic and anti-angiogenic modes of action in xenograft tumor models. Clinical development has been initiated in patients with advanced cancer and promising results were observed in patients with ovarian cancer treated with ENMD-2076 in a phase I clinical trial. ENMD-2076 advanced into phase II trials in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian or peritoneal cancer. Further indications being developed include multiple myeloma and other hematological malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia. If proven successful in the treatment of cancer, ENMD-2076 will provide patients with a much-needed new treatment option.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Cancer is a disease of uncontrolled cellular proliferation and, despite some progress in the treatment of specific cancers, an unmet medical need still exists for most indications and for the majority of cancers there are no available efficient treatments [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163709"&gt;1163709&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The overall 5-year relative survival rate for all cancer types from 1999 to 2006 in the US was 66.0%, with some cancers, such as pancreatic cancer (5.6%), contributing to a particularly poor survival rate compared with other cancers, such as leukemia (54.1%), multiple myeloma (MM; 38.2%) and ovarian cancer (45.6%) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163710"&gt;1163710&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1167474"&gt;1167474&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A proven approach for anticancer therapy is to target mitosis with agents such as microtubule-interacting cytotoxics, including vinca alkaloids or taxanes [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="838742"&gt;838742&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Despite success against some cancers, these drugs are not specific for mitotic cells and some of the associated side effects, such as neurotoxicity, relate to their mode of action [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="838742"&gt;838742&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Therefore, the impetus in recent cancer research has been to develop highly specific drugs against mitotic targets, such as the mitotic kinases, including members of the Cyclin-dependent kinases, Polo-like kinase and Aurora kinases. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (eg, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3472"&gt;alvocidib&lt;/ulink&gt;; &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20519"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/ulink&gt;) were the first of these antimitotic agents to enter clinical trials, followed by Aurora kinase inhibitors (eg, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="53081"&gt;danusertib&lt;/ulink&gt;; &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1013717"&gt;Nerviano Medical Sciences&lt;/ulink&gt;) and Polo-like kinase inhibitors (eg, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54454"&gt;BI-2536&lt;/ulink&gt;; &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="22546"&gt;Boehringer Ingelheim&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163711"&gt;1163711&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Aurora kinases belong to a small family of serine/threonine kinases that are key regulators of different steps in mitosis and meiosis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="584727"&gt;584727&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Three highly homologous Aurora kinases exist in mammals (denoted Aurora A, B and C). Despite the high degree of homology, Aurora A and B kinases have very distinctive localizations and functions. Aurora A kinase associates with the spindle poles to regulate the entry of a cell into mitosis, centrosome maturation and spindle assembly, whereas Aurora B kinase regulates chromosome-microtubule interactions, cohesion, spindle stability and cytokinesis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163713"&gt;1163713&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163714"&gt;1163714&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Aurora A kinase is frequently amplified in a variety of tumor types and displays oncogenic activity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="584732"&gt;584732&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Initially, Aurora A and B kinases were observed to be overexpressed in primary tumors of the breast and colon, and yet further studies revealed that they were upregulated in many other types of human cancers, indicating that Aurora kinase inhibitors may have broad application in the treatment of various cancers (reviewed in [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1020644"&gt;1020644&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163716"&gt;1163716&lt;/ulink&gt;]).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Recently, several reports linked Aurora kinases with the Myc transcription factors. For example, the levels of Aurora A and B kinase gene transcripts and proteins were highly elevated in c-Myc-driven B-cell lymphomas [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163717"&gt;1163717&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Also, Aurora A kinase has a critical function in the stabilization of N-Myc, which is of interest because amplification of the n-myc gene predicts poor prognosis and resistance to therapy in human neuroblastoma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163718"&gt;1163718&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, both N-Myc and Aurora A kinase are expressed at high levels in glioblastoma, astrocytoma and prostate cancer, and during the genesis of medulloblastoma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163719"&gt;1163719&lt;/ulink&gt;], indicating that stabilization of N-Myc by Aurora A kinase may not be restricted to a specific tumor type. In addition, both Aurora A kinase and N-Myc are implicated in the genesis of nonsolid cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163722"&gt;1163722&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163723"&gt;1163723&lt;/ulink&gt;]; supporting the view that stabilization of N-Myc may contribute to Aurora A kinase-dependent tumorigenesis.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The first Aurora kinase inhibitor to enter clinical development was &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="53081"&gt;danusertib&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1048575"&gt;1048575&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163725"&gt;1163725&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20518"&gt;NIH&lt;/ulink&gt; clinical trials registry now lists several other Aurora kinase inhibitor candidates for the treatment of patients with a wide range of cancer types, such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="53058"&gt;AT-9283&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="28026"&gt;Astex&lt;/ulink&gt;), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="50868"&gt;cenisertib&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="25471"&gt;Rigel Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt;), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="59910"&gt;GSK-1070916&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="21948"&gt;GlaxoSmithKline&lt;/ulink&gt;), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="57452"&gt;alisertib&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15938"&gt;Millennium Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20300"&gt;Takeda Pharmaceutical&lt;/ulink&gt;) and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="18694"&gt;barasertib&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="14190"&gt;AstraZeneca&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1020644"&gt;1020644&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1137129"&gt;1137129&lt;/ulink&gt;]). Besides inhibition of Aurora kinases, most of the Aurora kinase inhibitors in clinical development exhibit some degree of inhibitory cross-reactivity against other kinases, which might be a factor that will ultimately differentiate the activity and/or safety profiles of the compounds [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163716"&gt;1163716&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;ENMD-2076 is an Aurora kinase inhibitor in clinical development by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="21794"&gt;EntreMed&lt;/ulink&gt; (formerly &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1003989"&gt;Miikana Therapeutics&lt;/ulink&gt;) that has selectivity for Aurora A kinase over B and C [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163726"&gt;1163726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition to its antimitotic effects afforded by the inhibition of the Aurora kinases, ENMD-2076 has inhibitory cross-reactivity against multiple targets, including cancer-relevant kinases (eg, c-Kit, Flt-3 and Src) associated with cancer growth and/or survival, and growth factor signaling proteins (eg, VEGFR-2 and FGFR) that mediate anti-angiogenic effects [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1105374"&gt;1105374&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The capacity to inhibit multiple targets might create additional clinical opportunities for the development of this compound. Positive data from patients with ovarian cancer who were enrolled in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="35292"&gt;NCT00658671&lt;/ulink&gt;) of ENMD-2076 in patients with advanced cancer prompted the FDA to grant ENMD-2076 with orphan drug designation for ovarian cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1010126"&gt;1010126&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Subsequently, ENMD-2076 has advanced into a phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="65684"&gt;NCT01104675&lt;/ulink&gt;) in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian or peritoneal cancer.

This paper summarizes the available data on ENMD-2076.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;ENMD-2076 was discovered during SAR studies undertaken to obtain structurally distinct and active Aurora kinase inhibitors that were synthetically tractable, with low molecular weight [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="901794"&gt;901794&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Analogs prepared from three identified lead series with potent Aurora kinase activity (ie, aminopyrimidines, pyrimidones and vinylpyrimidines) were optimized to retain key Aurora kinase inhibitor-Aurora enzyme interactions (ie, multiple hydrogen and pi to pi bond interactions). Of the &amp;gt; 300 compounds initially identified, 40 had IC50 values against Aurora A kinase of &amp;lt; 100 nM and half maximal growth inhibitory (ie, GI50) values against a human colorectal cancer (CRC) HCT116 cell line of &amp;lt; 1 microM. A lead molecule from the vinylpyrimidine series, the ENMD-2076 free base (ENMD-981693), was further optimized as a tartrate salt producing ENMD-2076 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="901794"&gt;901794&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;ENMD-2076 (6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-N-(3-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-2-[(E)-2-phenylvinyl]pyrimidin-4-amine) was synthesized from 4,6-dichloro-2-methylthiopyrimidine via oxidation to a corresponding sulfonyl derivative [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3486307"&gt;WO-2007041358&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This was followed by a Grignard reaction with phenylacetylenylmagnesium bromide, sequential amination with 5-methyl-2-aminopyrazole and N-methylpiperazine, reduction of an acetylene group and conversion to the tartrate salt. A cold solution of 4,6-dichloro-2-methylthiopyrimidine in dichloromethane was treated in equal proportions with a solution of 3-chlorobenzoyl peroxide in dichloromethane and then stirred at room temperature to give the corresponding sulfonyl derivative. Phenylacetylenylmagnesium bromide in tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise to a solution of the sulfonyl derivative in tetrahydrofuran at - 20degC, allowed to warm to room temperature overnight and worked-up to give 4,6-dichloro-2-(phenylethynyl)pyrimidine. Condensation of dichloro-2-(phenylethynyl)pyrimidine with 5-methyl-2-aminopyrazole in the presence of sodium iodide and diisopropylethylamine in dimethylacetamide at 90degC afforded a pyrazole amine derivative, which was further coupled with N-methyl-piperazine in the presence of N,N-dimethylpyridin-4-amine and diisopropylethylamine at 100degC to furnish a piperazinyl derivative. The 2-(phenylethynyl)pyrimidine obtained was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran, cooled and treated with a solution of lithium aluminum hydride, and stirred at 0degC to room temperature for 12 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0degC, quenched with methanol, treated with saturated sodium potassium L-tartrate and worked-up to give ENMD-2076. An alternative synthesis of ENMD-2076 free base (ENMD-981693) starting from cinnamonitrile was also described [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3486307"&gt;WO-2007041358&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;Preclinical studies were undertaken with ENMD-2076 and ENMD-2076 free base, which have similar biological activities on a molar basis; a dose of ENMD-2076 free base multiplied by a factor of 1.51 is equivalent to a dose of ENMD-2076 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vitro&lt;/subtitle&gt;In biochemical assays that tested the activity of ENMD-2076 free base (1 microM) against a panel of 100 recombinant kinases, 15 kinases were inhibited with IC50 values of &amp;lt; 100 nM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="747739"&gt;747739&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="857872"&gt;857872&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="901794"&gt;901794&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1105374"&gt;1105374&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159126"&gt;1159126&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this analysis, ENMD-2076 demonstrated selective inhibition for Aurora A kinase over Aurora B kinase (IC50 = 14 versus 350 nM, respectively). Furthermore, potent activity was demonstrated against cancer-relevant kinases, including Flt-3 (IC50 = 1.86 nM), Src (IC50 = 20.2 nM), VEGFR-2 (IC50 = 58.2 nM), VEGFR-3 (IC50 = 15.9 nM), FGFR-1 (IC50 = 92.7 nM), FGFR-2 (IC50 = 70.8 nM), PDGFR-alpha (IC50 = 56.4 nM), colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (IC50 = 24.8 nM), c-Kit (IC50 = 120 nM), Abl (IC50 = 295 nM) and T3151-mutated Abl (IC50 = 81.0 nM) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;When tested for the modulation of specific kinases in appropriate cellular assays, ENMD-2076 free base demonstrated selective activity against Aurora A kinase (IC50 = 130 nM) over Aurora B kinase (IC50 = 450 nM), histone H3 (H3; an Aurora B substrate; IC50 = 650 nM) and Aurora C (IC50 = 530 nM) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="747739"&gt;747739&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="857872"&gt;857872&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="901794"&gt;901794&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1105374"&gt;1105374&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159126"&gt;1159126&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. ENMD-2076 free base also demonstrated activity against cancer-relevant kinases, including Flt-3 (IC50 = 28 nM), Src (IC50 = 3000 nM), VEGFR-2 (IC50 = 20 nM), FGFR-1 (IC50 = 600 nM), colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (IC50 = 600 nM) and c-Kit (IC50 = 40 nM), while demonstrating only partial inhibition of Abl and T3151-mutated Abl (IC50 = &gt;/= 25 microM in both instances). In further cellular assays, ENMD-2076 free base inhibited the proliferation of seven human solid tumor cell lines (IC50 values ranged from 120 to 700 nM), a HUVEC cell line (IC50 = 15 nM) and ten human leukemia cell lines (IC50 values ranged from 2.5 to 53 nM) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1105374"&gt;1105374&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The inhibition of angiogenic kinases was further evaluated in VEGF- and FGR-stimulated HUVEC cells; ENMD-2076 inhibited VEGF- and FGR-induced proliferation of HUVEC cells with IC50 values of 76 and 139 nM, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In flow cytometry assays with a human leukemic monocyte lymphoma U937 cell line used to evaluate Aurora A kinase functional inhibition by ENMD-2076 free base (0.4 to 2 microM), a dose-dependent increase in the number of treated U937 cells in G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction was observed compared with control cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In further assays with a human pancreatic carcinoma PANC1 cell line, ENMD-2076 free base (20 and 200 nM) decreased the average cellular intercentrosomal distance from baseline by 6.9 and 8.9 microm for the respective concentrations compared with control cells, and treated cells exhibited abnormal mitotic spindle formation. These data cumulatively indicated selective inhibition of Aurora A kinase over Aurora B kinase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The potency of ENMD-2076 was evaluated against seven human MM cell lines and primary CD138+ (a plasma cell marker) MM cell lines derived from two patients with MM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="910962"&gt;910962&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968087"&gt;968087&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;]. ENMD-2076 (0.5 to 20 microM) demonstrated time- and dose-dependent cytotoxicity against MM cell lines, with mean LC50 (lethal concentration against 50% of cells) values of 6.9 and 2.99 microM at 24 and 72 h, respectively. Similar cytotoxicity was exhibited against primary CD138+ MM cell lines, with a mean LC50 value of 7.06 microM at 24 h. In Annexin V/propidium iodide staining experiments with a human MM MM1R cell line, incubation of cell cultures with ENMD-2076 free base (5 microM) significantly increased apoptosis of cells compared with control cells cultured with DMSO; at 6 and 24 h, treated cell cultures exhibited 59.09 and 61.80% of cell death, respectively, compared with controls (p &amp;lt; 0.001 in both instances) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Western blot analysis of cell lysates from the MM1R cell line treated with ENMD-2076 free base (1 and 5 microM) demonstrated induction of apoptosis with activation of caspase-9, -8 and -3, and PARP cleavage at both concentrations at 6 h compared with control cell lysates [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="910962"&gt;910962&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968087"&gt;968087&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, Q-VD-OPh (20 microM), significantly inhibited ENMD-2076 free base (1 to 10 microM)-induced apoptosis of MM1R cells compared with control cells; the most potent effect at 6 h was observed in cells cultured at a 5- and 10-microM concentration level, and at 24 h, all concentrations were potent (p &amp;lt; 0.05 in comparisons of percent cell viability with and without inhibitor, at all ENMD-2076 free base concentrations). Treated cells also exhibited a loss of mitochondria membrane potential (a hallmark of apoptosis; specific data not available) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The effects of ENMD-2076 free base on the levels of apoptosis proteins were more closely examined in cell lysates from the MM1R cell line with Western blotting [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="910962"&gt;910962&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968087"&gt;968087&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a 48-h experiment, ENMD-2076 free base (1 to 10 microM) treatment of MM1R cells dose-dependently increased the cleavage of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic family member Mcl-1 compared with controls at 6 h. However, over the time course of the experiment, there were no observed effects on the expression levels of other examined Bcl-2 apoptosis proteins, including the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and the pro-apoptotic Bax, Bad and Bim. In contrast, a time- and dose-dependent decrease in the expression levels of the inhibitors of apoptosis survivin and XIAP was observed compared with controls, with a less pronounced effect for survivin than for XIAP [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;IL-6 and IGF-1 promote MM cell growth and survival through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, stimulating the activation of Akt through phosphorylation and, in turn, phosphorylated (p-) Akt-mediated phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic downstream effector proteins in the pathway, leading to the inactivation of the pro-apoptotic effects of the pathway [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1177559"&gt;1177559&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Thus, the effect of ENMD-2076 free base on the PI3K/Akt pathway was investigated in MM1R cell lysates with Western blotting [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="910962"&gt;910962&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968087"&gt;968087&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a 24-h experiment, ENMD-2076 free base (1 to 10 microM) treatment of MM1R cells downregulated the levels of (p-Bad, p-Foxo1a and p-Gsk3-beta in cell lysates in a time- and dose-dependent manner compared with control lysates. The effect was most pronounced at a 5-microM concentration level at 24 h. In another experiment, culture of MM1R cells with IL-6 (10 ng/ml for 24 h) induced increased levels of p-Akt, p-p70S6 kinase, p-p4EBP1, p-Bad, p-Foxo1a and p-Gsk3-beta in cell lysates compared with control cell lysates, and coculture with ENMD-2076 free base (1 and 5 microM for 24 h) prevented IL-6-induced phosphorylation of these proteins; the effect was most pronounced at the 5-microM concentration level. Furthermore, in MM1R cells that were cultured with IL-6 (10 ng/ml), ENMD-2076 free base (0.5 to 20 microM) induced dose-dependent apoptosis compared with control cells, indicating that ENMD-2076 effected IL-6-mediated anti-apoptotic cell signaling. In a further experiment, ENMD-2076, compared with control cells, downregulated levels of p-STAT3 at Ser727, which is mediated by the downstream PI3K/Akt pathway effector mTOR (specific data were not available). Taken cumulatively, these data indicated that ENMD-2076 exerted an inhibitory effect on the PI3K/Akt pathway. In additional analyses, ENMD-2076 had no observed effect on the Jak2/STAT3 or MAPK/ERL pathways [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Immunofluorescence detection of p-Aurora A kinase at Thr288 and of p-H3 at Ser10 was used to evaluate Aurora A and B kinase inhibition, respectively, in the MM1R cell line cultured with ENMD-2076 free base (1 to 10 microM for 24 h) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="910962"&gt;910962&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968087"&gt;968087&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At 24 h, detection of p-Aurora A kinase and p-H3 significantly decreased in cells treated with 5 and 10 microM of ENMD-2076 free base compared with control cells cultured with DMSO (p = 0.05), indicating the inhibition of both Aurora A and B kinases. No significant changes in the levels of p-Aurora A kinase or p-H3 were observed with 1-microM ENMD-2076 free base compared with controls. In a 48-h experiment, ENMD-2076 free base (1 microM) treatment of MM1R cells induced a significant percentage of cells to enter G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest compared with control cells cultured with DMSO; the most pronounced effect was observed at 24- and 48-h time points, when Aurora kinase inhibition was maximal, with 49.49 and 71.99% of cells in G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest, respectively, compared with 9.26% of control cells (p &amp;lt; 0.01) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;ENMD-2076 free base (0.25 to 1.0 microM) combined with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="27572"&gt;lenalidomide&lt;/ulink&gt; (2.5 to 10.0 microM), an analog of thalidomide that has anti-angiogenic and antiproliferative activity, demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity in MTT assays at 72 h against human MM cell lines, including a plasmacytoma H929 cell line, and MM1R and MM1S cell lines, compared with controls [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968087"&gt;968087&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The combination indices (based on a Chou-Talalay method) were 0.362, 0.315 and 0.404 for the respective cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968087"&gt;968087&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In an evaluation of the effect of ENMD-2076 on human breast cancer (BC) cell lines, the cell proliferation of 11 cell lines that were HER2+ or triple- (ie, negative for estrogen, progesterone and HER2/neu receptor gene expression) was inhibited with IC50 values ranging from 0.63 to &amp;gt; 5 microM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1058938"&gt;1058938&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The insensitivity of cell lines to ENMD-2076 was associated with HER2 and Aurora A gene amplification. ENMD-2076 treatment of an ENMD-2076-sensitive, triple-, human BC MDA-MB-231 cell line (ENMD-2076 IC50 = 0.63 microM) increased mean cell apoptosis in a caspase-3/-7 assay at 72 h by ~ 2.5-fold compared with controls (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Cell apoptosis over the control levels was not observed in a similarly treated ENMD-2076-insensitive, triple+, human BC HCC1419 cell line (ENMD-2076 IC50 = &amp;gt; 5.0 microM). When ENMD-2076 (0.25 to 1.25 microM) was tested in combination with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6386"&gt;trastuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (0.1 and 1.0 microg/ml), a mAb that interferes with the HER2/neu receptor, against ENMD-2076-insensitive, HER2+, human BC BT474 and SKBR3 cell lines (ENMD-2076 IC50 = &amp;gt; 5.0 and 1.25 microM, respectively), increasing concentrations of both agents synergistically inhibited proliferation in tests at 96 h compared with control cells. Treatment of BT474 and SKBR3 cell lines with ENMD-2076 alone induced cellular G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest at 72 h compared with control cells, and cells exposed to ENMD-2076 combined with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6386"&gt;trastuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; also underwent cellular G2/M cell cycle arrest, but to a lesser extent. Treatment of ENMD-2076-sensitive (ENMD-2076 IC50 = 0.63 and 1.0 microM, respectively), triple-, human BC MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines with ENMD-2076 (0.25 to 1.25 microM) in combination with the alkylating agent &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44383"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; (0.63 to 2.5 microg/ml) similarly resulted in a concentration-dependent synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation in tests at 96 h compared with control cells. In similar experiments, combinations with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2953"&gt;docetaxel&lt;/ulink&gt; failed to produce synergistic effects (specific data were not available) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1058938"&gt;1058938&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vivo&lt;/subtitle&gt;Angiogenesis&lt;br/&gt;The inhibition of angiogenic kinases by ENMD-2076 (ENMD-2076 free base) was evaluated using an FGF (0.5 microg/ml)-stimulated matrigel angiogenesis model in C57B16 mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Treatment of FGF-stimulated matrigel implanted mice with ENMD-2076 (25 to 150 mg/kg/day po, qd for 10 days) at the time of implantation decreased vessel growth at all dose levels by the end of the study compared with mice receiving a sterile water control. When treatment was delayed for 7 days, ENMD-2076 induced the regression of new vessel growth in the FGF-stimulated matrigel implant at all dose levels by the end of the study compared with control mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Solid tumors&lt;br/&gt;In solid tumors, the antitumor efficacy of ENMD-2076 was assessed in CB17 SCID mice xenografted with a human melanoma A375 cell line (1 x 10(6) to 5 x 10(6) sc) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Mice bearing tumors (100 mm3 on post-implantation day (PID) 21) and treated with ENMD-2076 (35, 76, 151 or 302 mg/kg/day po, qd) had dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 13, 42, 81 and 98%, for the respective doses on treatment day (TD) 18, relative to mice receiving a sterile water control. The TGI values were significant in the 151- and 302-mg/kg/day dose cohorts [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;ENMD-2076 was evaluated in another model of solid tumors in CB17 SCID mice xenografted with a human colon carcinoma HT29 cell line (1 x 10(6) to 5 x 10(6) sc) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Mice bearing tumors (400 mm3 on PID 18) and treated with ENMD-2076 (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day po, qd) had significantly different TGI values of 57, 62 and 90%, for the respective doses on TD 27, relative to mice receiving a sterile water control [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In another study, ENMD-2076 was assessed in multiple models of CRC generated in athymic nude mice xenografted with the HT29 cell line (2.5 x 10(6) sc), primary CRC tumor explants from patients or metastatic tumor (of peritoneal and pelvic origin) explants from patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="950595"&gt;950595&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1105374"&gt;1105374&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Tumor explants derived from patients contained KRas mutations. In mice bearing HT29 tumors (100 to 150 mm3) or tumors derived from explants (150 to 300 mm3) that were treated with ENMD-2076 (100 and 200 mg/kg/day po by gavage, qd for 28 days), significant antitumor activity with tumor stabilization and regression was observed in all cases at study completion, independent of KRas mutational status of the xenograft, compared with the tumor activity observed in mice receiving a sterile water control (p = 0.05) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1105374"&gt;1105374&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Anti-CRC activity of ENMD-2076 was additionally evaluated in athymic nude mice using the HCT116 cell line (1 x 10(6) to 5 x 10(6) sc), mice bearing tumors (200 mm3 on PID 10) and treated with ENMD-2076 free base (100 or 200 mg/kg/day po, qd) had significantly different TGI values (TGI = 89% in the 100-mg/kg/day dose cohort; data were not available for the 200-mg/kg/day dose cohort) at TD 20 relative to mice receiving a sterile water control [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At a 200-mg/kg/day dose, an overall tumor regression of 54% was observed in treated mice. Additionally, a syngeneic mouse CRC model was generated in Balb/C mice with a murine colon carcinoma CT26 cell line (1 x 10(6) to 5 x 10(6) sc). In mice bearing tumors (120 mm3 on PID 9) that were treated with ENMD-2076 (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day po, qd), TGI values (TGI = - 8, 21 and 24% at the respective doses) were dose-dependent on TD 26, but not significantly increased relative to mice receiving a sterile water control, and tumor regression was not observed [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;ENMD-2076 was assessed in an orthotopic model of BC in CB17 SCID mice implanted with a triple- BC MDA-MB-231 (1 x 10(6) to 5 x 10(6) sc) cell line into the mammary fat pads [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Mice bearing tumors (150 mm3 on PID 21) and treated with ENMD-2076 free base (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg/day po, qd) had significantly different TGI values of 62, 94 and 99%, for the respective doses on TD 27, relative to mice receiving a sterile water control. A cohort of mice with greater tumor volume (300 mm3 on PID 32) that was treated with ENMD-2076 (75 or 302 mg/kg/day po, qd) had significantly different TGI values of 54 and 99%, for the respective doses on TD 18, relative to control mice. Two further cohorts of mice with greater tumor volumes (450 and 1740 mm3 on PIDs 33 and 50, respectively) were treated with ENMD-2076 at 200 mg/kg/day (po, qd). In mice with 450-mm3 tumors, treatment induced 96% TGI on TD 17 relative to control mice. While in mice with 1740 mm3 tumors, tumor regression was observed in 7 mice in a cohort of 9, with an overall regression of 54% on TD 14 relative to control mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Studies were conducted to evaluate ENMD-2076 (50 to 200 mg/kg/day po, qd for 16 days) in combination with cisplatin (1 to 6 mg/kg/week ip, qw for 3 weeks) using the BC xenograft model generated by orthotopic implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells or multidrug-resistant BC MDA-MB-231mdr1 cells in to the mammary fat pads of CB17 SCID mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159126"&gt;1159126&lt;/ulink&gt;]. All treatments commenced when tumor volumes had reached 400 to 500 mm3. In both xenograft models, combination treatment resulted in synergistic and dose-dependent antitumor effects, when assessed by overall tumor regression, compared with treatment with the agents alone. In mice with MDA-MB-231mdr1 xenograft tumors, tumor regression (tumor/control = - 0.220) was exhibited by 100% of mice receiving combined treatment (ENMD-2076 at 200 mg/kg/day and cisplatin at 6 mg/kg/day) compared with 78 and 0% of mice receiving ENMD-2076 or cisplatin single agents, respectively (tumor/control = 0.22 and 0.36, respectively). In an immunohistochemical study of MDA-MB-231mdr1 xenograft tumors excised from mice at necropsy, tumors from mice in the combined treatment cohort had decreased staining for biomarkers of angiogenesis (ie, an increased area of staining for the endothelial marker CD31), proliferation (Ki-67+) and apoptosis (ie, increased labeling of DNA strand breaks) compared with tumors from mice in the single agent cohorts or controls [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159126"&gt;1159126&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Multiple myeloma&lt;br/&gt;The antitumor activity of ENMD-2076 in MM was evaluated in CB17 SCID mice xenografted with the human plasmacytoma H929 cell line (1 x 10(6) to 5 x 10(6) sc), which contains a t(4;14) chromosomal translocation resulting in ectopic expression of FGFR-3, associated with poor prognosis in patients with MM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163742"&gt;1163742&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In addition, the number of CD34+ tumor cells was significantly decreased in all dose cohorts and a dose-dependent decrease in p-H3 was observed, compared with tumors from control mice in both cases. Interestingly, inhibition of p-FGFR-3 was observed in cell lysates prepared from tumors in the 100- and 200-mg/kg/day dose cohorts using Western blotting. This effect might contribute to the antitumor activity of ENMD-2076 in MM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;The effect of ENMD-2076 on bone marrow cells was investigated by comparing the activity of ENMD-2076 against human CD34+ progenitor cells derived from the blood of two healthy volunteers, and against the MM1R and MM1S cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;]. ENMD-2076 (0.5 to 20 microM for 72 h) was more cytotoxic against MM cell lines (mean LC50 = 4.25 microM) in an MTS cell viability assay at 72 h (as described in the Preclinical development section) than against human CD34+ progenitor cells (mean LC50 = 16.37 microM; p = 0.007). The effects were dose dependent in both cases. Further assessment was undertaken using erythroid and myeloid hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from the bone marrow of NOD/SCID mice xenografted with the H929 cell line. In colony forming assays at 30 days, ENMD-2076 (50 to 200 mg/kg/day po by gavage, qd for 30 days) exerted minimal effects on the viability of erythroid and myeloid hematopoietic progenitor cells at any dose compared with progenitor cells from mice receiving a sterile water control. These experiments cumulatively indicated the existence of a therapeutic window that spared bone marrow progenitors [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;ENMD-2076 administered orally up to 200 mg/kg/day for 28 days was well tolerated in mouse xenograft models, without causing outward signs of morbidity or body-weight loss [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="747739"&gt;747739&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="950595"&gt;950595&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968087"&gt;968087&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1105374"&gt;1105374&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116055"&gt;1116055&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159126"&gt;1159126&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, a twice-daily oral dosing regimen with 200 mg/kg (400 mg/kg/day) in mice xenografted with the HCT116 cell line caused body-weight loss and the death of 22% (2/9) of mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1105374"&gt;1105374&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, a daily-oral dosing regimen with 302 mg/kg in mice xenografted with the A375 cell line caused body-weight loss and the death of 10% (1/10) of mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1105374"&gt;1105374&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Body-weight loss was also observed in mice orthotopically implanted with the MDA-MB-231 cell line and treated with an ENMD-2076 daily-oral dosing regimen of 302 mg/kg/day [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1159298"&gt;1159298&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The preclinical toxicology to support the initiation of the clinical assessment of ENMD-2076 included a 28-day continuous oral dosing toxicology study performed in rats and dogs (no specific dosing details were available) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163726"&gt;1163726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Gastrointestinal toxicities were observed in both species, with additional toxicities observed in rats, including liver function test abnormalities, bone marrow suppression and adrenal cortical changes. In addition, toxicities were observed at the cartilage/bone interface attributable to disruption of vascular invasion. Many of these changes were reversible after a 28-day recovery period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163726"&gt;1163726&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism and pharmacokinetics&lt;/subtitle&gt;In a preclinical ADME evaluation, ENMD-2076 was ~ 90% protein bound [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="901794"&gt;901794&lt;/ulink&gt;]. ENMD-2076 (1 microM) demonstrated no significant inhibition against a panel of five cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9*1 AND CYP3A4). In an evaluation of excretion pathways, ENMD-2076 demonstrated low to absent glucuronide conjugation in assays with liver microsomes derived from five species. Oxidation was the predominant excretion pathway determined in the species tested (no further details were available) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="901794"&gt;901794&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The pharmacokinetic profile of ENMD-2076 free base (50 or 200 mg/kg/day po, qd from PID 32) was assessed in CB17 SCID mice xenografted with MDA-MB-231 cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="901794"&gt;901794&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The Cmax and AUC values increased dose dependently, with Cmax values of 1483 and 3870 ng/ml at 50 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, and AUC values of 8208 and 32805 ng.h/ml, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="901794"&gt;901794&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Pharmacokinetic data were reported from a phase I clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="35292"&gt;NCT00658671&lt;/ulink&gt;) assessing ENMD-2076 (60 to 200 mg/m2/day po for 28 days/cycle ) in patients (n = 67) with advanced cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1006592"&gt;1006592&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163726"&gt;1163726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The kinetics of ENMD-2076 absorption after single (day 1) and repeated (day 28) doses were rapid with Tmax values ranging from 3.0 to 7.8 h and from 2.7 to 4.7 h, respectively. The estimated t1/2 value was unaltered regardless of dose, but the t1/2 values recorded after a single dose were prolonged by repeated dosing; the t1/2 values ranged from 27.3 to 38.3 h and from 44.9 to 53.1 h, respectively. Noncompartmental modeling demonstrated dose-dependent Cmax and AUC0-infinity values after single and repeated dosing. The Cmax values ranged from 64 to 157 ng/ml on day 1 and from 218 to 558 ng/ml on day 28, and the AUC0-infinity values ranged from 3.16 to 5.94 microg.h/ml and from 15.26 to 34.60 microg.h/ml, respectively. ENMD-2076 accumulation (Cmax day 28/Cmax day 1 = average 3.4) was observed after repeated dosing for all doses during the first cycle of treatment, but no further accumulation was noted in patients who received &amp;gt; two treatment cycles. Systemic clearance and apparent volume of distribution values increased dose dependently and were higher after a single dose than after repeated dosing at all dose levels; the clearance values ranged from 37.9 to 64.3 l/h on day 1 and from 9.1 to 14.0 l/h on day 28, and the volume of distribution values ranged from 1707 to 2436 l and from 600 to 907 l, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163726"&gt;1163726&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Pharmacokinetic data were further reported from this trial for ENMD-2060, an active metabolite of ENMD-2076 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163726"&gt;1163726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In patient plasma, the Tmax value after a single dose of ENMD-2076 (same dose range) was reached within 6.0 to 19.4 h and after repeated doses (on day 28) within 2.7 to 11.4 h. The t1/2 values for ENMD-2060 were longer than for ENMD-2076 and after repeated dosing ranged from 89.9 to 139.0 h. A linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between t1/2 values and dose level (p = 0.0171). The AUC0-infinity and Cmax values recorded for ENMD-2060 were not dose dependent; after repeated dosing the AUC0-infinity values ranged from 4.72 to 12.55 microg.h/ml and the Cmax values ranged from 29.4 to 95.0 ng/ml. In a further analysis of the pharmacokinetic variables of ENMD-2076 on days 1 and 28 and ENMD-2060 on day 28, there was a correlation on day 28 between patient weight and ENMD-2076 AUC0-infinity/fixed dose values (p = 0.00950), Cmax/fixed dose values (p = 0.0493) and apparent volume of distribution values (p = 0.0495). Furthermore, on day 28, patient weight also correlated with ENMD-2060 fixed-dose corrected Cmax values (p = 0.0093) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163726"&gt;1163726&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;A phase I, open-label, non-randomized, parallel-group-assignment, dose-escalation, multicenter clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="35292"&gt;NCT00658671&lt;/ulink&gt;; 2076-CL-001) was assessing ENMD-2076 (60 to 200 mg/m2/day po by capsule, in 5 dose levels using a 3 (or 4) + 3 (or 2) dose-escalation design in a continuous 28-day cycle until MTD; cycle 1 was followed by a 7-day observation period prior to continuation of 28-day cycles) in patients (n = 67, including 29 patients in an initial dose-escalation cohort and 38 patients in an expanded MTD cohort) with advanced cancer that was refractory to standard treatment, or for whom no therapy was curative or provided clinical benefit [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1006592"&gt;1006592&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163726"&gt;1163726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The trial included patients with CRC, ovarian, renal, pancreatic, cervical, breast and neuroendocrine tumors, and 67% of the patient cohort had received previous anti-angiogenic therapy. Of 58 patients evaluable for tumor response, 2 (3%) patients with ovarian cancer had a partial response (1 confirmed), 49 (85%) had stable disease and 7 (12%) had progressive disease. Of 20 patients with ovarian cancer, including 18 patients who were platinum resistant or treatment refractory, 12 (60%) experienced a partial response or had stable disease for &amp;gt; 12 weeks, and 9 (45%) had a 50% decrease from baseline in levels of CA-125, a diagnostic indicator for ovarian cancer. Of 19 patients with CRC, including patients with a KRas mutation, 5 (26%) had stable disease for &amp;gt; 12 weeks. No correlation between dose level and response was observed. The pharmacodynamic effects of ENMD-2076 treatment on soluble VEGFR-2 levels in patient plasma and p-H3 in patient skin biopsies were studied during cycle one. In all dose cohorts, the mean soluble VEGFR-2 levels measured on day 1 (8419 pg/ml) had decreased by day 28 (5600 pg/ml), demonstrating VEGFR-2 inhibition. The effect persisted through multiple treatment cycles, but the percentage decrease did not correlate with the percentage decrease in tumor size. Similarly, at the same time points, a reduction in p-H3, consistent with Aurora kinase inhibition, was not established in keratinocytes from nine patients treated with 160 mg/m2/day (the MTD) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163726"&gt;1163726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This trial was ongoing at the time of publication, but not recruiting participants, and had an estimated completion date of June 2011.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase I, open-label, non-randomized, single-group-assignment, dose-escalation, single-center clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="55655"&gt;NCT00904787&lt;/ulink&gt;; 2076-CL-003) was assessing ENMD-2076 (225 to 375 mg/day po by capsule, in a continuous 28-day cycle until MTD) in patients (n = 27 in four dose cohorts) with hematological malignancies who had relapsed or were refractory to standard treatment, or for whom no therapy was curative or provided a durable remission [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1059585"&gt;1059585&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1152348"&gt;1152348&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The trial included patients with AML (n = 26) and eosinophilia-associated chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 1), and 89% of the patient population had received a median of one to six prior treatment regimens. Of 20 patients evaluable for clinical response by International Working Group (IWG) criteria, there was a 20% overall response rate. An overall response was assigned to one patient with a Flt-3 internal tandem duplication mutation, common in AML, who achieved a transfusion-independent complete response with incomplete hematological recovery, and to three patients who achieved a morphological leukemia-free state with hematological improvement in platelet and/or erythroid responses. Additionally, four patients achieved a reduction in bone marrow blast count, ranging from 11 to 65%, compared with counts at treatment initiation. After an evaluation of data from this trial, the dose of ENMD-2076 recommended for phase II development was 225 mg/day po. In a pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis using peripheral blood and bone marrow from patients, all concentrations of ENMD-2076 (0.5 to 2.0 microM) decreased the activation of growth factor signaling proteins ERK, Akt, STAT-5 and S6 in most day 8 and 29 samples tested compared with samples analyzed at treatment initiation. This was particularly evident in samples from the patient who had a Flt-3 internal tandem duplication mutation and achieved a complete response. Another patient was reported to have responded similarly and thus, the authors speculated that the pattern of growth factor activation might have predictive value [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1152348"&gt;1152348&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This trial had an estimated completion date of December 2010, but was ongoing at the time of publication, although not recruiting participants.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase I, open-label, non-randomized, single-group-assignment, dose-escalation, single-center clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="38334"&gt;NCT00806065&lt;/ulink&gt;; 2076-CL-002) was assessing ENMD-2076 (150 to 325 mg/day po by capsule, in a continuous 28-day cycle until MTD; cycle 1 was followed by a 7-day observation period prior to continuation of 28-day cycles) in patients (estimated n = 30; in 3 cohorts using a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design) with MM who had relapsed or were refractory to standard treatment that included &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="27572"&gt;lenalidomide&lt;/ulink&gt; or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15954"&gt;bortezomib&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160884"&gt;1160884&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Interim data were reported from the first ten patients who had received a median of three prior treatment regimens. Efficacy was not achieved at the 150-mg/kg dose level, while one patient achieved stable disease at the 225-mg/kg dose level. After dose escalation to the 325-mg/day dose level, one of four patients achieved a partial response with a &amp;gt; 75% decrease in subcutaneous plasmacytoma volume and a 60% decrease in urinary kappa light chain excretion indicating reduced myeloma activity compared with levels at treatment initiation, and two patients achieved stable disease with a 19 to 21% decrease in plasma myeloma protein levels compared with levels at treatment initiation. Further data were awaited from this cohort after expansion with two patients. Pharmacodynamic analyses were ongoing to evaluate the effects of ENMD-2076 on p-H3 in patient CD138+ bone marrow plasma cells and on the PI3K signaling pathway in patient PBMC and endothelial cell precursors [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160884"&gt;1160884&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In the dose-escalation cohort (n = 29), hypertension (55%), nausea/vomiting (34%) and fatigue (31%) were the most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events. Patients in the 200-mg/m2/day dose cohort (n = 7) experienced grade 3 to 4 DLTs, including hypertension (n = 2) and myelosuppression characterized as neutropenia (n = 3), and the MTD was established as a 160-mg/m2/day dose. At the MTD, 33% of the patient cohort required a dose reduction because of toxicity. The most commonly reported adverse events in the expanded MTD cohort (n = 38) were similar to those reported in the dose-escalation cohort and included hypertension (55%), nausea/vomiting (42%) and fatigue (32%) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163726"&gt;1163726&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the phase I clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="55655"&gt;NCT00904787&lt;/ulink&gt;) that was assessing ENMD-2076 in patients with hematological malignancies, all 27 patients were evaluable for safety [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1059585"&gt;1059585&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1152348"&gt;1152348&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The most common nonhematological grade 3 or 4 adverse events, across all doses, were febrile neutropenia (26%) fatigue (15%), hypertension (7%), and an equal number of reports of constipation, nausea, abdominal pain and a confused state (all 4%). The DLT was defined as a nonhematological grade 3 to 4 fatigue, which was observed in two of six patients treated at the highest dose (375 mg/day). Upon dose de-escalation to 325 mg/day, three of nine patients developed grade 2 or 3 fatigue in the first two cycles. Thus, the 325-mg/day dose was deemed intolerable in this patient population. After dose de-escalation to 275 mg/day, further DLTs at grade 3 of typhilitis and syncope were reported in two of five patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1152348"&gt;1152348&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An interim safety report was disclosed from ten patients enrolled in the phase I clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="38334"&gt;NCT00806065&lt;/ulink&gt;) that was assessing ENMD-2076 in patients with MM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160884"&gt;1160884&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Grade 1 or 2 adverse events were more commonly reported in the 225- and 325-mg/day cohorts. Observed grade 3 adverse events included single reports of elevated lipase (during cycle one) by a patient in each of the 225- (n = 1 of 3) and 325-mg/day (n = 1 of 4) cohorts, and single reports of hypertension and thrombocytopenia by patients in the 325-mg/day (n = 1 each of 4) cohort [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160884"&gt;1160884&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Patent summary&lt;/subtitle&gt;ENMD-2076 was first claimed by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1003989"&gt;Miikana&lt;/ulink&gt; (ie, now &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="21794"&gt;EntreMed&lt;/ulink&gt;) in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3486307"&gt;WO-2007041358&lt;/ulink&gt;. This application has been granted in the US as &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3514737"&gt;US-07563787&lt;/ulink&gt; and has solid protection in this territory, after a US154 extension, until March 2027. The European equivalent, &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3648961"&gt;EP-01928456&lt;/ulink&gt;, had not yet been granted at the time of publication. No other cases appear to relate to ENMD-2076 specifically. However, in other cases, including &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3198714"&gt;WO-2006055831&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3722968"&gt;WO-2008154026&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA5610797"&gt;WO-2010062848&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1003989"&gt;Miikana&lt;/ulink&gt; claimed structurally-related compounds with the same mechanism of action.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;ENMD-2076 entered the Aurora kinase inhibitor field relatively late and has progressed rapidly through clinical development compared with other Aurora kinase inhibitors. In phase I clinical trials, ENMD-2076 plasma levels were judged sufficient for target modulation and this view was supported by the preclinical and clinical analyses of pharmacodynamic biomarker modulation, including Aurora A kinase and VEGFR-2 inhibition. A phase II trial in patients with ovarian cancer has already been initiated based on promising phase I results.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the evidence from preclinical xenograft models it remains unclear which mechanism, whether antiproliferative or anti-angiogenic, is specifically responsible for or contributes to the observed antitumor activities. Yet, the fact that ENMD-2076 may simultaneously target mitosis and angiogenesis makes it an interesting and unique compound. The inhibition of cancer-relevant signaling pathways could be a major driver of the observed anticancer activity, which gives ENMD-2076 potential in various cancer indications, including against the ectopic expression of FGFR-3 in the ongoing phase I clinical trial in patients with MM. The FGFR-3 translocation is observed in a subset of patients with MM that have particularly poor clinical outcome. Ectopic expression of FGFR-3 in MM might predict sensitivity to ENMD-2076 for future development in this indication that has a high unmet medical need. Another potential indication for ENMD-2076, based on the reported inhibitory activity against c-Kit, could be against constitutively-activated c-Kit in gastrointestinal stromal tumors [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="419730"&gt;419730&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In phase I clinical trials with ENMD-2076, episodes of hypertension were observed, which is a known side effect of other anti-angiogenic drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="770279"&gt;770279&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Interruption of VEGF signaling has not only been related to hypertension, but is also clinically used as a predictive biomarker in patients with NSCLC who are undergoing treatment with bevacizumab, a mAb against VEGF [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163740"&gt;1163740&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a solid tumor setting, neutropenia is an expected mechanism of action-related toxicity, which is also observed with most of the Aurora kinase inhibitors already in the clinic (reviewed in [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163727"&gt;1163727&lt;/ulink&gt;]). The permanent dosing regimen of ENMD-2076 that is currently under assessment needs careful dose adaption. If Aurora kinase inhibition is mainly responsible for efficacy, a shorter and more dose intensive schedule might be worth considering, with periods of interruption to allow for recovery from hematological toxicities. The risk of cardiotoxicity observed with inhibitors of other kinases, such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="12973"&gt;sunitinib&lt;/ulink&gt; that inhibits VEGFR-2, PDGFR-beta, c-Kit and Flt-3 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1177137"&gt;1177137&lt;/ulink&gt;], also needs to be evaluated further.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Some hints of anticancer activity have been observed in the phase I clinical development of other Aurora kinase inhibitors, such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="53081"&gt;danusertib&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="57452"&gt;alisertib&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="53058"&gt;AT-9283&lt;/ulink&gt;, and the effects are under examination in ongoing phase II trials to attain proof of concept [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163727"&gt;1163727&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The key will be to define the appropriate patient population, either empirically or by identifying predictive biomarkers. One way to achieve this aim is to screen for an interaction between synthetic lethal or sensibilizing genes that have a therapeutic potential worth testing in future clinical trials. This was the approach taken with the pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="51297"&gt;tozasertib&lt;/ulink&gt;, which selectively kills cells that overexpress Myc, where the synthetic lethal interaction was attributed to Aurora B kinase inhibition [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163745"&gt;1163745&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In another example of this approach, a synthetic lethal screen that was used to target proteins connected to an EGFR network of proteins determined that Aurora A kinase inhibitors synergized with EGFR antagonists to reduce cell viability and tumor size [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163748"&gt;1163748&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Whether the anticancer activity of ENMD-2076 as a single agent is sufficient to justify further development needs to be clinically proven. The probability of success for ENMD-2076 in the cancer setting will likely increase if it is used in combination with another anticancer agent, but an appropriate combination still needs to be identified. Hence, another key factor will be to identify combinations with enhanced efficacy without worsening the safety profile observed with the single compound.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Competition with ENMD-2076 is wide, although not beyond phase II clinical development, and emerges not only from other Aurora kinase inhibitors, of which some also exhibit overlapping cross-reactivity profiles, but also from other mitotic small-molecule inhibitors, such as inhibitors of Polo-like kinase or Cyclin-dependent kinases, or even more specific angiogenesis inhibitors [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163750"&gt;1163750&lt;/ulink&gt;]. None of the antimitotic small molecule inhibitors have currently demonstrated sufficiently convincing proof of concept in the clinic [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1163727"&gt;1163727&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A success story for any of the compounds under clinical evaluation, including ENMD-2076, would not only reactivate the interest in mitotic inhibitors but, most importantly, provide patients with new treatment options.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="21794">CASI Pharmaceuticals Inc</Company><Country id="CN">China</Country><DevelopmentStatus
