"<AdverseEvents><para>Results were published in 2013. There were no cases of vasogenic oedema during the treatment and there were occurance of gout and  transient ischaemic reported during the treatment with <ulink linkType=""Drug"" linkID=""57403"">GSK-933776A</ulink>,  but these were not related to the drug treatment. There were no clinically significant changes in the electrocardiogram, vital signs or clinical laboratory and magnetic resonance imaging findings were reported during the treatment period. One subject receing placebo reported to have a novel microbleed. There was occurance of  novel anti-GSK-933776 antibodies reported in two subjects one of which was neutralising with antibody titre up to 80 and there was no increae in the titers during the treatment period. There was no statistically significant reports of the neuropsychological tests. The commonly observed adverse events at diffrent doses were  fatigue, nasopharyngitis,  nausea, vomiting,  dizziness, confusional state, diarrhea, hematoma and increase in the  blood creatine phosphokinase [<ulink linkType=""Reference"" linkID=""1511226"">1511226</ulink>].</para></AdverseEvents>","<ProtocolDescription><para>Part A would be a single-blind, single-dose, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in up to five consecutive cohorts of Alzheimers Disease subjects. Each subject  would receive a single infusion of <ulink linkType=""Drug"" linkID=""57403"">GSK-933776</ulink> or placebo. The dose for the first cohort would be 0.001 mg/kg. The proposed nominal doses for subsequent cohorts are 0.01, 0.1, 0.5 and 3 mg/kg, but these might be altered based on the outcome of the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data of the preceding group(s). The maximum possible dose would be 20 mg/kg, although the planned top dose is 18 mg/kg.</para><para>Part B would be a single-blind, repeat-dose, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation design. It was proposed that there would be initially three cohorts of AD subjects. However up to five cohorts might be recruited if required in order to characterise <ulink linkType=""Drug"" linkID=""57403"">GSK-933776</ulink> fully. Each cohort would consist of eight subjects (six active, two placebo) who would each receive a maximum of three infusions of <ulink linkType=""Drug"" linkID=""57403"">GSK-933776</ulink> or placebo. </para><para>Dosing in Part B would  proceed in parallel with Part A following satisfactory review of minimum data sets as below:<br/>First cohort in Part B: at least 3 weeks' data from the Part A dose that was the same dose level as that planned for Part B. <br/>Second cohort in Part B: at least 3 weeks pharmacokinetic (PK) data and 8 weeks safety data following the first dose from all the subjects on active treatment in the preceding Part B cohort plus a satisfactory outcome of the PIB. <br/>Subsequent cohorts in Part B: at least 3 weeks PK data and 8 weeks safety data follow.</para></ProtocolDescription>",Phase 1/Phase 2 Clinical,C12,GSK-933776A,Alzheimers disease,"<Outcomes><para>Results were published in 2013. In plasma: the clearance of the population and the volume of distribution of the central compartment at the doses >/= 1 mg/kg was found to be 0.132 ml/h/kg and 40.7 ml/kg  respectively, whereas at  0.1 mg/kg they were found to be approximately 0.272 ml/h/kg and 72.8 ml/kg  respectively. The half-life of the terminal phase ranged from 10 to 15 days. In the part B of the study the volume of distribution at steady-state (Vdss) was found to be 103.63 ml/kg at 0.1 mg/kg , 59.96, 60.92 and 45.72 ml/kg at 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively. After the first administration of the <ulink linkType=""Drug"" linkID=""57403"">GSK-933776</ulink> there was a total increase in the Abeta levels and decrease in the free Abeta levels reported which was dose dependent and there was a significant change after  administration of 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg doses. The peak : trough ratios of the Abeta 1 to 42 and 1 to 34 were &lt;/= 2 at doses 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively. There was no effect of placebo reported on the Abeta levels. In cerebrospinal fluid:The subjects receiving <ulink linkType=""Drug"" linkID=""57403"">GSK-933776</ulink> ie, two at 1 mg/kg, five at 3 mg/kg and five at 6mg/kg reported detectable concentrations at day 78. The ratios of the mean of the CSF versus plasma concentration at day 78 were 0.217% at 6 mg/kg observed in four subjects and 0.272% at 3 mg/kg observed in five subjects. After the administration of the 6 mg/kg dose of <ulink linkType=""Drug"" linkID=""57403"">GSK-933776</ulink> the Abeta 1 to 38 was increased and there was also increase in the Abeta levels reported after receiving placebo. There were no changes in the APOE, tau or P-tau during the treatment with <ulink linkType=""Drug"" linkID=""57403"">GSK-933776</ulink> or placebo. There were six subjects from the single dose who re-entered the repeated dose. The APOE epsilon4 carrier frequency was similar in all the subjetcs and there were nine subjects with twocopies of the APOE epsilon4 allele [<ulink linkType=""Reference"" linkID=""1511226"">1511226</ulink>]</para><para>In May 2016, results were presented. GSK-933776 blocked beta amyloiod mimics (BAMs) and inhibited complement factor-1 (CF-1) bioactivity dose dependently with an EC50 of 20 microg/ml. In plasma samples from Alzheimer's patients, GSK-933776 treatment resulted in an increase of 10 and 27% in CF-1 bioactivity. Estimated time to steady state was 6 h, however, after three doses of GSK-933776, the levels of total BAM were not at steady state [<ulink linkType=""Reference"" linkID=""1752067"">1752067</ulink>].</para></Outcomes>",A Clinical Study to Assess Single and Repeat Doses of a New Medication (GSK-933776) in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease,106006; 2006-004014-41; BA1106006; NCT00459550,"<Regimens><para>Subjects would be randomized into two parts of the study:<br/>Part A: subjects of the three single-dose (SD) cohorts were dosed with <ulink linkType=""Drug"" linkID=""57403"">GSK-933776</ulink> (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg), the dosing in new cohort began only q3w.
