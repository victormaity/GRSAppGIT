There would be two treatment groups: one group taking 400 microg per day of folic acid as part of a prenatal supplement, beginning at study enrollment (&amp;lt; 10 weeks gestational age) and a second group taking 800 microg per day of folic acid as part of the prenatal supplement. Both groups would be provided identical composition of prenatal supplements other than folic acid content. Repeated measures of outcome variables would be determined in blood samples collected at various times during pregnancy and at delivery. Due to the role of prenatal supplementation in helping maintain optimal nutrition status throughout pregnancy, there would be no placebo control.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Women would be recruited through the Athens Regional Medical Center Midwifery Practice and all blood draws associated with this study would be conducted during scheduled prenatal visits. The research protocol would be consistent with the standard of care provided by the clinic and would not affect the prenatal services provided to the  women. Following consent at the first prenatal visit, women would be randomly assigned to receive prenatal supplements containing either 400 or 800 microg of folic acid (all other ingredients at unmodified concentrations). The 400 microg dose approximates the current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for pregnant women of 600 microg dietary folate equivalents (400 microg folic acid =  600 microg DFEs; conversion factor based on higher bioavailability of folic acid would be: 1 microg folic acid = 1.7 microg DFE). The higher dose of 800 microg folic acid represents an amount commonly found in over-the-counter prenatal supplements. Women would be asked to take the supplements daily throughout the duration of gestation and to follow their standard prenatal diet, with the exception of avoiding highly fortified (&gt; 100% RDA) ready-to-eat cereals and fortified energy/snack bars and drinks, due to their high folic acid content.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At the first visit, the women would be instructed in the use of a dietary recall data collection sheet (food diary) which they would be asked to complete during specific time points during the study. Each set of dietary recalls would include information for three 24 h periods on non-consecutive days including one weekend day. Dietary recall information would be obtained at approximately weeks 16 and 32 of gestation. This would permit assessment of typical dietary intake of total calories and specific nutrients, including folate.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Blood samples would be collected, in the non-fasting state, at the first, 28  and 36 weeks prenatal visits and from the mother and cord blood at delivery for determination of primary outcome measures.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/ProtocolDescription&gt;</ProtocolDescription></ProtocolAndOutcomes><AdverseEventsByInterventions></AdverseEventsByInterventions><DoseRouteByInterventions></DoseRouteByInterventions><SitesByCountries><SitesByCountry
