In September 2012, positive results from the phase II trial were published and a second trial was underway  [&lt;ulink linkID="1325830" linkType="Reference"&gt;1325830&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2015, another phase I/II trial was initiated   [&lt;ulink linkID="2071013" linkType="Reference"&gt;2071013&lt;/ulink&gt;].   In December 2018, an IND filing was accepted by the US FDA for the treatment of progeria and progeroid laminopathies.

By February 2010, phase II trials in progeria had begun  [&lt;ulink linkID="1078541" linkType="Reference"&gt;1078541&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This indication was still listed as  in phase II in July 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1215606" linkType="Reference"&gt;1215606&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, in November 2011, the drug was no longer listed on Merck's pipeline [&lt;ulink linkID="1238309" linkType="Reference"&gt;1238309&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The compound was previously under development by Schering-Plough for the potential treatment of various cancers, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [&lt;ulink linkID="279661" linkType="reference"&gt;279661&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By November 2005, a phase III trial in MDS had been initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="631860" linkType="Reference"&gt;631860&lt;/ulink&gt;]; this trial was ongoing in May 2008 but had been terminated by October 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="920822" linkType="Reference"&gt;920822&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2005, phase II studies had been initiated in a variety of difficult-to-treat cancers including leukemia, pancreas tumor and urinary tract cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="631860" linkType="Reference"&gt;631860&lt;/ulink&gt;];  phase II trials in solid tumors were ongoing in February 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="908364" linkType="Reference"&gt;908364&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, the drug was no longer listed for these indications on Schering-Plough's pipeline in June 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="919911" linkType="Reference"&gt;919911&lt;/ulink&gt;], and it is assumed that development  had been discontinued by that time. Phase III trials of lonafarnib had also previously been initiated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [&lt;ulink linkID="483388" linkType="reference"&gt;483388&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="488149" linkType="reference"&gt;488149&lt;/ulink&gt;]; these were ongoing in November 2003, at which time it was predicted that launch would take place by 2007 [&lt;ulink linkID="513822" linkType="reference"&gt;513822&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="513799" linkType="reference"&gt;513799&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in February 2004, Schering-Plough stopped enrollment in the trials after interim data suggested insufficient evidence of efficacy [&lt;ulink linkID="521333" linkType="reference"&gt;521333&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2005, phase II studies had been initiated in breast cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="631860" linkType="Reference"&gt;631860&lt;/ulink&gt;]; a further phase II trial in metastatic breast cancer began in October 2008, however the trial had been terminated by April 2011  [&lt;ulink linkID="1120120" linkType="Reference"&gt;1120120&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By October 2010, progeria was the only indication listed as in development for lonafarnib on Merck's pipeline [&lt;ulink linkID="1146920" linkType="Reference"&gt;1146920&lt;/ulink&gt;]; this was still the case in July 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1215606" linkType="Reference"&gt;1215606&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2018, expanded access program was to be launched later that year [&lt;ulink linkID="2062245" linkType="Reference"&gt;2062245&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2018, the FDA had granted  Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and progeroid laminopathies [&lt;ulink linkID="2105488" linkType="Reference"&gt;2105488&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2018, a NDA filling was planned to be submitted in 2019 for the treatment of progeria and progeroid laminopathies [&lt;ulink linkID="2100671" linkType="Reference"&gt;2100671&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2069118" linkType="Reference"&gt;2069118&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2018, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) designation to lonafarnib in the treatment of both HGPS and progeroid laminopathies [&lt;ulink linkID="2085768" linkType="Reference"&gt;2085768&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2011, the PRF was awarded Orphan status for the drug  [&lt;ulink linkID="1261237" linkType="Reference"&gt;1261237&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2019, a MAA filling was planned to submit in 2019 for the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and progeroid laminopathies [&lt;ulink linkID="2129875" linkType="Reference"&gt;2129875&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2018, the COMP of the EMA recommended granting lonafarnib Orphan designation for treatment of HGPS [&lt;ulink linkID="2100439" linkType="Reference"&gt;2100439&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in December 2018, the Orphan designation was granted [&lt;ulink linkID="2115286" linkType="Reference"&gt;2115286&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2018, the company anticipated the scientific advice from European Medicines Agency by the end of 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="2069118" linkType="Reference"&gt;2069118&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Regulatory&gt;</value></Regulatory><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Progeria&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In September 2018, Eiger received minutes from a pre-investigational new drug (pre-IND) meeting with the Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products of the US FDA for lonafarnib in the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome [&lt;ulink linkID="2069118" linkType="Reference"&gt;2069118&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2018, an IND application was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of the treatment of both Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS or progeria) and progeroid laminopathies  [&lt;ulink linkID="2100671" linkType="Reference"&gt;2100671&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2015, an open label, single group assigned, phase I/II study (&lt;ulink linkID="243427" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02579044&lt;/ulink&gt;; P00017505) was initiated in the US to assess the combination  of lonafarnib with &lt;ulink linkID="13340" linkType="Drug"&gt;everolimus&lt;/ulink&gt;, when administered at its MTD in patients (expected n = 80) with hutchinson-gillford progeria syndrome. At that time, the trial was expected to complete in December 2021 [&lt;ulink linkID="2071013" linkType="Reference"&gt;2071013&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2009, an open label, single group assigned, global, phase II study (&lt;ulink linkID="57692" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00916747&lt;/ulink&gt;; Progeria Efficacy) in patients with Patients (n = 85) With hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome(HGPS) and progeroid laminopathies was initiated in the US. The primary endpoint was to evaluate therapeutic effect of &lt;ulink linkID="2765" linkType="Drug"&gt;zoledronic acid&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkID="4155" linkType="Drug"&gt;pravastatin&lt;/ulink&gt; and lonafarnib [&lt;ulink linkID="2027771" linkType="Reference"&gt;2027771&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2018, data from the trial were published. Data from 27 children with Progeria received oral lonafarnib (150 mg/m2) twice daily as a monotherapy demonstrated that treatment with lonafarnib alone compared with no treatment was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate (3.7% vs. 33.3%) after a median of 2.2 years of follow up [&lt;ulink linkID="2027772" linkType="Reference"&gt;2027772&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2027194" linkType="Reference"&gt;2027194&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By January 2007 a phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="39342" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00425607&lt;/ulink&gt;) in progeria was listed [&lt;ulink linkID="1326025" linkType="Reference"&gt;1326025&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2010, phase II trials in progeria had begun  [&lt;ulink linkID="1078541" linkType="Reference"&gt;1078541&lt;/ulink&gt;]; these were ongoing in July 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1215606" linkType="Reference"&gt;1215606&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2012, results were published. The 2.5-year trial enrolled 28 patients from 16 countries, and included 75% of currently known progeria patients worldwide. Patients received oral lonafarnib twice daily. Significant improvements were observed in weight gain, bone structure and the cardiovascular system. Arterial stiffness was decreased by 35%. At that time,  a second clinical trial, funded by the NIH and PRF, was  underway, with more trials  expected to follow [&lt;ulink linkID="1325830" linkType="Reference"&gt;1325830&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1326030" linkType="Reference"&gt;1326030&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Hematological malignancies&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;By November 2003, a phase III trial was planned for MDS [&lt;ulink linkID="513822" linkType="reference"&gt;513822&lt;/ulink&gt;]; the trial  (&lt;ulink linkID="23676" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00109538&lt;/ulink&gt;;  P02978AM3) was initiated in May 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="631860" linkType="Reference"&gt;631860&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="920822" linkType="Reference"&gt;920822&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal study was to test 200 mg lonafarnib given twice daily continuously (or until unacceptable toxicity or transformation to AML, or disease progression, or other discontinuation criteria) in patients (expected n = 200) with MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The primary endpoint would be the proportion of subjects who achieved platelet transfusion independence for any 8-consecutive week period after randomization without worsening of red blood cell transfusion requirements or hemoglobin. Recruitment was ongoing in May 2008, at which time, the trial was expected to be completed in January 2012; however, by October 2008, the trial had been terminated [&lt;ulink linkID="920822" linkType="Reference"&gt;920822&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2003, clinical data on lonafarnib were presented at the 45th ASH meeting in San Diego, CA, from a phase I/II study involving 67 patients with either advanced MDS (RAEB, RAEB-t; n = 32) or CMML (n = 35) who were treated with lonafarnib at doses of 200 to 300 mg po bid until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity was observed. Of the 49 patients who had bone marrow cytogenetics available, 24 had low or int-1 IPSS scores and 25 had int-2 or high. Prior therapy included hematopoietic growth factors (13%) and cytotoxic chemotherapy (18%). ECOG performance status was 0 or 1 in 89% of patients. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities observed were diarrhea (26%), fatigue (17%), anorexia (12%), and nausea (9%). Despite therapy with antidiarrheals and antiemetics, 17 (26%) discontinued therapy due to adverse events (6/17 due to diarrhea after 4-26 weeks of treatment). DLTs were seen in the 300-mg bid cohort; the MTD was 200 mg bid. Overall 12 of 42 evaluable patients responded (4/17 MDS, 8/25 CMML). Two patients (1 MDS, 1 CMML) achieved a complete remission. Hematological improvement was observed in 10 additional patients (3 MDS, 7 CMML). In these 10, there were five major platelet responses, four major and five minor erythroid responses and one major neutrophil response. Of the 23 patients who were red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent at study entry, four (three MDS, one CMML) achieved RBC transfusion-independence (duration of response 12 to 32+ weeks) and four (one MDS, three CMML) achieved at least a 50% decrease in RBC transfusion requirements (duration of response 8 to 29 weeks). Of the 22 patients who were platelet transfusion-dependent and/or had platelet counts &amp;lt; 30K at baseline, four achieved platelet transfusion independence and one showed an absolute increase above baseline of &amp;gt; 30K in platelet count (response duration 14 to 66 weeks). Of the 37 patients who had bone marrow (BM) blasts &amp;gt; 5% at baseline, 16 showed a &amp;gt;/= 50% reduction in BM blasts [&lt;ulink linkID="515887" linkType="reference"&gt;515887&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were presented in February 2004 at the New Targets and Innovative Strategies in Cancer Treatment: One Year of Progress [&lt;ulink linkID="524997" linkType="reference"&gt;524997&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Phase II trials of lonafarnib in leukemia patients, presumably including those with MDS, had been initiated by November 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="513822" linkType="reference"&gt;513822&lt;/ulink&gt;]; these were ongoing  in November 2004  [&lt;ulink linkID="575533" linkType="Reference"&gt;575533&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2002, interim results from an ongoing safety and efficacy phase II trial of lonafarnib (at the phase I recommended dose of 200 mg bid) were presented at the 44th ASH meeting in Philadelphia, PA. A total of 86 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 54 were evaluable for hematological responses at that time [&lt;ulink linkID="473985" linkType="reference"&gt;473985&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="473238" linkType="reference"&gt;473238&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="474036" linkType="reference"&gt;474036&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Phase I published data on lonafarnib with advanced hematologic malignancies were presented at the same meeting. Patents (n = 19, of which 17 were evaluable) were enrolled into three cohorts; cohort 1 was 200 mg po bid lonafarnib continually as a single agent, cohort 2 increased the dose to 300 mg, and cohort 3 was 400 mg; grade 3 dose-limiting toxicities were experienced at the highest dose level [&lt;ulink linkID="473985" linkType="reference"&gt;473985&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="474035" linkType="reference"&gt;474035&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;Combination data from a phase I study of &lt;ulink linkID="11460" linkType="Drug"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; and lonafarnib in patients with CML and failure on imatinib were also presented at ASH 2003. Starting dose level for the chronic phase cohort was imatinib 400 mg daily + lonafarnib 100 mg bid, while the accelerated and blast phase cohort received imatinib 600 mg daily and lonafarnib 100 mg bid. Subsequent cohorts escalated the dose of lonafarnib by 25 mg/dose with no change in imatinib until a dose of 200 mg bid of lonafarnib was reached. At the time of presentation, 10 patients had been treated: 4 chronic phase, 4 accelerated phase, 2 blast phase. Median age was 61 years, and prior therapy included imatinib (n = 10), IFN-based therapy (n = 8), and other agents (n = 4). Patients received therapy for a median of 6 weeks (3 to 24+). Among those in chronic phase, 1 patient (imatinib 400 mg, lonafarnib 125 mg) had G3 diarrhea. One additional patient had G3 hypokalemia after 3 cycles. Among accelerated/blast phase patients there was no G3 toxicity in dose level 1 (imatinib 600 mg, lonafarnib 100 mg) and 1 patient in dose level 2 (imatinib 600 mg, lonafarnib 125 mg) had G3 diarrhea and vomiting that resolved with adequate therapy and did not recur after dose reduction (lonafarnib 100 mg). Interim PK analyses for imatinib and lonafarnib showed no apparent increases in the exposure to both imatinib and lonafarnib when co-administered. Among three evaluable patients in chronic phase, 1 achieved CHR (duration 4 months+); 1 of 4 in accelerated phase achieved PHR (duration 8 weeks); both patients in blast phase had a significant but transient decrease in peripheral absolute blasts (2.02 to .15 x10(9)/L, and 11.6 to .22 x10(9)/L). No MTD was reached [&lt;ulink linkID="516748" linkType="reference"&gt;516748&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Updated data from this study were presented in December 2004 at the 46th ASH meeting in San Diego, CA. At that time, 22 patients had been treated. Pharmacokinetic data from 12 patients suggested no apparent increase in exposure or changes in PK when lonafarnib and imatinib were coadministered [&lt;ulink linkID="572165" linkType="Reference"&gt;572165&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Breast cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2011, clinical data were presented at the 47th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL. In the phase II, multi-institutional, open-label, non randomized study (&lt;ulink linkID="50248" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00773474&lt;/ulink&gt;; OG BRE07-126) patients (n = 29) with locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer were   treated with lonafarnib 200 mg to  400 mg po daily. After treatment, diarrhea and dehydration (grade 3/4) were observed in 23% and 8%  of patients, respectively. Grade 5 toxicities such as encephalopathy and disease progression  were  seen in 4% of patients.   The researchers concluded that results based on 20 patients  did not improve PFS or ORR, compared to controls [&lt;ulink linkID="1194099" linkType="Reference"&gt;1194099&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="50248" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00773474&lt;/ulink&gt;) in metastatic breast cancer began in October 2008, to determine the rate of progression-free survival of patients receiving lonafarnib monotherapy. At that time, the trial was expected to enroll 43 patients and complete in June 2010.

The trial, BRE012, was a randomized double-blind study of anastrozole  plus lonafarnib or placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="680733" linkType="Reference"&gt;680733&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;By September 2003, &lt;ulink linkID="23119" linkType="Company"&gt;EORTC&lt;/ulink&gt; was conducting a phase I study of lonafarnib in combination with paclitaxel and &lt;ulink linkID="6386" linkType="Drug"&gt;trastuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt;  in patients with breast cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="504360" linkType="reference"&gt;504360&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Studies from this trial were reported in October 2007 at the 19th AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference in San Francisco, CA. 23 patients received 185 cycles of treatment with a median duration of 6 cycles;  6 patients remained on treatment at that time. The trial was interrupted before reaching the MTD upon the sponsor's request. At that time, 19 patients went off protocol, 10 due to toxicity, 2 upon patient's request, 3 upon investigator decision and 4 for progressive disease. The adverse events for which patients went off protocol were: neutropenia (6), neuropathy (2), allergic reaction (1) and ischemia and increase QTc (1). At the highest dose level (lonafarnib 300 mg/d), one out of eight patients experienced DLT of grade 3 allergic reaction. The related toxicity profile was fatigue, sensory neuropathy, myalgia, diarrhea, nausea, arthralgia, skin rash, G4 neutropenia, G2 anemia, abdominal pain, vomiting, stomatitis and anorexia. Radiological responses were documented in 10  of 18 patients assessable (1 complete response, 9 partial responses), with an additional 6 patients experiencing stable disease. At that time, with a median follow-up of 6.5 months, the progression free survival at 6 months was 85% [&lt;ulink linkID="844678" linkType="Reference"&gt;844678&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2005, clinical data on  lonafarnib were presented at the 41st ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. In a phase II trial, 15 patients with HNSCC (median age = 57 years; age range = 31 to 65 years) received oral lonafarnib (200 mg bid) for 4 weeks  (1 treatment cycle). Treatment duration was a median of 2 cycles (range = 0 to 8 cycles). Seven patients had stable disease (SD) over &amp;gt;= 3 cycles; one patient had SD over 8 treatment cycles. Median overall and progression-free survival were 8.5 and 2 months, respectively. Lonafarnib was well-tolerated with no grade 3/4 hematologic adverse effects (AEs). Grade 4 hyperuricemia was seen in one patient, while another had grade 3 anemia, QT elongation, infection, cardiac ischemia and syncope. Pharmacodynamic assessments for treatment-associated HDJ-2 farnesylation inhibition were ongoing at that time [&lt;ulink linkID="603542" linkType="Reference"&gt;603542&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In November 2003, phase I studies were  ongoing in head and neck cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="513822" linkType="reference"&gt;513822&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="504360" linkType="reference"&gt;504360&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2001, data from a phase I trial of lonafarnib were presented at the 37th ASCO meeting in San Francisco, CA. In this trial, 28 patients with head and neck cancer (21 had oral cavity lesions and 19 had stage IV disease) received 100, 200 or 300 mg bid for 1 to 2 weeks prior to surgery. Four of 21 evaluable patients had clinical responses [&lt;ulink linkID="408759" linkType="reference"&gt;408759&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="409890" linkType="reference"&gt;409890&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2007, preclinical data presented at the 98th AACR meeting in Los Angeles, CA, suggested that lonafarnib stimulates the IGF-1R/Akt signaling pathway and thereby inducing survivin expression and resistance to the drug in HNSCC cells [&lt;ulink linkID="783113" linkType="Reference"&gt;783113&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Carcinoma of the urothelial tract&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2003, phase II clinical data on lonafarnib were presented at the 39th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL. Patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial tract tumors (n = 34) received lonafarnib orally at doses of either 100 or 150 mg po bid, and &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; (1000 mg/m2) as a 30-min infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days [&lt;ulink linkID="491527" linkType="reference"&gt;491527&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2001, data on lonafarnib were presented at the 37th ASCO meeting in San Francisco, CA. Results from this phase II trial, which treated 19 urothelial tract carcinoma patients with 200 mg lonafarnib po bid four times in 28 days, showed no evidence of antitumor activity [&lt;ulink linkID="408963" linkType="reference"&gt;408963&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="410458" linkType="reference"&gt;410458&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metastatic pancreatic cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2001, data on lonafarnib were presented at the 37th ASCO meeting in San Francisco, CA. The phase II study compared lonafarnib (200 mg po bid for 28 consecutive days) with gemcitabine in 53 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Lonafarnib and gemcitabine appeared to have comparable activity; at that time, the combination was being pursued in newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="410384" linkType="reference"&gt;410384&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;NSCLC&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2003, phase III trials of lonafarnib in NSCLC in combination with taxanes were underway [&lt;ulink linkID="483388" linkType="reference"&gt;483388&lt;/ulink&gt;]; these were ongoing in November 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="513822" linkType="reference"&gt;513822&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="515375" linkType="reference"&gt;515375&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in February 2004, Schering-Plough stopped enrollment in the trials after an analysis of interim data led to the conclusion that the studies would not provide sufficient evidence of efficacy to warrant further enrollment [&lt;ulink linkID="521333" linkType="reference"&gt;521333&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In April 2002, phase I/II data on lonafarnib with paclitaxel were presented at the 93rd AACR meeting in San Francisco, CA.

The phase I/II trial evaluated lonafarnib in combination with paclitaxel, in patients with solid tumors; the schedule was lonafarnib 100 mg orally bid and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 iv given every 3 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="404627" linkType="reference"&gt;404627&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="501329" linkType="reference"&gt;501329&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2006, phase I data from a trial involving patients with recurrent glioblastoma were presented at the 42nd ASCO meeting in Atlanta, GA. The 15 patients accrued were given lonafarnib (100, 150, or 200 mg bid), in combination with &lt;ulink linkID="4529" linkType="Drug"&gt;temozolomide&lt;/ulink&gt; (150 mg/m2 dose). Partial responses were seen in four patients and three patients showed stable disease. No DLTs were seen, but severe adverse events, including grade 3/4  leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, were observed. It was not certain whether the efficacy was due to temozolomide or the  combination. At that time, studies were planned to evaluate potential predictors of response (ie MGMT gene promoter methylation), and to obtain pharmacokinetic and additional efficacy data [&lt;ulink linkID="669079" linkType="Reference"&gt;669079&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2004, clinical data assessing DLT, MTD, biologic and pharmacokinetic  behavior of the combination of lonafarnib, cisplatin and gemcitabine were presented at the 16th EORTC-NCI-AACR meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. At this time, 21 patients had received 40 cycles of lonafarnib (75-125 mg bid daily), cisplatin (75-100 mg/m2 iv day 1) and gemcitabine (75 -1000 mg/m2 iv, weekly  days 1, 8 or 1, 8 and 15) every 3 to 4 weeks. The trial was amended to investigate every 3 week schedule and delay lonafarnib administration until day 8 of course 1, to assess the emetogenic affects.  DLT was experienced by 3 of 9 patients on  75 mg bid/75 mg/m2/1000 mg/m2, respectively. The main toxicities were thrombocytopenia (grade 3 to 4), nausea (grade 2 to 3), fatigue/asthenia, diarrhea (grade 2) and transaminitis and tinnitus (grade 1).  Previously treated breast cancer patients (n = 2) had confirmed clinical response. One clinical response lasted for 7 cycles and a partial response was ongoing after 8 cycles. Accrual was ongoing at that  time [&lt;ulink linkID="562018" linkType="Reference"&gt;562018&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2004, phase I data on lonafarnib were presented at the 40th ASCO meeting in New Orleans, LA. The dose escalation study recruited 48 children with various forms of CNS tumors who were administered twice-daily doses of lonafarnib (70, 90, 115, 150, 200 and 260 mg/m2) until the DLT was reached. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated slow absorption and elimination of the compound following oral dosing with food, and fluctuations in plasma concentration were minimal. Out of 30 evaluable patients, 1 achieved a partial response and 11 had stable disease for between 2 and 12 months. Lonafarnib was well tolerated with an MTD of 150 mg/m2 (DLT = 200 mg/m2).

Lonafarnib, when administered in combination with bortezomib to myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells, resulted in rapid caspase activation and down regulation of p-AKT. Bortezomib (8 nM) or lonafarnib (5 microM) administered separately resulted in 20% and 10% apoptosis, respectively, compared with 88% apoptosis when both agents were given simultaneously. At that time, further studies using this combination were planned [&lt;ulink linkID="573784" linkType="Reference"&gt;573784&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2004, it was reported at the Drug Discovery Technology meeting in Boston, MA, that lonafarnib has an inhibition constant for farnesyl protein transferase of 360 pM and, in monkeys, a bioavailability of 68% and half-life of 4.4 h [&lt;ulink linkID="556659" linkType="Reference"&gt;556659&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2004, preclinical data on lonafarnib were presented at the 95th AACR meeting in Orlando, FL. Lonafarnib  inhibited angiogenesis and invasion in an squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) cell line via induction of IGFBP-3, which contributed to antitumor activities of lonafarnib in HNSCC [&lt;ulink linkID="530213" linkType="reference"&gt;530213&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data suggested that lonafarnib enhanced the growth inhibitory effect of &lt;ulink linkID="2953" linkType="Drug"&gt;docetaxel&lt;/ulink&gt; in breast cancer cells that are sensitive to lonafarnib as a single agent [&lt;ulink linkID="533827" linkType="reference"&gt;533827&lt;/ulink&gt;].

The compound inhibited growth of NSCLC cell lines with IC50 values of 2.1 to 9.8 microM and 0.14 to 3.12 microM, for 3- and 5-day studies, respectively. Lonafarnib, 10 microM, induced apparent apoptosis in 3 of 10 cell lines and G1 or G2/M arrest in 7 of 10. p-AKT was increased by the compound and is therefore not a target for growth arrest or apoptosis in human NSCLC cells [&lt;ulink linkID="513754" linkType="reference"&gt;513754&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, preclinical data on lonafarnib in combination with fenretinide in ten HNSCC cell lines were presented at the 94th AACR meeting, Washington, DC. The study demonstrated apoptotic activity and caspase activation [&lt;ulink linkID="484376" linkType="reference"&gt;484376&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further preclinical data presented at AACR 2003 showed synergistic antiproliferative effects of adenovirus expressing IGFBP-3 (Ad5CMV-BP3) and lonafarnib, and reduction in NSCLC xenograft tumor growth by induction of apoptosis [&lt;ulink linkID="499109" linkType="reference"&gt;499109&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2003, preclinical data on lonafarnib were presented at the 225th ACS meeting in New Orleans, LA. Lonafarnib displayed an IC50 value of 27 nM for the FT receptor and an EC50 value of 10,000 nM for the induction of apoptosis [&lt;ulink linkID="483107" linkType="reference"&gt;483107&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2002, preclinical data on the additive or synergistic effects of lonafarnib in combination with imatinib  were presented at the 93rd AACR meeting in San Francisco, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="447194" linkType="reference"&gt;447194&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Lonafarnib also suppressed the growth of HNSCC cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner [&lt;ulink linkID="447037" linkType="reference"&gt;447037&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Another study showed that lonafarnib inhibits Ras activity [&lt;ulink linkID="447643" linkType="reference"&gt;447643&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2001, preclinical data on the synergistic effects of lonafarnib with imatinib, in imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl leukemia cells, were presented at the 43rd ASH meeting in Orlando, FL [&lt;ulink linkID="432578" linkType="reference"&gt;432578&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="432852" linkType="reference"&gt;432852&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2001, data presented at the 92nd AACR meeting in New Orleans, LA demonstrated that lonafarnib is a potent inhibitor of MDR1product p-glycoprotein [&lt;ulink linkID="404862" linkType="reference"&gt;404862&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data showed that lonafarnib inhibition of VEGF, IL-8 and angiogenin in tumor models [&lt;ulink linkID="404627" linkType="reference"&gt;404627&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2000, preclinical studies with lonafarnib in five established glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines, and GBM tumor xenograft models, were presented at the 91st AACR meeting in San Francisco, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="362468" linkType="reference"&gt;362468&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="364521" linkType="reference"&gt;364521&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="364268" linkType="reference"&gt;364268&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 1998, in vivo studies showed the efficacy of lonafarnib in several early-stage K-ras and H-ras tumor models [&lt;ulink linkID="289610" linkType="reference"&gt;289610&lt;/ulink&gt;].

One of the most active compounds, Sch-704742, had an IC50 of 0.6 nM in a FPT assay. This compound had a half life of 2.3 h and a bioavailability of 43% when dosed to rats at 10 mg/kg. The survival rate of female nu/nu mice, injected with EJ human bladder cancer cells before administration of 40 mg/kg of this compound, was 9 out of 10 [&lt;ulink linkID="687439" linkType="Reference"&gt;687439&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By July 2004, a series of lonafarnib analogs had been synthesized. The most potent compound exhibited   IC50 values of 0.32 nM and 0.03 microM in the FTase and soft agar cellular assay respectively, and had an oral stability in rat with AUC of 15.5 microg h/ml [&lt;ulink linkID="643954" linkType="Reference"&gt;643954&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="643953" linkType="Reference"&gt;643953&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2001, data on lonafarnib analogs were presented at the 222nd ACS meeting in Chicago, IL. Lonafarnib and Sch-226374 analogs displayed improved cellular potency and pharmacokinetic profile in the monkey.

Several studies, mainly focused on hematologic malignancies, pancreatic, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), have evaluated the prognostic importance of ras mutation in human tumors. Conflicting results have been reported [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="325833"&gt;325833&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="488771"&gt;488771&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Ras protein is normally synthesized as ProRas, which undergoes a number of post-translational modifications, the first and most important of which is farnesylation, which renders Ras protein more hydrophobic and thus better capable of linking to the inner surface of the plasma membrane [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="389034"&gt;389034&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Farnesyl transferase (FT), the enzyme which catalyzes this reaction, is the target of several drugs that are under clinical development; eg, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7342"&gt;BMS-214662&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15065"&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co&lt;/ulink&gt;) and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17113"&gt;tipifarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; (R-115777, Zarnestra; &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17413"&gt;Janssen Pharmaceutica BV&lt;/ulink&gt;). These are nonpeptidomimetic FT inhibitors, which have displayed activity during in vitro tests of human tumor cell lines, whereas the earlier peptidomimetic FT inhibitors, although potent, had limited activity against tumor cells in culture or in animals, generally loosing two or three logs of potency in whole cells [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="389034"&gt;389034&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Processed Ras proteins localize to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, and function as a molecular switch that cycles between an inactive, guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP)-bound form, and an active, guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-bound form. When in its active form, either because of the binding of an external ligand, or because of its constitutive activation, Ras activates several downstream effectors, such as Raf-1, Rac, Rho, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which mediate important cellular functions, the most important of which are proliferation, and cytoskeletal organization [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="488772"&gt;488772&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Although FT inhibitors were initially developed as a strategy to disrupt the activity of Ras proteins, data is accumulating to suggest that the effect on other farnesylated proteins may be even more important. In particular, FT inhibitors may act by altering the activity of Rho proteins which control cell shape, adhesion, and motility. In particular, changes in the ubiquitous RhoB protein seem to be central to the growth-inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of FT inhibitors. Rho may drive a different range of cancers from Ras; if FT inhibitors mediate their effects primarily through changes in Rho, then enrolment for phase II trials could be affected, with a greater focus on tumors that are considered to be primarily Rho driven, such as melanoma and breast cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="502401"&gt;502401&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;The synthesis and SAR of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; is described in the previous evaluation of this drug written by P Norman [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="494486"&gt;494486&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Briefly, the structure is based on a benzocycloheptapyridine nucleus. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;Lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; was a significant improvement on an earlier compound &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15000"&gt;Sch-44342&lt;/ulink&gt;. Modifications such as bromination of the benzocycloheptapyridine nucleus at C(10) and substitution of an N-acetyl carbamoylpiperidine for a pyrid-4-ylmethyl amide increased the potency and t1/2 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308731"&gt;308731&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, the use of 1-carboxamidopiperidine-4-ylacetyl groups also improved the pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308731"&gt;308731&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Second generation farnesyltransferase inhibitors to follow &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; are being investigated (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19711"&gt;Schering-Plough Corp&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18723"&gt;Pharmacopeia Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;). Modifications of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; that incorporate amides, acids, esters, ureas and lactams off the first or distal piperidine (from the tricycle) promise to further improve pharmacokinetic properties [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="475243"&gt;475243&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Crystal structures of several imidazole-containing lead compounds bound to farnesyl transferase have lead to the discovery of a new series of 3-(1H-imaidazol-1-ylmethyl) piperidinyl-substituted benzocycloheptapyridine inhibitors; lead compounds identified from this series are orally bioavailable and have demonstrated efficacy in tumor growth inhibition mouse xenograft models [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="475289"&gt;475289&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The imidazole-containing analog Sch-226374 has an improved cellular potency and pharmacokinetic profile over Sch-66336 in the monkey, with 68% bioavailability and half-life of 4.4 h. Sch-226374 has IC50 values of of 360 pM (FT) and 13.5 microM (geranylgeranyltransferase-I; GGTP) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="419311"&gt;419311&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="420310"&gt;420310&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;Lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; is a specific FT inhibitor, with IC50 values of 1.9 nM (H-ras), 5.2 nM (K-ras), and 2.8 nM (N-ras). The compound also inhibits H-ras processing with an IC50 value of 10 nM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="284017"&gt;284017&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="289610"&gt;289610&lt;/ulink&gt;]; the IC50 value for geranyl-geranyl-transferase protein is &amp;gt; 40 microM. Synergistic or additive antiproliferative activity was observed in a range of tumor cell lines when &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; was combined with its analog &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8762"&gt;Sch-58500&lt;/ulink&gt;. Furthermore, an overall additive antiproliferative activity was observed for the three-drug combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8762"&gt;Sch-58500&lt;/ulink&gt; and paclitaxel in the DU-145 human tumor cell line [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="359068"&gt;359068&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;Lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; strongly synergizes in vitro with paclitaxel and in vivo evidence of synergistic interaction has been also observed, both in the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20519"&gt;NCI&lt;/ulink&gt; 460 human lung carcinoma xenograft and in the wap-ras (paclitaxel resistant) transgenic mouse model [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="475315"&gt;475315&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Additive interaction has been observed between &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; in four human tumor cell lines, and in in vivo models. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;Lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; has also been combined in vitro with cisplatin, and a cell line-specific, sequence dependent interaction between the two drugs has been demonstrated [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="488775"&gt;488775&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="447641"&gt;447641&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The molecular basis for the synergistic effects of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR1) substrates may be explained by the ability of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; to potently inhibit P-gp. In fact, in a NIH-G185 cell line overexpressing the human transporter P-gp, in which known P-gp inhibitors including cyclosporin A, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44437"&gt;verapamil&lt;/ulink&gt; and tamoxifen inhibited the P-gp mediated efflux of daunorubicin, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; significantly inhibited daunorubicin transport with an IC50 value of approximately 3 microM, and affected the transport of rhodamine 123 with a potency similar to cyclosporin A. In addition, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; was shown to decrease P-gp-mediated ATP hydrolysis by &amp;gt; 70% with a Km of 3 microM, indicating that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; directly interacts with the substrate binding site of P-gp [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="404862"&gt;404862&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="475291"&gt;475291&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Co-administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and P-gp substrates could potentially reduce chemotherapy dosage.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Inhibition of tumor cell growth was seen in a soft agar cloning assay with various human tumors, using 0.1 to 2.5 microM &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="341339"&gt;341339&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At 2.5 microM, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; inhibited the growth of 50% of breast tumors, 40% of ovarian tumors and 38% of non-small cell lung tumor colony forming units. Perhaps more importantly, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; (2.5 microM) was effective against 27, 38, 33 and 27% of tumor specimens that were resistant to doxorubicin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, and etoposide, respectively, from a total of 69 specimans tested [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="341339"&gt;341339&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In nude mice, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; had oral activity against a wide range of tumor xenograft models, such as colon, lung, pancreas, prostate, urinary bladder [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308279"&gt;308279&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In Ha-ras transgenic mice, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; delayed tumor onset, reduced the numbers of tumors, and reduced tumor weight if administered before tumor onset. If administered after tumors had developed it inhibited tumor growth and resulted in tumor regression [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="284669"&gt;284669&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Several tumor models have been shown to be sensitive to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;. Following &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; administration (40 mg/kg/day for 3 to 4 weeks), activity was shown against many early-stage K-ras tumor models including the colon DLD1 and HCT116 models, lung HTB177 and pancreas MIAPaCa [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="284669"&gt;284669&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, higher activity was shown against H-ras models [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="289610"&gt;289610&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The efficacy of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; was evaluated in vivo in five established glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines, as well as against two human GBM tumor xenograft models in NOD-SCID mice. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;Lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; demonstrated potent efficacy in both models. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;Lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; was shown to selectively inhibit hematopoietic colony formation of primary human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, demonstrating the potential for therapy of bcr-abl-induced leukemia [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="393821"&gt;393821&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; resistant bcr-abl leukemia cells, treatment with combinations of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; displayed additive or synergistic effects; the combination inhibited hematopoietic colony formation in primary cultures from CML patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="447194"&gt;447194&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Combinations of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; with AraC had additive effects as well, whereas combinations of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; with daunorubicin or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3072"&gt;etopophos&lt;/ulink&gt; displayed antagonistic effects [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432578"&gt;432578&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432852"&gt;432852&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="503545"&gt;503545&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The activity of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; in six human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) cell lines was assessed. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;Lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; suppressed the growth of these cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner; inhibition was more than 50% in cells treated with 1 microM &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; for 4 days [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="447037"&gt;447037&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In SqCC/Y1, the cell line most sensitive to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, expression and phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic factor AKT was suppressed after 14 days of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="447037"&gt;447037&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Another study showed the antiproliferative effects of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; in B16 cells (IC50 = 1.0 microM), Colo 853 cells (IC50 = 3.1 microM), and induction of apoptosis in B16 (6.0 +/- 1.1%) and Colo 853 cells (7.9 +/- 1.1%) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="447641"&gt;447641&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;Lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; (1.5 microM) also suppressed AKT expression and phosphorylation in the HNSCC cell line UMSCC38 in parallel with suppression of phosphorylated Raf [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="447643"&gt;447643&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A recent study has demonstrated that the combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and the synthetic retinoid 4 hydroxyfenylretinamide (4 HPR) can act synergistically in the induction of apoptosis in human HNSCC cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484376"&gt;484376&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Recent interesting data have also shown that the combination of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGF-BP)-3 and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; act synergistically to induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="499109"&gt;499109&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism &lt;/subtitle&gt;Studies in cynomologous monkeys indicated an oral bioavailability of 50%, a t1/2 of 3 h after intravenous administration [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308731"&gt;308731&lt;/ulink&gt;] and no racemization in vivo [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="341342"&gt;341342&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In athymic nude mice, an oral dose of 25 mg/kg resulted in a Cmax of 8.8 microM, with drug levels persisting at a concentration above 700 nM for 9h; oral bioavailability was 76% and t1/2  after intravenous administration was 1.4 h [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308279"&gt;308279&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In rats, plasma Cmax values of 3, 10 and 30 microM were achieved after single oral doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308279"&gt;308279&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Clinical studies showed that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; was slowly absorbed [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326237"&gt;326237&lt;/ulink&gt;], and pharmacokinetics were non linear [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326233"&gt;326233&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="456851"&gt;456851&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a dose-escalating phase I study in 24 patients, peak plasma concentrations and AUC values increased in a greater than dose proportional manner; at continuous oral twice daily doses of 25, 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg, Cmax values were 63.9 +/- 2.24, 156 +/- 96.1, 333 +/- 70.6, 1380 +/- 728, 2900 +/- 1290 and 3610 +/- 1290 ng/ml while AUC values were 0.397 +/- 0.167, 1.35 +/- 0.955, 2.46 +/- 1.96, 17.7 +/- 14.4, 56.4 +/- 20.0 and 69.1 +/- 16.5 microg.h/ml, respectively. Apparent clearance of the drug (CL/F) decreased exponentially from 1190 +/- 462 ml/min to 101 +/- 27.3 ml/min, while Vdss/F decreased from 331 +/- 27 to 90.4 +/- 22.4 l between the 25 mg and 400 mg doses, respectively. Plasma half-life ranged from 4 to 11 h and increased with increasing doses. Cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged drug was dose-independent and accounted for less than 0.02% of the administered dose. Mean renal clearance was estimated at 0.117 +/- 0.0105 ml/min, suggesting that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; is not cleared by renal processes [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="456851"&gt;456851&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Analysis of data from a phase I study in 19 advanced hematologic malignancy patients revealed a Cmax at 200 and 300 mg of 2.963 +/- 57 and 3.845 +/- 71 microg.h/ml, respectively, and Tmax values of 4 and 6 h [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="473985"&gt;473985&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The preliminary analysis of another phase I study, in which &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; was delivered twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 28 days (25 to 300 mg), suggested that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; undergoes slow absorption, complex and non-linear pharmacokinetics, approximately 2- to 5-fold steady state accumulation at day 14, and considerable inter-patient variability [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326237"&gt;326237&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Preliminary data from combination studies revealed that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; pharmacokinetics do not appear to be influenced by concomitant &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; administration [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="451831"&gt;451831&lt;/ulink&gt;], and no interaction was detected between &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and paclitaxel [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="501329"&gt;501329&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;In mice bearing human tumor xenografts (of either lung, colon, pancreas or prostate origin) &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; administered by oral gavage (using 20% hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin as a delivery vehicle) at a doses ranging from 2.5 to 40 mg/kg (qid) 5 to 10% weight loss was observed in some cases; however, weight loss also occurred in some of the vehicle alone-treated groups and was attributed to frequent oral gavavge [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308279"&gt;308279&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a 3-month toxicology study in monkeys using a 15-mg/kg/day dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, the only finding was increased liver weights [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="456851"&gt;456851&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I monotherapy studies&lt;/subtitle&gt;Four single-agent phase I trials, including three fully published studies, have been carried out with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, using four different oral delivery schedules; twice a day on days 1 to 7 every 21 days (25 to 400 mg) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326233"&gt;326233&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="367144"&gt;367144&lt;/ulink&gt;], twice a day on days 1 to 14 every 28 days (25 to 300 mg) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326237"&gt;326237&lt;/ulink&gt;], twice a day continuously (25 to 400 mg) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326235"&gt;326235&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="456851"&gt;456851&lt;/ulink&gt;] and once a day continuously (300 to 400 mg) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="488778"&gt;488778&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The toxicity profile observed in these trials has been fairly similar, since gastrointestinal tract toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and fatigue have generally qualified as dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Myelosuppression was not generally observed at the doses that were recommended for phase II. Since farnesylation is a crucial reaction for photoreceptor synthesis, concern was placed on ocular function in all of these trials, but no abnormalities were ever recorded. One objective response was observed in the American study using the 1 to 7 every 21 days schedule [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="367144"&gt;367144&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this study, which had the additional value of highlighting the importance of prelamin A accumulation in buccal mucosal smears as a biological endpoint for in vivo evaluation of farnesyl transferase inhibition, a patient with pretreated NSCLC achieved a confirmed partial response (PR). A number of disease stabilizations were observed in each of the four studies. Since a continuous exposure to a competitive inhibitor is the best way to achieve target enzyme inhibition, the continuous schedule was chosen for further trials with this compound, and 200 mg bid was selected as the recommended dose (RD) for phase II studies [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="456851"&gt;456851&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A further phase I study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; in advanced hematologic malignancies was recently carried out [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="474035"&gt;474035&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="473985"&gt;473985&lt;/ulink&gt;]; nineteen patients were enrolled in three cohorts to assess the maximum tolerated dose, clinical activity, and pharmacokinetics of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; (200 to 400 mg bid). The most common adverse events observed in 17 evaluable patients were grade 1 to 2 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Dose limiting toxicities were grade 3 diarrhea and grade 4 hypokalemia; the recommended dose for phase II was 200 mg bid. Clinical activity was noted in six patients and hematologic improvement was observed in three out of five chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients. DNA-J farnesylation was inhibited at all doses. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase I/II trial in patients with MDS or secondary AML (&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; delivered 200 mg bid), there were two partial responses from 12 evaluable patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="473645"&gt;473645&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A phase IB study was undertaken in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who were randomized to receive either &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; (100, 200 or 300 mg bid) or best supportive care for up to 14 days prior to surgery. Gastrointestinal side effects were observed, but no DLT was reached. Four out of 21 evaluable patients had a PR; analysis of the surrogate marker DNA-J (HDJ-2), a farnesylated chaperone protein, in surgical samples revealed an increase in non-farnesylated protein in patients treated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="408759"&gt;408759&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="409890"&gt;409890&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;br/&gt; &lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II monotherapy studies&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;Lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; has been evaluated in several phase II monotherapy studies. In particular, a phase II study comparing &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer has been carried out. Patients were randomized to receive treatment with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; at a dose of 200 mg bid or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 7 weeks followed by one week of rest. This study showed no statistically significant differences between the two treatment arms in terms of objective responses, 3-month progression-free survival (23% for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, and 31% for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt;), and median overall survival (3.3 months for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, 4.4 months for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt;). Toxicity (in particular hematologic) was lower in the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; arm [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="410384"&gt;410384&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;Lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; was also investigated as a second-line treatment of bladder carcinoma (200 mg bid), but little activity and an unfavorable toxicity profile emerged in this study [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="410458"&gt;410458&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In particular, only one evaluable patient achieved stable disease, while all of the others progressed. Drug-related grade 3 to 4 non-hematologic toxicities included fatigue, anorexia, nausea &amp;amp; vomiting, confusion, dehydration and dyspnea, while grade 3 to 4 myelotoxicity was infrequent. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase II study of continuous oral &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; is being carried out in advanced hematologic malignancies as well [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="474026"&gt;474026&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Up to now, 10 hematologic responses have been observed in 54 evaluable patients (19%), while one out of 19 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia had a pathologic response. Toxicity in this trial has been moderate, and preliminary activity results are considered encouraging. Although it is likely that most of the future efforts with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; will be carried out in combination studies, a broad phase II program, including studies in melanoma and colorectal cancer, is in the pipeline to identify the most chemosensitive diseases to direct further efforts towards.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I/ II combination studies&lt;/subtitle&gt;A phase I pharmacokinetic (PK) trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; in advanced cancers has been recently carried out. DLT in this study were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and myelosuppression. The RD for phase II was 150/100 mg for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, and 1000 mg/m2 for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt;. Two partial responses (both in pancreatic cancer), and two minimal responses (one in pancreatic cancer, one in mesothelioma) were observed; eleven patients had long lasting (&gt; 6 months) stable disease [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="369483"&gt;369483&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Following the above study, the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;-&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; combination was moved into phase II. In particular, this regimen has been used as second line treatment in patients with advanced/metastatic bladder carcinoma who had not received &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; as first line treatment. From 33 patients, there were three complete responses and ten partial responses giving an overall response rate of 39.5% (95% CI: 23 to 58). Six patients achieved stable disease with a median duration of 8.8 months [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="491527"&gt;491527&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase I/II study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and paclitaxel in patients with solid tumors has recently been presented [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="501329"&gt;501329&lt;/ulink&gt;]; patients with advanced solid tumors who had failed prior therapy were given &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; (100, 125 or 150 mg bid) and paclitaxel (135 or 175 mg/m2). Myelosuppression was the DLT in this study; RDs were 100 mg bid &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and 175 mg/m2 paclitaxel. Objective responses were seen in patients with NSCLC, head and neck cancer and salivary gland tumors. In particular, in the subset of patients with NSCLC, there was one PR from the two patients receiving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; as first line treatment, three PRs from the five patients receiving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; as second line treatment and one PR from the four patients receiving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; as a third line treatment. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Following the encouraging results observed mainly in NSCLC, a further phase I/II study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; (100 mg bid) and paclitaxel (175 mg iv over 3 hrs) was undertaken in patients with taxane refractory/resistant NSCLC [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="447141"&gt;447141&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Febrile neutropenia, fatigue and diarrhea represented the main toxicities observed in the study. Of the 33 evaluable patients, five partial responses (15%), four minimal responses (12%) and ten cases of stable diseases (33%) were observed.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Phase I or I/II clinical programs for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; include studies in combination with paclitaxel (solid tumors, n = 33), [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="447141"&gt;447141&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="451806"&gt;451806&lt;/ulink&gt;], paclitaxel and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44383"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; (solid tumors, n = 27) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="453138"&gt;453138&lt;/ulink&gt;], &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2953"&gt;docetaxel&lt;/ulink&gt; (solid tumors, n = 13) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="453443"&gt;453443&lt;/ulink&gt;], &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; (CML)  (&lt;ulink url="http://clinicaltrials.gov"&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/ulink&gt;) &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6386"&gt;trastuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; and paclitaxel (breast cancer, ongoing) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="504360"&gt;504360&lt;/ulink&gt;], and cisplatin-&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; (advanced cancers, n = 14) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="451813"&gt;451813&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Preliminary data has been presented from a phase I, pharmacokinetic and biological study of the combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, cisplatin, and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; in advanced solid tumors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="451813"&gt;451813&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and diarrhea were DLT in this study, while the RD for phase II has not yet been selected. Preliminary data using a Scintillator Proximity Assay demonstrated that the FTase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreased in seven out of eight patients (median decrement 37.5%).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Sprague et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="453138"&gt;453138&lt;/ulink&gt;] are carrying out a phase I study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, paclitaxel and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44383"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; in refractory or advanced solid tumors.  A total of 27 patients with histologically confirmed solid tumors and no more than three prior chemotherapy regimens have been enrolled up to now. Neutropenia and diarrhea have been the only observed DLTs, while the RD for phase II has not yet been reached. Preliminary results suggest that the combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, paclitaxel, and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44383"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; is well tolerated, and clinically relevant doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44383"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; and paclitaxel can be achieved.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III studies &lt;/subtitle&gt;A pivotal multicenter program in NSCLC has been launced with a phase III combination study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44383"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt;-paclitaxel with or without &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink url="http://clinicaltrials.gov"&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/ulink&gt;). Details of the trial protocol were provided by the Arlington Cancer Center, USA; patients will receive taxol (175 mg/m2 iv, every 21 days) and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44383"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; (AUC 6, iv every 21 days) in combination with either &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; (100 mg bid) or placebo bid (&lt;ulink url="http://www.acctx.com"&gt;http://www.acctx.com&lt;/ulink&gt;). &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications &lt;/subtitle&gt;Gastrointestinal toxicity and fatigue were the most frequently encountered toxicities at the doses recommended for phase II, and they were normally dose limiting. In particular, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and anorexia represented the most frequent and serious side effects. Myelosuppression was normally not observed at the doses recommended for phase II, but it became dose limiting when these doses were exceeded. Toxicities that are frequently observed with other farnesyl transferase inhibitors, such as neurotoxicity, liver toxicity and cardiac disturbances were normally not observed with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326237"&gt;326237&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="367144"&gt;367144&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="456851"&gt;456851&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="488778"&gt;488778&lt;/ulink&gt;]. When &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; was used in combination with cytotoxic compounds, myelosuppression became dose limiting [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="491527"&gt;491527&lt;/ulink&gt;], and no unexpected toxicities were seen. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;The development of FT inhibitors represents a good example of translational research being moved into clinical practice. Originally designed to target tumors with mutated ras, FT inhibitors may also target tumors with upregulated growth factor pathways that signal through normal wild-type ras. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;Lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17113"&gt;tipifarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; (R-11577, Zarnestra; &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17413"&gt;Janssen Pharmaceutica BV&lt;/ulink&gt;) are the first FT inhibitors to have entered clinical trials. During phase I evaluation, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; was tested with both intermittent and continuous schedules. The toxicity profiles were fairly similar, but the continuous schedule was chosen for phase II evaluation, as it was thought that the continuous presence of a competitive inhibitor would be needed to achieve complete target enzyme inhibition. The toxicity profile of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; is manageable since the main toxicities are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fatigue, and myelosuppression is generally not observed at conventional doses. Neurotoxicity, which is frequently encountered with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17113"&gt;tipifarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;, particularly when it is used in the continuous schedule, is rarely observed with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;; liver toxicity, which is the main toxicity observed with oral &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7342"&gt;BMS-214662&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15065"&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co&lt;/ulink&gt;), and which has, along with gastrointestinal toxicity, actually prevented &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7342"&gt;BMS-214662&lt;/ulink&gt; from being administered by the oral route, is again rarely observed with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Pharmacodynamic evaluation of biochemical endpoints (mainly prelamin A accumulation in buccal mucosal smear and peripheral blood mononuclear cell inhibition of FTase activity) is theoretically helpful in identifying the most suitable dose for further &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; evaluation, both alone and in combination. Combining &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; with conventional cytotoxics is probably the most effective way of using the drug, and very encouraging preclinical data were obtained especially with the combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and P-gp substrate drugs, such as taxanes, thus lending support to the experimental evidence of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;-induced P-gp modulation. The encouraging preclinical and clinical data for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; and paclitaxel in NSCLC have prompted the evaluation of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; in the currently ongoing phase III study in first-line therapy for NSCLC (&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44383"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt;/paclitaxel with or without &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt;). Studies such as this will help to clarify if the addition of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="17472"&gt;lonafarnib&lt;/ulink&gt; improves survival. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;FT inhibitors (and equally, other biologic compounds) create significant problems for appropriate study design. All of the studies conducted to date have been performed in advanced disease. However, other settings, such as maintenance therapy, or a role as an adjuvant, may be equally or even more appropriate. Several problems also arise with regard to selection criteria (whether to restrict studies to tumors with ras mutations?), concomitant treatments (single agent studies versus combinations) and choice of endpoint (response rate, progression free survival, overall survival). Further concerns address the level of pathway blockade. Interference with an upstream-intermediate target, such as ras, may limit the range of treatable tumors to those that express the mutation, with the advantage of a higher specificity, and a reduced potential for toxicity. On the other hand, blocking a downstream target, such as MEK, may abrogate a number of different signaling pathways, which impinge on this molecule, thus allowing for targeting of a broad range of tumors at the expense of a greater potential for toxicity. It is currently not known which of the two approaches will be more effective; and to further complicate the issue, combined blockade at different pathway levels is an approach that is currently being strongly pursued.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Peter Norman, Norman Consulting, Burnham, UK&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;3 November 1999&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Schering-Plough is developing a series of farnesyl-protein transferase (FTPase) inhibitors as orally-active antitumor agents. One of these compounds, Sch-66336, had progressed to phase II by February 1999 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="335366"&gt;335366&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Sch-66336 entered phase I trials in November 1997 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="279661"&gt;279661&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="289610"&gt;289610&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Phase I trial results were presented at the 35th ASCO meeting in 1999. Sch-66336 undergoes slow absorption, non-linear pharmacokinetics and significant interpatient variability; in 14 patients the half-life (t1/2) of the compound ranged from 4.8 to 17.6 h. The recommended phase II dose was chosen to be 200 mg bid, [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326233"&gt;326233&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326235"&gt;326235&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326237"&gt;326237&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A reduction in platelets was seen [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326268"&gt;326268&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Against farnesyl transferase, Sch-66336 displays IC50 values of 1.9 nM (H-Ras), 5.2 nM (K-Ras) and 2.8 nM (N-Ras). The compound also inhibits H-ras processing with an IC50 value of 10 nM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="284017"&gt;284017&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="289610"&gt;289610&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Several animal tumor models are sensitive to Sch-66336. Following daily oral administration (40 mg/kg/day for 3 to 4 weeks), activity was shown against many early-stage K-ras tumor models, including the colon DLD1 and HCT116 models, the lung HTB177 and the pancreas MIAPaCa. Further, higher activity was shown against H-ras models [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="289610"&gt;289610&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the nude mouse model, Sch-66336 had oral activity against a wide range of human tumor xenografts. In Ha-Ras transgenic mice, it delayed tumor onset, reduced the number of tumors and reduced tumor weight when administered before tumor onset. It also inhibited tumor growth and resulted in tumor regression if administered after tumors had developed [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="284669"&gt;284669&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Earlier compounds, such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15000"&gt;Sch-44342&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="24009"&gt;Schering-Plough Research Institute&lt;/ulink&gt;), suffered from poor pharmacokinetics but Sch-66336 is improved in this respect. In mouse and monkey studies it demonstrated 76% and 50% bioavailability, respectively, and t1/2 values of 1.4 h and 3 h [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="284017"&gt;284017&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Sch-66336 was prepared by condensation of 5-bromo-3-methylpyridine-2-carboxamide and 3-chlorobenzylbromide, followed by dehydration and cyclization to provide an 11-oxo- benzocycloheptapyridine. Reaction with a 4-methylpiperidinyl Grignard reagent led to formation of Sch-66336 in four further steps, including a chiral resolution [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308731"&gt;308731&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Extensive SAR data on this series of compounds has now been published, starting from the initial reports on the less potent &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15000"&gt;Sch-44342&lt;/ulink&gt;, which suffered from a very short t1/2 in vivo. Bromination of the benzocycloheptapyridine nucleus at C-10 and substitution of an N-acetyl carbamoylpiperidine for a pyrid-4-ylmethyl amide increased the potency nearly 200-fold, in addition to a substantial increase in t1/2 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308731"&gt;308731&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, the use of 1-carboxamidopiperidine-4-ylacetyl groups also improved the pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of these compounds [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308731"&gt;308731&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;SAR studies on the ring substitution of Sch-66336 derivatives have shown that both the 8- and 10-halo substituents may be replaced by 8-methyl and 10-methoxy groups, respectively, without loss of potency [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="342321"&gt;342321&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, studies investigating the 3-substituent indicated that a 3-bromo constituent was critical for good activity, at least within the 8-methyl-10-methoxy-benzocycloheptapyridine series [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="330504"&gt;330504&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;One problem seen with some compounds in this series is activity at M1 and /or M2 receptors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="287030"&gt;287030&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In further studies, nicotinamide, oxalamide and alkylamide derivatives were well absorbed and maintained good serum levels in mice, when administered orally. Nanomolar potency in the inhibition of FTPase-mediated farnesylation of Ras was observed with a number of compounds, in addition to Sch-66336 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="335366"&gt;335366&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Crystallographic studies on compounds, including Sch-66336, bound to farnesyl-protein transferase have shown that the tricyclic ring spans the active site cavity and interacts with both protein atoms and the isoprenoid portion of bound farnesyl diphosphate [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="331411"&gt;331411&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This binding mode was observed for a number of halogenated derivatives.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Sch-66336 inhibits the isolated H-Ras FTPase with an IC50 value of 1.9 nM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308731"&gt;308731&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It has similar potencies against both K-Ras (5.2 nM) and N-Ras (2.8 nM) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="284017"&gt;284017&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Sch-66336 also inhibits H-ras processing with an IC50 value of 10 nM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="289610"&gt;289610&lt;/ulink&gt;]. When tested in soft agar assays, Sch-66336 is less potent and appears somewhat selective for H-Ras over K-Ras [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="284017"&gt;284017&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At micromolar concentrations, Sch-66336 effectively inhibits the growth of a range of human tumors in vitro [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="341339"&gt;341339&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At 2.5 microM, it inhibited growth of breast tumors, ovarian tumors and non-small cell lung tumor colony-forming units by 38 to 50%. Perhaps more significantly, it was also effective in preventing the growth of 27 to 38% of tumor specimens resistant to a variety of other chemotherapeutic agents [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="341339"&gt;341339&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a nude mouse model of K-ras-dependent DLD1 tumors, a 50 mg/kg oral dose of Sch-66336 substantially inhibited tumor growth [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308731"&gt;308731&lt;/ulink&gt;]. When administered at high doses (40 mg/kg qid), Sch-66336 completely inhibited the growth of both EJ bladder and NIH 3T3-CVLS cell xenografts [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="284017"&gt;284017&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In further models of human tumor xenografts in the nude mouse, Sch-66336 demonstrated potent oral activity against a wide array of colon, lung, pancreas, prostate and urinary bladder tumors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308279"&gt;308279&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These included colon HCT116, lung HTB177 and pancreas MIAPaCa tumors. When administered prophylactically (40 mg/kg/day), Sch-66336 delayed both tumor onset and tumor growth. It also produced dose-dependent tumor regression when administered symptomatically. Enhanced in vivo efficacy was observed when Sch-66336 was combined with the cytotoxic agents, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and vincristine [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308279"&gt;308279&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;Little metabolic data have yet been reported for Sch-66336. However, one study in primates indicated that no racemization occurred in vivo [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="341342"&gt;341342&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Pharmacokinetic studies in primates have indicated that Sch-66336 has a t1/2 of 3 h and an oral bioavailability of 50% [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308731"&gt;308731&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the mouse, Sch-66336 was 76% bioavailable, with a t1/2 of 1.4 h [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="284017"&gt;284017&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;No data are currently available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;Phase I studies of the tolerability of Sch-66336 examined the effects of oral dosing for one week (doses ranging from 25 mg to 400 mg bid), followed by a 3-week rest period. Inhibition of farnesylation in the buccal mucosa cells of treated patients was used as a surrogate marker in these studies [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326233"&gt;326233&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Other studies examined the effects of continuous dosing over 2 weeks [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326235"&gt;326235&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326237"&gt;326237&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;Phase II studies with a 200 mg bid dose have just commenced [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="335366"&gt;335366&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;Both fatigue and gastrointestinal toxicity were found to be dose-limiting in phase I studies [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="325696"&gt;325696&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Some reduction in platelet number was also observed. In the limited number of patients, Sch-66336 displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics resulting in significant interpatient variability [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="326237"&gt;326237&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It was also slowly absorbed.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Sch-66336 is a potent, orally active inhibitor of FTPase. It appears to be the most advanced of the three inhibitors currently reported to be in clinical development, with phase II studies having commenced in 1999. In vitro, Sch-66336 appears to be of comparable potency to Janssen's R-115777, as an FTPase inhibitor. Although Merck's &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11497"&gt;L-778123&lt;/ulink&gt; is reported to be more potent, it is being developed as an infusible formulation. Other companies developing such agents (eg, Parke-Davis) have not yet progressed compounds to phase I study.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Schering-Plough and Merck have both described many other FTPase inhibitors of comparable or better potency, and a number of other companies are also developing such inhibitors, which are progressing towards clinical development. The key issues would thus appear to be clinical efficacy and side effect profiles, although the use of oral formulations is likely to be preferred.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The evidence from animal and cellular studies appears to underline the key role of FTPase in the growth of many tumor cells. In addition, the reports that indicate that Sch-66336 is effective in preventing the growth of some tumors resistant to other chemotherapeutic agents suggests that such compounds should provide a useful new class of chemotherapeutic agents. This highlights the potential utility of such inhibitors but there are currently insufficient published data to confirm that such compounds do not adversely interfere with other enzymes in the isoprenoid pathways, although they are selective in in vitro assays. However, the limited toxicity data reported with orally active inhibitors does suggest that this is not likely to be a major problem.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Clinical studies with the three FTPase inhibitors have all observed dose-limiting side effects but these appear to differ for each compound suggesting that they are mechanism-independent. As &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11497"&gt;L-778123&lt;/ulink&gt;, R-115777 and Sch-66336 represent three distinct chemical classes, and only &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11497"&gt;L-778123&lt;/ulink&gt; contains a free thiol group, this is not unexpected. Fatigue appears to be the only side effect common to the three compounds.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Sch-66336 is also reported to display gastrointestinal toxicity whilst R-115777 caused mild neutropenia and thrombopenia and mild reversible renal injury. These appear less serious than the side effects reported for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11497"&gt;L-778123&lt;/ulink&gt; but may reflect lower systemic concentrations of the less-potent Sch-66336. The publication of detailed reports, and of early phase II results will be eagerly awaited since they will provide a clearer indication of the tolerability and efficacy of such agents.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="1007957">The Progeria Research Foundation Inc</Company><Country id="US">US</Country><DevelopmentStatus
