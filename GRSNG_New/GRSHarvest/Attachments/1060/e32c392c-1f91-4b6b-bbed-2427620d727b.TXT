Of all seven patients, five patients showed substantial increase in CD68-expressing cells and four patients showed substantial increase in the density of CD4-expressing cells.  An increase in PDL1 MF1 expression was observed in four patients. Mean increase in expression of genes associated with B cells (+87%), CD+ T cells (+106%), CD8+ T cells (+6%) and dendritic cells (+130%) were seen. Neoadjuvant IRX-2 was a powerful modulator of the tumor microenvironment, driving intratunoral immune infiltration of T cells, B cells and dendritic cells and promoted their activation [&lt;ulink linkID="1963000" linkType="Reference"&gt;1963000&lt;/ulink&gt;] [&lt;ulink linkID="1960967" linkType="Reference"&gt;1960967&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By February 2005, IRx Therapeutics expected a phase III trial to begin in the first quarter of 2005, and expected to accrue over 300 patients over 40 to 50 clinical sites [&lt;ulink linkID="586803" linkType="Reference"&gt;586803&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By October 2007, the company reported at the 15th Annual BioPartnering meeting in London, UK that a very favorable safety profile and increased survival rates gave rise to a multicenter phase III trial being planned in 500 patients worldwide, especially in the US and Europe [&lt;ulink linkID="838711" linkType="Reference"&gt;838711&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2016, a phase IIb trial was   planned [&lt;ulink linkID="1728071" linkType="Reference"&gt;1728071&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In March 2017, data from a phase IIa trial in patients (expected n = 27) with SCCHN demonstrated that neoadjuvant IRX-2 stimulated lymphocyte infiltration (LI) into the tumors, and greater LI was associated with longer survival. The overall 5-year survival rate was 65% (17/26), and there was a greater than 80% probability of survival at 5 years in patients with a large change in LI after treatment. There were no drug-related deaths reported  [&lt;ulink linkID="1909214" linkType="Reference"&gt;1909214&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2014, it was reported at the 32nd Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, CA, that a 200-subject, randomized, multicenter phase IIb trial was expected to begin in 2014 in the US and EU, with target endpoint being disease-free survival.

In July 2008, data from a multicenter, phase II trial in 27 patients with operable head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (HN SCC)   were presented at the American Head and Neck Society's 7th International conference on Head and Neck Cancer in San Francisco, CA. A significant change in immune cells consistent with an anti-tumor response was observed and some patients experienced tumor shrinkage. At 18 months post-treatment, 13 of 16 subjects in the Stage IVa cohort treated with IRX-2 were alive. The drug was well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="927183" linkType="Reference"&gt;927183&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2005, a open label, single group assigned, phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="38070" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00210470&lt;/ulink&gt;; IRX-2 2005-A) was initiated in the US, in patients(n = 27) with operable head and neck cancer to assess the safety of IRX-2.

The trial included 42 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), with 39 patients subsequently undergoing surgery, and 22 stage IV patients receiving additional radiotherapy; Complete and partial responses were observed in 42% of patients. Over 36 months, the overall survival of patients treated with IRX-2 was 65% compared to 32% receiving placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="586869" linkType="Reference"&gt;586869&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="586803" linkType="Reference"&gt;586803&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="586783" linkType="Reference"&gt;586783&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2003, phase II data were presented at the Fifth Annual Colloquium for Cancer Vaccines and Immunology in the Bahamas. Patients received 10 to 20 days treatment with IRX-2. In 29 patients 52% had greater or equal to 50% tumor shrinkage with three complete responses. Survival was 69% versus 28% for surgery alone at 48 months. IRX-2 drove tumor composition changes and the extent of solid tumor was reduced from 79 to 25% pre- versus post- vaccination [&lt;ulink linkID="484695" linkType="reference"&gt;484695&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were presented at the 39th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL [&lt;ulink linkID="493530" linkType="Reference"&gt;493530&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 1997, data were published. At 3 weeks prior to surgery, 20 stage II to IV head and neck  SCC patients received cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2), 10 daily perilymphatic injections of IRX-2 and daily po indomethacin and zinc.

At that time, the trial was expected to complete in November 2018   [&lt;ulink linkID="1909310" linkType="Reference"&gt;1909310&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2017, preliminary data were presented at the 32nd annual meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in National Harbor, MD. Data demonstrated that IRX-2 modulates the tumor microenvironment in early stage breast cancer cells and increases stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, T-cell activation, T-regulatory cell depletion, and up-regulates PD-L1. Overall, the drug was well-tolerated. At that time, final data were expected in 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1981300" linkType="Reference"&gt;1981300&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. No treatment‐related surgical delays and complications or grade III/IV toxicities were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="1984302" linkType="Reference"&gt;1984302&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2018, final results from 16 patients were presented at the 41st Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in San Antonio, TX. All patients completed and tolerated the regimen. Common adverse events attributed to IRX-2 injections (occurred in &amp;gt; 15% of patients) were injection site reaction (grade 1, n=8), bruising (grade 1, n=7), and pain (grade 1, n=3) while attributed to low-dose cyclophosphamide were fatigue (grade 1, n=5) and nausea (grade 1/2, n=3). There was an increase in stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes score (p = 0.04), with four patients sTIL-low tumors (0 to 10% score) which was re-categorized to sTIL-moderate (11 to 50% score). There was an increase in PD-L1 RNA expression (p = 0.04) in 12 tumors (median 57% increase) and Nanostring NK, Th1 cell signatures were also increased [&lt;ulink linkID="2104080" linkType="Reference"&gt;2104080&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Cervical cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;In August 2017, a randomised, parallel-assigned, two-cohort phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="311434" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT03267680&lt;/ulink&gt;; 5GYN-16-2; NCI-2017-01402; 5GYN-16-2; P30CA014089) was to be initiated in October 2017 in women (expected n = 60) with cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 3 or squamous vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia 3, to evaluate IRX-2 regimen.
