In February 2017, interim results  were presented at the 13th Annual Lysosomal Disease Network WORLD Symposium in San Diego, CA. Patients completing the 190-201 study continued to receive intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa (300 mg, qow) for up to 240 weeks. Adverse events were reported by all patients, and the common ones were grade 1 to 2 events. In cerliponase alfa treated patients, significant attenuation of the rate of decline in motor and language score was observed compared with untreated patients (0.32 versus 2.0 points/48 weeks, respectively). The responder (&amp;lt; 2 point loss) rate at week-81 (87%) was comparable to rate at week-48   [&lt;ulink linkID="1900573" linkType="Reference"&gt;1900573&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1901605" linkType="Reference"&gt;1901605&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2017, further data were presented at the 13th ICIEM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in all patients and were of grade 1 to 2 severity. The common AEs reported were pyrexia, hypersensitivity and convulsion [&lt;ulink linkID="1966171" linkType="Reference"&gt;1966171&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2017, further data were presented at the 71st American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting in Washington DC. At least one serious AE was reported by 20 patients, which was mostly consistent with neurodegenerative disease in a pediatric population. At week 96, there was an improvement in responder rate (100%, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) when compared to week 48 which suggested that the treatment had a persistent treatment effect [&lt;ulink linkID="1992594" linkType="Reference"&gt;1992594&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2018, further year two results were presented at the 14th Annual Lysosomal Disease Network WORLD Symposium in San Diego, CA. When compared to rate of decline of 2.0 points/48 weeks in untreated patients, treated patients demonstrated a significant attenuation in the rate of decline in motor and language score to a median of 0.27 points/48 weeks. When compared to week 48, patients achieved 100% improvement in responder (&amp;lt; 2 point loss per 48 weeks) rate at week 96 (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), which suggested that effect of treatment was persistent [&lt;ulink linkID="2009562" linkType="Reference"&gt;2009562&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In May 2018, the study was expected to complete in January 2021 [&lt;ulink linkID="2068055" linkType="Reference"&gt;2068055&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2018, further data were presented at the 2018 SSIEM Annual Symposium in Athens, Greece. At 96 weeks, the responder rate (87%, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) was stable compared to 48 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="2068464" linkType="Reference"&gt;2068464&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were reported in November 2018. All 23 enrolled patients showed continued maintenance of stabilization of disease for 3 years or more as measured by the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale as compared to untreated patients from a natural history cohort [&lt;ulink linkID="2091640" linkType="Reference"&gt;2091640&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2019, three-year  data were reported showing continued  durability of treatment effect with  a responder rate of 83%. At three years on treatment patients'  motor and language scores were an average of  3.8 points greater than the scores observed for the natural history cohort of CLN2 disease. At that time, 21 of 23 patients enrolled in the extension study were continuing in the extension; the discontinuation of two patients  was not due to adverse events [&lt;ulink linkID="2117668" linkType="Reference"&gt;2117668&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later that month, further three year data were presented at the 15th Annual Lysosomal Disease Network WORLD Symposium in Orlando, FL. The rate of decline in Motor and Language domains scores (mean: 0.20 points/48 weeks, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) was significantly reduced in cerliponase alfa-treated subjects compared to the rate of decline in untreated patients (2 points/48 weeks) and improved since prior analysis at 48 weeks (0.4 points/48 weeks). Serious adverse events of hypersensitivity and device-related infections were reported in 83% subjects [&lt;ulink linkID="2118979" linkType="Reference"&gt;2118979&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;In April 2013, BioMarin submitted a clinical trial application (CTA) with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK [&lt;ulink linkID="1398130" linkType="Reference"&gt;1398130&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2013, the single-group, open-label, dose-escalation, 48-week, phase I/II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="147413" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01907087&lt;/ulink&gt;; 190-201) was initiated in the US, Germany, Italy and the UK to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of intracerebroventricular cerliponase alfa in patients ( n= 24) with CLN2 disease. The primary endpoints were to evaluate the safety of every other week infusions of cerliponase alfa based on measures such as vital signs, physical examination and ECG tests, and to  evaluate the efficacy of every other week infusions of cerliponase alfa by monitoring changes in clinical measures as measured by the NCL-2 disease rating scale [&lt;ulink linkID="1464860" linkType="Reference"&gt;1464860&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2015, interim data were reported showing that cerliponase alfa appeared to stabilize the disease, with six of the nine patients showing no net change in CLN2 rating score and the other three showing a one point decline  [&lt;ulink linkID="1626072" linkType="Reference"&gt;1626072&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Also in January 2015, it was announced that the trial was fully enrolled with 24 patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1626437" linkType="Reference"&gt;1626437&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2015, the study was complete [&lt;ulink linkID="1464860" linkType="Reference"&gt;1464860&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2016, data were presented at the 12th Annual WORLDSymposium 2016. An 80% reduction in clinical disease progression in one year compared to natural history was observed (the primary efficacy endpoint). The drug was generally safe and well-tolerated in 24 patients and resulted in disease stabilization in 65%  of patients treated over a 48-week period. At that time, additional analysis were expected to be presented at the international Child Neurology Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in May, 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1739909" linkType="Reference"&gt;1739909&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In June 2016, further clinical data were presented at the 13th EILAT Conference on New Antieplieptic Drugs and Devices in Madrid, Spain. In 21 evaluable subjects, mean /median rate of decline in CLN2 score was 0.43/0.0 units; while in 41 natural history patients, rate of decline in CLN2 score was 2.09/1.87 units per 48 weeks. Overall, enzyme replacement therapy with intracerebroventricular-administered cerliponase alfa is well-tolerated and slowed the progression of functional decline. [&lt;ulink linkID="1779516" linkType="Reference"&gt;1779514&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2016, additional data from the trial were reported.   Patients treated with cerliponase alfa continued to have motor-language (ML) scores after 81 weeks of treatment. The Hamburg Motor + Language CLN2 scores of a majority of treated patients were stable. The estimated rate of decline including approximately eight months of additional data continued to show substantial attenuation of disease progression with cerliponase alfa treatment. The Motor Language score   rate was improved from the corresponding rate of decline reported in the original BLA of 0.48 (0.16, 0.81), which was based on 48 weeks of treatment  [&lt;ulink linkID="1794460" linkType="Reference"&gt;1794460&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2016, results from the trial presented at the 2016 Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) Annual Meeting in Rome, Italy. A total of 96% subjects reported adverse events (AEs) which were assessed as study drug-related. Majority of the AEs were grade 1 to 2 and included pyrexia, hypersensitivity, seizure and epilepsy reported by 46, 38, 38 and 17% of patients, respectively. A total of 33% of patients reported serious AEs which were assessed by the investigator as study drug-related [&lt;ulink linkID="1894733" linkType="Reference"&gt;1894733&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2017, results were presented at the 13th Annual WORLD Symposium San Diego, CA. In patients (n = 24) treated with cerliponase alfa, anti-drug antibody (ADA) production was induced in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of 79 and 21% of patients, respectively. Despite a significantly higher drug exposure in the CSF, the extent of the ADA response was different between these two compartments, with the peak response being approximately 100 times lesser in magnitude in the CSF when compared with that observed in the serum   [&lt;ulink linkID="1900573" linkType="Reference"&gt;1900573&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1901623" linkType="Reference"&gt;1901623&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2018, in vivo data were presented at 2018 ARVO Meeting in Honolulu, HI.
