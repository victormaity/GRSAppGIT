the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic acid (Ocaliva; INT-747; UPF-747; 6ECDCA; OCA; DSP-1747).  The product is marketed in Europe by licensee &lt;ulink linkID="1008173" linkType="Company"&gt;AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt;.  Obeticholic acid is indicated in the US and EU for the  treatment of   primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA [&lt;ulink linkID="1766977" linkType="Reference"&gt;1766977&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1885370" linkType="Reference"&gt;1885370&lt;/ulink&gt;].    &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2016, the drug was launched in the US for PBC, following accelerated approval  [&lt;ulink linkID="1766948" linkType="Reference"&gt;1766948&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1768238" linkType="Reference"&gt;1768238&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1777891" linkType="Reference"&gt;1777891&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2017, launch began in Europe [&lt;ulink linkID="1903018" linkType="Reference"&gt;1903018&lt;/ulink&gt;]; by October 2018, the product was available in several countries in Europe [&lt;ulink linkID="2079901" linkType="Reference"&gt;2079901&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2014, former licensee Sumitomo Dainippon was planning to initiate a phase II trial for PBC in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="1607181" linkType="Reference"&gt;1607181&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, in February 2018, Sumitomo stated that following consideration of the development plan, it decided not to continue development in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="2005957" linkType="Reference"&gt;2005957&lt;/ulink&gt;].     &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Development in other chronic liver disease settings, including  primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),  biliary atresia, and alcoholic hepatitis is ongoing. In September 2015, a global, pivotal phase III trial (REGENERATE) in NASH patients with advanced liver fibrosis was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="1698509" linkType="Reference"&gt;1698509&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1698775" linkType="Reference"&gt;1698775&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in February 2019, positive topline data were reported; at that time,  filings for the US and the EU were planned in  2H19 [&lt;ulink linkID="2120966" linkType="Reference"&gt;2120966&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2014, a phase II trial began in alcoholic hepatitis; in June 2018, the study was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1591914" linkType="Reference"&gt;1591914&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In December 2014,  a phase II trial (AESOP) in  PSC was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="1626052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1626052&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in July 2017, positive top-line data were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="1949527" linkType="Reference"&gt;1949527&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2018, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1626052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1626052&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2015, the company initiated a phase II trial for pediatric biliary atresia [&lt;ulink linkID="1711588" linkType="Reference"&gt;1711588&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1739099" linkType="Reference"&gt;1739099&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in February 2018, phase II development in biliary atresia was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="2011190" linkType="Reference"&gt;2011190&lt;/ulink&gt;].  By October 2012, a phase II trial for NASH was underway in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="1336019" linkType="Reference"&gt;1336019&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in October 2015, positive data were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="1707352" linkType="Reference"&gt;1707352&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2019, NDA and EMA filings for NASH were expected in  3Q19 and 4Q19, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2149590" linkType="Reference"&gt;2149590&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Previously, the compound was previously being investigated  for other indications. The University of Perugia  was previously investigating the drug for the potential treatment of cholestasis [&lt;ulink linkID="456394" linkType="reference"&gt;456394&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By June 2010, Intercept was also investigating a series of preclinical backup and follow-on FXR compounds,  including other bile acid derived  and synthetic small molecule compounds, which were   being optimized [&lt;ulink linkID="1108952" linkType="Reference"&gt;1108952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By August 2012, an open-label,  phase IIa  (PESTO) trial was ongoing to  evaluate the ability of the drug  to reduce hepatic portal venous pressure in patients with end-stage liver disease [&lt;ulink linkID="1314893" linkType="Reference"&gt;1314893&lt;/ulink&gt;]; by January 2014, the trial had been completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1514584" linkType="Reference"&gt;1514584&lt;/ulink&gt;]; no further development has since been reported. In  July 2012,  a phase IIa trial for bile acid diarrhea (BAD) was initiated  [&lt;ulink linkID="1314896" linkType="Reference"&gt;1314896&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1314893" linkType="Reference"&gt;1314893&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in May 2014, data were presented [&lt;ulink linkID="1550434" linkType="Reference"&gt;1550434&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no further development was reported.    &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><PatentsAndGenerics><displayLabel>Patents and Generics</displayLabel><value>&lt;PatentsAndGenerics&gt;&lt;para&gt;The constraining product patent &lt;ulink linkID="PA163925" linkType="Patent"&gt;WO-02072598&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkID="PA7642949" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-08969330&lt;/ulink&gt;) expires in the US in February 2022 [&lt;ulink linkID="1641898" linkType="Reference"&gt;1641898&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2015, Intercept owned seven US patents, seven pending US patent applications, plus the corresponding foreign patents and patent applications; foreign patents had been granted in 31 European countries, Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Japan and Macao. In January 2016, Intercept was granted  additional composition of matter patents that expire in 2022 at the soonest and 2033 at the latest; in the US the patent could be extended by a further five years under the Hatch-Waxman Act. In February 2016, Intercept stated that  it had  patent coverage for the drug through to 2033 [&lt;ulink linkID="1739099" linkType="Reference"&gt;1739099&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In October 2017, further post-hoc analysis data from the open-label extension (OLE) were presented at the AASLD's Liver Meeting 2017 in Washington DC. Patients with presumed cirrhosis achieved significant improvement in alkaline phosphatase during the double-blind phase which was maintained in the OLE phase; and also exhibited a significant reduction in bilirubin the double-blind phase which remained stable during the OLE phase. The most common AE was pruritus. In OLE phase, sAEs were reported by one patient in 10 mg obeticholic acid treatment group (from double-blind placebo group), five patients in 5 mg obeticholic acid treatment group (from double-blind obeticholic acid group), and three patients in 10 mg obeticholic acid treatment group (from double-blind obeticholic acid group) [&lt;ulink linkID="1973056" linkType="Reference"&gt;1973056&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2017, further clinical data were presented at the 25th UEGW in Barcelona, Spain. After 12 months in the double blind phase, patients who received obeticholic acid showed significant reductions in ALP, GGT, ALT and AST when compared with patients who received placebo; and this improvement was durable through 24 months of the OLE [&lt;ulink linkID="1980538" linkType="Reference"&gt;1980538&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2018, further clinical data from open-label extension (OLE)  of 193 patients were presented at 53rd EASL International Liver Congress in Paris, France.  Days of pruritus per patient year and distribution of pruritus severity remained relatively steady from the 6 to 12 month interval of obeticholic acid treatment up to 48 months. An increase in mean visual analog scale score was observed within 3 months of initiating obeticholic acid treatment, then remained stable or reduced slightly toward baseline over 48 months [&lt;ulink linkID="2021418" linkType="Reference"&gt;2021418&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. After obeticholic acid treatment, the expressions of 161 genes were increased and 158 genes were decreased with a FDR &amp;lt; 0.05 in responders versus non-responders. The genes associated with negative regulation of mRNA splicing via the spliceosome (38-fold enrichment, p &amp;lt; 0.0002) and regulation of alternative mRNA splicing via the spliceosome (30-fold, p &amp;lt; 0.0000003) were the major up-regulated genes in the obeticholic acid-responsive patients. The genes associated with antigen processing/presentation via the MHC class I (14-fold, p &amp;lt; 0.0014), Wnt signaling developmental pathway (11-fold, p &amp;lt; 0.009), TNF-mediated signaling pathway (11-fold, p&amp;lt; 0.005), Fc receptor signaling pathway (7-fold, p &amp;lt; 0.003), and regulation of endocytosis (6-fold, p &amp;lt; 0.05) were the down-regulated genes in the obeticholic acid-responsive patients [&lt;ulink linkID="2021372" linkType="Reference"&gt;2021372&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further three-year data were presented at the same conference. Most of the patients showed reversal or stabilization of fibrosis stage. A total of four and two patients showed reversal in fibrosis by 1 and 2 stages, respectively; while two patients showed fibrosis worsening by 1 stage. All four patients with baseline cirrhosis exhibited reversal of fibrosis by at least 1 stage; three patients improved to fibrosis without cirrhosis.  A clear relationship between changes in fibrosis stage and other histological changes were not noted [&lt;ulink linkID="2021365" linkType="Reference"&gt;2021365&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, similar data were presented at the 2018 DDW in Washington DC [&lt;ulink linkID="2038998" linkType="Reference"&gt;2038998&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2018, further OLE data were presented at the 26th UEGW in Vienna, Austria. At month-36 in placebo, obeticholic acid 5 to 10 mg, and obeticholic 10 mg groups, the mean change from baseline in ALP was -113, -101 and -85 U/l, respectively (all p&amp;lt; 0.0001); and in total bilirubin was 0.5, -0.5 and -0.9 micromol/l, respectively. Similar durable improvements were observed for GGT, ALT, and AST [&lt;ulink linkID="2090308" linkType="Reference"&gt;2090308&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2019, further results were presented at the 2019 DDW in San Diego, CA. Obeticholic acid had a durable anti-inflammatory effect in patients with primary biliary cholangitis. During the OLE, most markers were reduced with obeticholic acid, suggesting a slow and/or control of disease progression. Long-term treatment with obeticholic acid reduced the levels of key markers of apoptosis and inflammation (TNF-alpha and hs-CRP). At all time points during the OLE, sustained reductions in IgM was observed. There was consistent increase in FGF-19 levels with obeticholic acid treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="2150775" linkType="Reference"&gt;2150775&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. The collagen area ratio (CAR), collagen fiber density (CFD), collagen reticulation index (CRI) and fibrosis composite score (FCS) increased in parallel with the Nakanuma fibrosis score in the all biopsy population (n = 30). Significant reductions from baseline in the median CAR (-2.1; p = 0.013), CFD (-0.8; p = 0.021), CRI (-0.1; p = 0.008) and FCS (-1; p = 0.002) were observed following obeticholic acid treatment, with these decreases representing -31, -35, -7 and -25% percent change from baseline in CAR, CFD, CRI and FCS, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2150731" linkType="Reference"&gt;2150731&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In November 2014, clinical data were presented from a 12 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term extension, phase II study in 27 patients at The Liver Meeting 2014 in Boston, MA.								During four-year treatment, pruritis, arthralgia, fatigue and nausea were some of the adverse events occurred in &amp;gt; 20% of patients. At four-year follow up, obeticholic acid monotherapy significantly decreased alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin [&lt;ulink linkID="1604913" linkType="Reference"&gt;1604913&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1610217" linkType="Reference"&gt;1610217&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2014, Sumitomo Dainippon was planning to initiate a phase II trial for PBC in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="1607181" linkType="Reference"&gt;1607181&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Other Studies&lt;/subtitle&gt;In April 2018, real-world clinical data from an observational study (TARGET-PBC) were presented at 53rd EASL International Liver Congress in Paris, France. Patients from US (n = 63) received obeticholic acid (5 or 10 mg daily and biw and 5 mg, qod). In overall, liver cirrhosis and non-liver cirrhosis patients, the  mean change in alkaline phosphatase was - 21.5, - 22.7 and -20%; ALT was - 18.8, - 26.3 and - 8.16%; AST was - 14.5, - 21 and - 5.62%; total billirubin was 4.29, - 4.12 and 15.77%; platelets was - 6.3, - 12.5 and 2.2%; albumin was - 3.59, - 5.37 and - 1.04%; creatinine was 10.05, 17.73 and - 1.05% and  international normalized ratio was 6.65, 8.18 and 3.02%, respectively.  Majority of patients had normal billirubin prior to obeticholic acid start and remained essentially unchanged during treatment  [&lt;ulink linkID="2021295" linkType="Reference"&gt;2021295&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Alcoholic hepatitis&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In November 2014, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel assigned, safety and efficacy, phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="167954" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02039219&lt;/ulink&gt;; TREAT 002, 1U01AA021840-01, U01AA021883, U01AA021891, U01AA021788) of obeticholic acid in patients (expected n = 60) with alcoholic hepatitis began in the US.

The subjects were to receive obeticholic acid (10, 25 or 50 mg), or placebo, for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was to assess the effects of obeticholic acid on alkaline phosphatase levels and safety. The  Secondary endpoints  was to assess the effects of drug on hepatocellular injury and liver function, disease-specific and general health symptoms and biomarkers of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. The Plasma trough concentrations of obeticholic acid would also be assessed.

The  primary endpoint was HVPG, which was previously used in the proof-of-concept PESTO study [&lt;ulink linkID="1737242" linkType="Reference"&gt;1737242&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2017, the trial was expected to begin later that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1903018" linkType="Reference"&gt;1903018&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2017, the trial was expected to begin in 2H 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1924489" linkType="Reference"&gt;1924489&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2015, the company was planning to initiate a clinical trial  investigating the lipid metabolic effects of obeticholic acid and cholesterol management effects of concomitant statin administration in NASH patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1625896" linkType="Reference"&gt;1625896&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2015, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study (&lt;ulink linkID="248803" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02633956&lt;/ulink&gt;; 747-209; CONTROL) of obeticholic acid in combination with statin therapy was initiated in the US in patients (expected n = 80) with NASH who were naive to statin therapy or have undergone a statin washout. A 16-week, double-blind phase followed by an optional two-year, long-term, safety, extension phase was also included in the trial. The primary endpoint was the effect of obeticholic acid on LDL metabolism and the ability of &lt;ulink linkID="2807" linkType="Drug"&gt;atorvastatin&lt;/ulink&gt; to modulate that effect measured by a change from baseline in LDL metabolism, including concentration and particle size/concentration. The trial was expected to complete in August 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1719305" linkType="Reference"&gt;1719305&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1723523" linkType="Reference"&gt;1723523&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By September 2016, enrollment had been completed  [&lt;ulink linkID="1869660" linkType="Reference"&gt;1869660&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2017, a positive topline data from 84 patients showed that the trial met its primary endpoint; newly initiated treatment with atorvastatin rapidly reversed obeticholic acid-associated increases in LDL to below baseline levels [&lt;ulink linkID="1949540" linkType="Reference"&gt;1949540&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2018, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="2011190" linkType="Reference"&gt;2011190&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2018, further data on markers of liver toxicity based on evaluation of drug-induced serious hepatotoxicity were presented at the 53rd EASL International Liver Congress in Paris, France. No obeticholic acid-treated patients were in the Hy’s law quandrant (&amp;gt; 3x ULN ALT and &amp;gt; 2x ULN total bilirubin). A higher proportion of obeticholic acid-treated patients were in the normal range compared with placebo-treated patients (90.5 versus 85.7%, respectively). A total of four patients experienced hepatic AEs; none reported as serious  [&lt;ulink linkID="2021346" linkType="Reference"&gt;2021346&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2018, further safety data were presented at the 69th AASLD Liver Meeting in San Francisco, CA. Compared to F1-F3 (non-cirrhotic) patients, F4 (cirrhotic) patients demonstrated no trends for worsening ALT, AST, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase after treatment with obeticholic acid and atorvastatin. The most common AE was pruritus (consistent with previous obeticholic acid studies) that occurred in 5 F4 patients (n = 1 and 4 in obeticholic acid 10 and 25 mg groups, respectively) and 11 F1-F3 patients (n = 1, 1, 1 and 8 in placebo, obeticholic acid 5, 10 and 25 mg groups, respectively). Serious AE (including one liver-related) was experienced by four obeticholic acid -treated F4 patients; however, none were considered related to obeticholic acid or atorvastatin [&lt;ulink linkID="2092216" linkType="Reference"&gt;2092216&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further clinical data were presented at the same conference.  When compared to baseline, most (82%) but not all (18%) of obeticholic acid-treated patients had increases in LDL-cholesterol at week 4, irrespective of dose, compared to an increase in 39% of placebo-treated patients. Overall, 95, 92, 100 and 100% of patients in the placebo, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg groups had LDL-cholesterol levels at or below baseline. At all-time points with all doses, mean HDL cholesterol level remained greater at &amp;gt; 40 mg/dl [&lt;ulink linkID="2092174" linkType="Reference"&gt;2092174&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By October 2012, a 72-week, dose-ranging, phase II trial for NASH, conducted by Sumitomo Dainippon, was underway in Japan. Patients were randomized with 10, 20 or 40 mg obeticholic acid or placebo. The primary endpoint was histologic improvement defined as at least a two point improvement in NAFLD activity score (NAS) with no worsening of fibrosis.

In January 2014, enrollment was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1641898" linkType="Reference"&gt;1641898&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2015, data were reported. In the intention to treat analysis, a dose dependent increase in the percentage of obeticholic acid patients compared with placebo who achieved the primary endpoint was observed at week 72. The 40 mg of obeticholic acid dosage group achieved statistical significance on the primary endpoint compared with placebo. There was no difference in fibrosis improvement between the obeticholic acid and placebo arms. In the pre-specified completer analysis, similar dose dependent effects were observed; the percentage of patients who met the primary endpoint was 51 and 22% for the 40-mg obeticholic acid and placebo, groups, respectively    [&lt;ulink linkID="1707352" linkType="Reference"&gt;1707352&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1721698" linkType="Reference"&gt;1721698&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2010, Intercept and the &lt;ulink linkID="26334" linkType="Company"&gt;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/ulink&gt; (NIDDK) entered a CRADA to conduct a 72 week, double-blind, US multicenter study to evaluate the effects of the drug in NASH patients (n = 280). Study objectives were to assess safety and whether obeticholic acid improved disease markers [&lt;ulink linkID="1119517" linkType="Reference"&gt;1119517&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The randomized, parallel-assignment, placebo-controlled, phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="73301" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01265498&lt;/ulink&gt;; NASH-FLINT) was initiated in March 2011. The primary endpoint was no worsening in fibrosis; and a decrease in NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) of at least 2 points. At that time, the trial was expected to complete in January 2015 [&lt;ulink linkID="1178602" linkType="Reference"&gt;1178602&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1179928" linkType="Reference"&gt;1179928&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1621360" linkType="Reference"&gt;1621360&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2014, the trial was stopped early for efficacy, based on an interim analysis done by a data safety monitoring board, showing that the primary endpoint of the trial had been met. The analysis of approximately half of the 283 randomized patients demonstrated a  significant improvement (on an intention-to-treat [ITT] basis) in the primary endpoint, as compared with placebo. The patients who had not yet completed the trial and who did not have a second biopsy were treated as non-responders in the ITT analysis. The pre-defined threshold of statistical significance for stopping FLINT was p &amp;lt; 0.003 [&lt;ulink linkID="1514387" linkType="Reference"&gt;1514387&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The NIDDK confirmed that a 24-week follow up period was   commencing and all  the patients in the trial would  stop taking OCA or placebo on or before   January 20, 2014. Lipid abnormalities involving increased total cholesterol and LDL and decreased HDL were seen in OCA-treated patients compared to placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1514979" linkType="Reference"&gt;1514979&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2014, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="2011190" linkType="Reference"&gt;2011190&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2014, data were reported showing that liver scarring did not worsen in 46% of patients taking OCA, compared with 21% for placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1584756" linkType="Reference"&gt;1584756&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1585271" linkType="Reference"&gt;1585271&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In December 2014, FLINT trial datasets were transferred from NIDDK to Intercept [&lt;ulink linkID="1625896" linkType="Reference"&gt;1625896&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2016, data were reported from a subgroup analysis of patients, who were started on statin during the course of treatment, which demonstrated that standard statin therapy prevented an  increase in blood LDL levels observed when initiating obeticholic acid treatment   [&lt;ulink linkID="1737242" linkType="Reference"&gt;1737242&lt;/ulink&gt;].   In April 2015, further clinical data in 283 patients were presented at the 50th EASL Annual Meeting in Austria, Vienna. Obeticholic acid treatment resulted in significant histological improvements in NAFLD activity score, NASH resolution, fibrosis improvement, fibrosis resolution and prevention of fibrosis progression and also induced rapid but reversible LDL-cholesterol increase [&lt;ulink linkID="1653686" linkType="Reference"&gt;1653686&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1653575" linkType="Reference"&gt;1653575&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2016, further clinical data were presented at the AASLD's Liver Meeting 2016 in Boston, MA.  Rate of eGFR change per year (ml/min)  was -1.9 and -0.2 and rapid progression was 40 and 24%, respectively with obeticholic acid and placebo  [&lt;ulink linkID="1872957" linkType="Reference"&gt;1872957&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In June 2017, results from a post hoc analysis in patients with T2DM and NASH were presented at the 77th ADA Scientific Sessions in San Diego, CA. The proportion of patients who attained a &amp;gt;/= 2-point improvement in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease activity score with no worsening of fibrosis at week 72 (primary endpoint) was higher in the obeticholic acid when compared with the placebo group (57 and 21%, respectively, p &amp;lt; 0.01).

In September 2017, further clinical data were presented at 53rd Annual EASD Meeting in Lisbon, Portugal. Furthermore, treatment with obeticholic acid showed significant improvement in each NAS component and fibrosis compared with placebo. Furthermore, treatment with obeticholic acid resulted in significant improvement in each NAS component (p &amp;lt; 0.05 for ballooning, and p &amp;lt; 0.01 for steatosis and inflammation) and fibrosis (p &amp;lt; 0.05) compared with placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1959186" linkType="Reference"&gt;1959186&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In ischemia/reperfusion rats, obeticholic acid significantly lowered biliary levels of lactate dehydrogenase (p &amp;lt; 0.05), gamma-glutamyl transferase (p &amp;lt; 0.008) and glucose (p &amp;lt; 0.05) when compared with vehicle [&lt;ulink linkID="2142027" linkType="Reference"&gt;2142027&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2018, preclinical data were presented at 53rd EASL International Liver Congress in Paris, France. Combination treatment of obeticholic acid (30 mg/kg, po, qd) and GFT-505 (3 or 10 mg/kg, po, qd) induced fat-specific changes in body weight and composition, exerted additive effects to reduce steatosis, inflammation and slows fibrosis progression and also exerted additive effects on genes involved in inflammatory responses and fibrotic processes relative to monotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="2021366" linkType="Reference"&gt;2021366&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further in vivo data were presented at the same conference. Obeticholic acid treatment had no effect on maternal or fetal morphometry. Obeticholic acid significantly reduced fetal total bile acid levels, including cholic acid, deoxycholic acid and taurocholic acid but did not reduce maternal total bile acid levels and individual bile acid species. Obeticholic acid treatment during cholestasis gestation had less impact upon fetal dyslipidaemia despite an improvement in fetal hypercholanaemia but did not impact maternal dyslipidaemia [&lt;ulink linkID="2021300" linkType="Reference"&gt;2021300&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2017, preclinical data were presented at the AASLD's Liver Meeting 2017 in Washington DC. In Lep ob/ob mice, When compared to vehicle control (po, qd), obeticholic acid (10 or 30 mg/kg, po, qd) and INT-767(3 or 10 mg/kg, po, qd) significantly improved histological parameters including NAS score, fibrosis stage, collagen 1a1, galectin-3 and laminin.
