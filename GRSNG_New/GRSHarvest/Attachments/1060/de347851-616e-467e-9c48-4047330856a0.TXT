Data on two studies were presented. In the first study, eight healthy male volunteers were administered 20 to 2500 mg AZD-3409 in a random, double blind, alternate panel design. In the second study, 16 healthy male volunteers were administered 500, 1000 or 1750 mg AZD-3409 for 7 consecutive days. In this second study, two sequential cohorts of 16 healthy male volunteers were administered the same 750 or 1000 mg twice-daily dose for 6 consecutive days. On the seventh day they received a single dose. Farnesyl transferase inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMCs) increased between 1 day and 7 days of dosing.  Farnesyltransferase inhibition  by AZD-3409 was effective at twice daily doses of 750 and 1000 mg. Administration of the compound resulted in inhibition of K-ras4B farnesylation in PBMCs. Lamin-B1 inhibition was also reported. Tolerability data from this study were also reported at this meeting.  The maximum tolerated single and multiple daily dose for AZD-3409 was found to be 1750 mg, with diarrhea being the dose-limiting toxicity. Potentially drug-related adverse events, such as loose stool, flatulence and light-headedness were mild, reversible and transient. Grade 2 adverse events were rare, but grade 2 diarrhea was reported by two participants at the 2500 mg dose in the single dose study. The incidence but not the severity  of adverse events was much lower in the 1000 mg twice a day dose compared to the 1750 once-daily cohort   [&lt;ulink linkID="564203" linkType="Reference"&gt;564203&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="564222" linkType="Reference"&gt;564222&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Phase I trials in cancer patients were initiated in March 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="563036" linkType="Reference"&gt;563036&lt;/ulink&gt;]; these had been completed by September 2004   [&lt;ulink linkID="564203" linkType="Reference"&gt;564203&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="564222" linkType="Reference"&gt;564222&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Phase I trials were ongoing in July 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="615253" linkType="Reference"&gt;615253&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Phase I trials in volunteers had been initiated by July 2003  [&lt;ulink linkID="504149" linkType="reference"&gt;504149&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2005, preclinical data on AZD-3409 were presented at the 96th AACR meeting in Anaheim, CA. AZD-3409 significantly and dose-dependently inhibited the growth of urothelial carcinoma cell lines with wild-type H-ras (253J-BV and RT-112 cells; IC50 = 3 and 5 microM, respectively) and mutant H-ras (T24 and J82 cells: IC50 values of ~1 and &amp;gt; 5 microM). In T24 and RT-112 cells, AZD-3409 dose-dependently reduced the fraction of cells in S phase, and increased that in G1 phase. Also in vitro, AZD-3409 (1 microM) significantly potentiated the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on 253J-BV, RT-112, J82 and T-24 cells. In mice bearing 253J-BV and RT-112 cells xenografts, but not J82 xenografts, AZD-3409 (100 mg/kg iv bid for 10 days) significantly reduced tumor weight, compared to controls [&lt;ulink linkID="594709" linkType="Reference"&gt;594709&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2004, preclinical data were presented at the 40th ASCO meeting in New Orleans, LA. Escalating doses of AZD-3409 were tested to determine the effect on proliferation of malignant PC-3 and LNCaP, and non-malignant PNT-C2 prostate epithelial cells. The compound displayed marked anti-proliferative effects in malignant and non-malignant cells with a concentration of 50 nM producing 50% inhibition after five days. A concentration of 4 microM inhibited invasion through bone marrow endothelium towards bone marrow stroma in PC-3 cells by 50%. Pretreatment with AZD-3409 resulted in a 1000-fold decrease in invasion IC50, with inhibition occurring at 10 nM [&lt;ulink linkID="546083" linkType="reference"&gt;546083&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2003, preclinical data on AZD-3409 were presented at the 15th AACR-NCI-EORTC meeting in Boston, MA. AZD-3409 showed respective IC and EC50 values for cytotoxicity and DNA fragmentation of 19.16, and 6.81 microM (MDA-MB-231 cells), 5.69 and 4.14 microM (BT-474 cells), 3.19 and 0.39 microM (A2780 cells), 8.86 and 4.59 microM (A2780cp cells). Efficient induction of apoptosis was seen in all cell lines at sub toxic doses of AZD-3409 without effecting caspase-3, -9 or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. The compound suppressed the secretion of VEGF in both breast cancer models by up to 30% regardless of HER-2 status. There was a less consistent effect on MMP-1, -2 and -9 and FGF-2 [&lt;ulink linkID="514395" linkType="reference"&gt;514395&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, preclinical data on AZD-3409 were presented at the 94th AACR meeting in Washington, DC. The compound has Ki values of less than 1 nM against isolated farnesyltransferase (FTase), and around 8 nM against geranylgeranyl-transferase-1 using K-ras4B as substrate. AZD-3409 also has an IC50 value of 49 nM against H-ras transformed mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (Hras5) and 390 nM against LoVo human colorectal cells with mutant K-ras. Administration of 50 nM of the compound produced greater than 90% inhibition of FTase in cultured Hras5 cells and MiaPaCa human pancreatic carcinoma cells. FTase inhibition also occurred when mice bearing Hras5 tumors were administered oral AZD-3409. At a dose of 100 to 200 mg/kg, at 0, 8 and 24 h, FTase was inhibited 80% within the first 5 h, and greater than 50% 24 h after the last dose. Also, using 200 mg/kg and the same dose schedule, FTase was inhibited by 75% in CaLu-6 human lung tumor xenografts 2 h after the last dose. Growth inhibition of 50% was noted in a fast-growing Hras5 tumor growth study in nude mice. AZD-3409 (100 mg/kg bid for 10 days) administered 24 h after tumor implantation inhibited approximately 80% of FTase in tumor tissue. AZD-3409 (200mg/kg bid) also produced 60% growth inhibition of established Hras5 tumours and this was associated with 90% inhibition of FTase in tumors at the end of the study, based on inhibition of K-ras. The product had significantly lower stability in mouse plasma compared to human, and might have better activity against human prenylation enzymes, leading to tumor growth inhibition [&lt;ulink linkID="498873" linkType="reference"&gt;498873&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="496891" linkType="reference"&gt;496891&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="637149" linkType="Reference"&gt;637149&lt;/ulink&gt;].
