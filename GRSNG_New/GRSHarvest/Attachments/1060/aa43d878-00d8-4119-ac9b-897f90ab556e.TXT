In December 2000, phase II studies were planned [&lt;ulink linkID="392452" linkType="reference"&gt;392452&lt;/ulink&gt;], and in July 2002, EntreMed began a phase II trial for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [&lt;ulink linkID="458294" linkType="reference"&gt;458294&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2002 and July 2003, EntreMed reported that, in a bid to reduce cash used in operating activities, it would maintain ongoing trials with Angiostatin and &lt;ulink linkID="14128" linkType="Drug"&gt;Endostatin&lt;/ulink&gt;, but would not initiate new trials with these proteins [&lt;ulink linkID="470209" linkType="reference"&gt;470209&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="496231" linkType="reference"&gt;496231&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2004, EntreMed outlicensed both drugs to Alchemgen and CMCC. At that time, clinical trials were ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="521041" linkType="reference"&gt;521041&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, by November 2009, Alchemgen was no longer trading [&lt;ulink linkID="1065249" linkType="Reference"&gt;1065249&lt;/ulink&gt;]  and no further development had been reported by CMCC for some time. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; Angiostatin was previously being developed as part of a collaboration between EntreMed and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS); however, in February 1999, BMS returned all development rights to EntreMed [&lt;ulink linkID="314370" linkType="reference"&gt;314370&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2004, EntreMed also terminated its involvement in the program, licensing the peptide to Alchemgen for Asian development, and CMCC for the rest of the world [&lt;ulink linkID="521041" linkType="reference"&gt;521041&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;NON-SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER&lt;/subtitle&gt;In July 2002, EntreMed began a randomized phase II trial in advanced NSCLC patients of Angiostatin self-injected sc bid in combination with paclitaxel and &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt;, administered every 3 weeks via iv bolus for up to 18 weeks. The trial was to evaluate tumor response, safety and pharmacokinetics of a low and high dose of Angiostatin with the chemotherapy agents [&lt;ulink linkID="458294" linkType="reference"&gt;458294&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2004, phase II data were presented at the 40th ASCO meeting in New Orleans, LA. Patients (n = 24) received paclitaxel (175 mg/m2, iv) and &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; (AUC = 5, iv) on day 1 of a 21 day cycle, plus Angiostatin at 15 mg (n = 13) or 60 mg (n = 11), sc, twice daily. A median of 4 cycles of chemotherapy was given and the median duration of Angiostatin was 125 days. Partial response rates and stable disease rates were both 39.1%. Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia, fatigue and dyspnea and a grade 1/3 skin rash occurred in 91.6% of patients [&lt;ulink linkID="540904" linkType="reference"&gt;540904&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;EARLY-PHASE CANCER TRIALS&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2002, an update of a phase I trial in patients with advanced cancer was presented at the 38th ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. Three groups of eight patients received 7.5, 15 or 30 mg/m2/day of Angiostatin by two sc injections per day for 28 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day washout period. In the absence of toxicity or 100% increase in tumor size, treatment was continued without interruption. The MTD was not reached. All doses were well tolerated after prolonged use, 18 months in the case of lung, mesothelioma and non-seminima testis patients. Serum pharmacokinetic parameters, such as AUC (0 to 12 h), had linear relationships, and Cmax was reached after 2 h. Dose-independent parameters were a half-life of 3.68 h, a Cl of 0.76 l/h/m2, and a Vd of 3.88 l/m2. Stable disease (&amp;gt; 5 months) was observed in 11 patients and of the original 24 patients, eight were still participating in May 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="452180" linkType="reference"&gt;452180&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="451994" linkType="reference"&gt;451994&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Also presented at the 38th ASCO meeting were phase I results of Angiostatin in combination with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Patients received Angiostatin iv 5 times a week, in one of three doses (15, 60 or 240 mg/m2/day), 30 min prior to EBRT for a minimum of 25 fractions. Of the 16 evaluable patients, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, with only one grade III hematological adverse event. Thirteen patients with evaluable tumors achieved a partial response [&lt;ulink linkID="452518" linkType="reference"&gt;452518&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="451771" linkType="reference"&gt;451771&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2000, EntreMed also initiated a phase I, single center, open label, dose escalation study of Angiostatin administered by sc injection in the Netherlands. At this time, four cancer patients with progressive disease had received Angiostatin through twice daily sc injections to assess the safety of this route of injection. The study was expected to include a total of 24 patients divided as three groups of eight patients per group [&lt;ulink linkID="393587" linkType="reference"&gt;393587&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By November 2000, no serious drug-related adverse events were reported in the phase I studies underway [&lt;ulink linkID="392452" linkType="reference"&gt;392452&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2001, EntreMed released phase I findings from the study of Angiostatin involving 24 patients (detailed above), including 13 with lung cancer, five with colon cancer and three with ovarian cancer at the AACR-&lt;ulink linkID="20519" linkType="Company"&gt;NCI&lt;/ulink&gt;-&lt;ulink linkID="23119" linkType="Company"&gt;EORTC&lt;/ulink&gt; meeting, Miami Beach, FL. From this study, 16 participants remained on the drug for over 5 months and four were continuing on Angiostatin as of October 2001, bringing the total time on the drug to over 1 year. Angiostatin was dispensed in prefilled syringes twice weekly to patients to self-inject at home for an initial 28-consecutive-day treatment period, followed by a 7-day observation period with additional uninterrupted 28-day cycles. Results from this study indicated that Angiostatin was able to stabilize the disease, long-term, with no dose limiting toxicity and no cumulative side effects [&lt;ulink linkID="427446" linkType="reference"&gt;427446&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="429869" linkType="reference"&gt;429869&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At this conference, EntreMed also presented data on a phase I trial of Angiostatin in combination with radiation therapy. Patients in this study, who received infusions of 15 and/or 60 mg/m2 of Angiostatin iv five times weekly, just prior to radiotherapy during a 5- to 7-week treatment period, demonstrated partial responses to the Angiostatin-radiation combination treatment. While the total dose of radiation was determined by the patient's tumor type and location, it did not exceed 72 Gy. The 10 patients that were analyzed had advanced cancers, including cancers of the head and neck, prostate, breast and lung. Six patients had received chemotherapy prior to entering the study. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed from the combination in the treatment of advanced cancers and no added toxicity was observed in normal tissue within the radiation portal [&lt;ulink linkID="427569" linkType="reference"&gt;427569&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="430123" linkType="reference"&gt;430123&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2001, data on Angiostatin were presented at the 37th ASCO meeting in San Francisco, CA. In this single-center, open-label, dose-escalation study, 19 patients were treated who had advanced cancer and had failed prior treatment. Doses were escalated from 15 to 240 mg/m2. No serious adverse events were reported or dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Of the 19 patients treated, 14 underwent surgical procedures, including tumor biopsies, without complication. The pharmacokinetic profile of Angiostatin proved to be linear and predictable, with a systemic alpha half-life of 20 min and a beta half-life of 3.52 h. Antibodies were formed to IgG and IgM in nine and six patients, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="408853" linkType="reference"&gt;408853&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="408849" linkType="reference"&gt;408849&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="409613" linkType="reference"&gt;409613&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="411389" linkType="reference"&gt;411389&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="411418" linkType="reference"&gt;411418&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2000, EntreMed started a phase I trial of Angiostatin (15, 60 or 240 mg/m2/day), in combination with radiation therapy, administered simultaneously to patients with advanced cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="373456" linkType="reference"&gt;373456&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="375132" linkType="reference"&gt;375132&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Another phase I trial was to examine Angiostatin alone at five doses ranging between 15 to 240 mg/m2/day, administered via iv infusion for 28 days. The kringle 1 to 3 form of Angiostatin was used in these trials [&lt;ulink linkID="388236" linkType="reference"&gt;388236&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;EntreMed filed an IND application for Angiostatin at the end of 1999, and received permission to initiate phase I trials from the FDA in January 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="322266" linkType="reference"&gt;322266&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="353973" linkType="reference"&gt;353973&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The first patient was dosed in the phase I trial in April 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="362609" linkType="reference"&gt;362609&lt;/ulink&gt;]; several phase I studies have been completed [&lt;ulink linkID="392452" linkType="reference"&gt;392452&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="408853" linkType="reference"&gt;408853&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><PatentsAndGenerics><displayLabel>Patents and Generics</displayLabel><value>&lt;PatentsAndGenerics&gt;&lt;para&gt;EntreMed has filed US patent applications covering Angiostatin, DNA coding for angiostatin and the use of angiostatin as a therapeutic and diagnostic agent [&lt;ulink linkID="240063" linkType="reference"&gt;240063&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The USPTO has issued a composition of matter patent directed to the angiostatin protein, for the treatment of angiogenic-mediated diseases. The patent is owned by &lt;ulink linkID="24839" linkType="Company"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/ulink&gt; Children's Hospital in Boston, and is exclusively licensed to EntreMed [&lt;ulink linkID="250631" linkType="reference"&gt;250631&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A number of patent claims cover the discovery and use of angiostatin [&lt;ulink linkID="286255" linkType="reference"&gt;286255&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="286252" linkType="reference"&gt;286252&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="286249" linkType="reference"&gt;286249&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The USPTO issued US-05792845 to EntreMed in August 1998, covering the gene used to produce the angiostatin protein, and also angiostatin vectors that may be used in gene therapy. The patent application directed to angiostatin protein fragments and aggregates has also been allowed [&lt;ulink linkID="296421" linkType="reference"&gt;296421&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2000, EntreMed was issued US-06025688 which covers all anti-angiogenic fragments and methods of production for the angiostatin protein. The patent also covers anti-angiogenic fragments of angiostatin protein that may contain amino acid additions or deletions of substitutions, so any product related to the parent molecule is now covered by EntreMed's intellectual property [&lt;ulink linkID="356936" linkType="reference"&gt;356936&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2000, &lt;ulink linkID="13601" linkType="Company"&gt;Abbott Laboratories&lt;/ulink&gt; filed a lawsuit against Children's Hospital Boston relating to the determination of the inventorship of the antiangiogenic activity of the kringle 5 region of the plasminogen molecule, however, the lawsuit is unrelated to EntreMed's rhuAngiostatin and the company stated that it does not believe this action will have any impact on the compound's development [&lt;ulink linkID="369413" linkType="reference"&gt;369413&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2000, EntreMed filed its answer and counterclaims to the lawsuit filed by Abbott, which denies Abbott any claim to inventorship of kringle 5 [&lt;ulink linkID="375132" linkType="reference"&gt;375132&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/PatentsAndGenerics&gt;</value></PatentsAndGenerics><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, preclinical data on Angiostatin in combination were presented at the 94th AACR meeting, Washington, DC. In an orthotopic model of murine lung cancer, treatment with Angiostatin (7.5 mg/m(2) sc bid) inhibited the growth of pulmonary metastases by 42%. Under similar experimental conditions, mice were administered paclitaxel (36 mg/kg iv every 4 days) or &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt;  (50 mg/kg ip) alone or together in combination with Angiostatin. Increased antitumor activity was observed with the combination treatment strategy of Angiostatin, paclitaxel, and &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkID="497082" linkType="reference"&gt;497082&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2002, preclinical data on Angiostatin were presented at the 93rd AACR meeting in San Francisco, CA. A combined treatment of cyclophosphamide (CPA) and Angiostatin was investigated in C57Bl/6 mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma tumors. Mice were treated with either CPA (mean primary tumor volume reduced by 61% compared with PBS), Angiostatin (causing a 12% decrease in mean tumor volume), or a combination, which reduced tumor volume by 5% compared with CPA alone. Angiostatin, therefore, did not enhance the antitumor effects of CPA; however, the number of metastases in the combined treatment group was 83% lower than that in the CPA group [&lt;ulink linkID="448575" linkType="reference"&gt;448575&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Another study showed a lack of efficacy of Angiostatin-based antiangiogenic therapy in a xenograft neuroblastoma model despite a long-term continuous exposure to stabilized kringle 1-3 angiostatin [&lt;ulink linkID="445465" linkType="reference"&gt;445465&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A further study demonstrated that Angiostatin potently inhibited angiogenesis induced by IL-8, MIP-2 and GROalpha in vivo. Consistent with in vitro observations, two forms of Angiostatin (kringles 1-4 and 1-3) were active, while whole plasminogen had little effect. Angiostatin-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo was accompanied by a reduction in the number of leukocytes recruited into the gels [&lt;ulink linkID="446698" linkType="reference"&gt;446698&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2001, preclinical data on Angiostatin were presented at the 18th ISTH meeting in Paris, France. It was found that in the absence of Angiostatin, plasminogen type II stimulates 2 to 3-fold the invasive activity of 1-LN human prostate tumor cells. Angiostatin effectively blocked the plasminogen-enhanced cellular invasion, reducing invasiveness to baseline levels. It was also demonstrated that Angiostatin inhibits expression of metalloproteinase 9, which is required for proteolysis of type IV collagen [&lt;ulink linkID="415844" linkType="reference"&gt;415844&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Preclinical results were also presented at the 37th ASCO meeting in May 2001. It was demonstrated that lowering the pH plays a role in the specificity of Angiostatin for tumor vasculature, and that it may therefore be possible to acidify the tumor locally in order to enhance the effects of the compound [&lt;ulink linkID="410764" linkType="reference"&gt;410764&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 1999, results of preclinical studies were presented at the 90th AACR meeting in Philadelphia, PA, which showed that recombinant angiostatin protein markedly inhibited malignant melanoma in both early- and late-stage metastatic cancer in the lungs of mice [&lt;ulink linkID="321263" linkType="reference"&gt;321263&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In vivo antitumor efficacy is improved by continuous infusion as opposed to bolus injection. Kringle 5 shows approximately 50% homology with kringles 1, 2, 3 and 4, which constitute Angiostatin. First data indicated that kringle 5 was more potent than Angiostatin in in vitro assays [&lt;ulink linkID="322004" linkType="reference"&gt;322004&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 1998, results of a murine study of Angiostatin were presented at the 89th AACR meeting in New Orleans, LA. The study highlights the efficacy of recombinant angiostatin protein and its therapeutic effects in mice with cancer. Mice were injected with melanoma cells and, after 3 days, were then treated with Angiostatin for a period of 11 days, when they were examined for cancer metastases in the lungs. The number of metastases was decreased by 60 to 80% in the treated mice [&lt;ulink linkID="282613" linkType="reference"&gt;282613&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It has also been shown to suppress the growth of primary murine tumors more potently than other angiogenesis inhibitors. In SCID mice, human primary tumors such as those of the breast, prostate and colon can also be kept in a dormant state [&lt;ulink linkID="203445" linkType="reference"&gt;203445&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The combination of Angiostatin and &lt;ulink linkID="14128" linkType="Drug"&gt;Endostatin&lt;/ulink&gt;, when used in preclinical studies to treat chemotherapy-resistant solid tumors, prevented the recurrence of the tumors even months after cessation of the combined treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="230256" linkType="reference"&gt;230256&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2001, the results of a study presented at the 92nd AACR meeting in New Orleans, LA, showed that Angiostatin appeared to impair normal tissue wound healing. Angiostatin was administered continuously by an sc implanted osmotic pump into Balb/C mice with colonic anastomoses. One week after the operation, treated mice showed more weight loss and, in contrast to control mice, 5 of 13 mice had paralytic ileus and 6 had local peritonitis. Further study data demonstrated the peptide's ability to impair tumor growth in in vitro and in vivo models of Kaposi's sarcoma [&lt;ulink linkID="404626" linkType="reference"&gt;404626&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By 2001, an angiostatin binding protein, ABP-1, expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Data suggest that this protein is involved in mediating Angiostatin inhibition of endothelial migration and tube formation [&lt;ulink linkID="405148" linkType="reference"&gt;405148&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A direct interaction could be demonstrated between angiostatin and the plasminogen receptor annexin II in a number of in vitro assays, suggesting that the latter may be the angiostatin receptor on endothelial cells [&lt;ulink linkID="405155" linkType="reference"&gt;405155&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2000, data were published demonstrating that the high sequence similarity between angiostatin protein and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) infers that angiostatin protein may have the ability to block HGF/SF c-met phosphorylation [&lt;ulink linkID="360363" linkType="reference"&gt;360363&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A recombinant form of the human angiostatin protein has been shown to dose-dependently inhibit migration (IC50 = 15 ng/ml) and tube formation of human endothelial cells [&lt;ulink linkID="360366" linkType="reference"&gt;360366&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 1997, the company published research regarding its successful production of fully active recombinant angiostatin protein. According to the scientific findings, the protein was produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris, with physical and biological properties that mimic native angiostatin derived from human plasminogen [&lt;ulink linkID="242498" linkType="reference"&gt;242498&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By virtue of its anti-angiogenic action, Angiostatin was also thought to have therapeutic potential in diseases such as diabetic retinopathy [&lt;ulink linkID="240063" linkType="reference"&gt;240063&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By 1999, the compound was under investigation for its potential on functional outcome following spinal cord injury [&lt;ulink linkID="344256" linkType="reference"&gt;344256&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no further development has been reported on these indications since 1996 and 1999, respectivley [&lt;ulink linkID="240063" linkType="reference"&gt;240063&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="344256" linkType="reference"&gt;344256&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The peptide was originally isolated from animals with tumors where it naturally inhibited the growth of secondary metastatic tumors by preventing formation of new blood vessels. Angiostatin is a product of the cleavage of plasminogen by an enzyme expressed by primary tumors. Its structure is the first four triple loop kringle domains of plasminogen [&lt;ulink linkID="231907" linkType="reference"&gt;231907&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further studies have suggested that it may also be used to reduce or eliminate primary tumors [&lt;ulink linkID="187473" linkType="reference"&gt;187473&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="185338" linkType="reference"&gt;185338&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Preclinical&gt;</value></Preclinical><AdditionalInformation><displayLabel>Additional Information</displayLabel><value>&lt;AdditionalInformation&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2004, EntreMed transferred all rights to Angiostatin and &lt;ulink linkID="14128" linkType="Drug"&gt;Endostatin&lt;/ulink&gt;  to Alchemgen Therapeutics and CMCC. Alchemgen gained exclusive rights to market both compounds in Asia, while CMCC obtained a license for the rest of the world [&lt;ulink linkID="521041" linkType="reference"&gt;521041&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2003, Oxford BioMedica entered into an agreement with EntreMed under which it received exclusive rights to Angiostatin for use in ocular diseases [&lt;ulink
