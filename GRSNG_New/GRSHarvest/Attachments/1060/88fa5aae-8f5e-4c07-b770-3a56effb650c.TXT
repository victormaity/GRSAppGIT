The randomized, open-label, parallel study (NCT00111839; EMD 72000-031) would evaluate NSCLC response to matuzumab in combination with pemetrexed (when compared to pemetrexed alone), as well as assessing the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the antibody. The study was expected to be completed by March 2007. In November 2008, the trial was underway and further information about the trial were disclosed. In the US, Austrian and German study,  155 patients received 500 mg/m2 of pemetrexed (iv) alone or in combination with 800 or 1600 mg of matuzumab. The primary endpoint was independent radiological response rate; secondary endpoints included overall survival, time to tumor progression, duration of response, safety, tolerability and quality of life. At that time, the trial was expected to be completed in April 2009 with the final data collection date for primary outcome measure set for March 2009   [&lt;ulink linkID="741659" linkType="Reference"&gt;741659&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, EMD 72000-020, a phase I study of matuzumab in combination with paclitaxel, was being carried out in patients with NSCLC [&lt;ulink linkID="499057" linkType="reference"&gt;499057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2005, data from this study were presented at the 17th AACR-NCI-EORTC conference in Philadelphia, PA [&lt;ulink linkID="636047" linkType="Reference"&gt;636047&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Gastrointestinal cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2004,  several clinical studies on matuzumab were  presented at the 40th ASCO meeting in New Orleans, LA [&lt;ulink linkID="542271" linkType="reference"&gt;542271&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="542968" linkType="reference"&gt;542968&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="543724" linkType="reference"&gt;543724&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="543782" linkType="reference"&gt;543782&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A phase I study of  matuzumab in 24 patients with EGFR-positive advanced refractory gastrointestinal tumors assessed a schedule in which the drug was delivered as an 1-h intravenous infusion at doses between 100 to 800 mg weekly for 4 weeks followed by treatment with 400 mg/week until disease progression. AUC and Cmax increased in proportion to dose; AUC (0 to t) ranged from 1619 to 20,510 hmicrog/ml and Cmax ranged from 33.7 to 259.7 microg/ml for the100 and 800 mg doses, respectively. Half-life and clearance were not constant; the half-life ranged from 35.6 to 105.9 h for the 100 and 800 mg doses, respectively. Matuzumab was well tolerated without any grade 3 or 4 toxicities and in one patient who had a complete metabolic response as assessed by PET-CT, disease stabilization was noted for 13 months [&lt;ulink linkID="542968" linkType="reference"&gt;542968&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A third phase I study presented at the 40th ASCO meeting in New Orleans, LA was designed to determine the optimal biological dose (OBD) for 3 weekly dosing. The study enrolled 51 patients with EGFR positive tumors; patients were administered matuzumab at 400, 800 and 1600 mg every 3 weeks and tumor and skin biopsies were performed at 24 h and 43 days post-treatment. Skin samples from 22 patients had been analyzed and decreases in Ki67, pMAPK and pEGFR were seen, along with an increase in p21. pEGFR and pMAPK demonstrated a dose dependent incremental inhibition and near complete signalling suppression at a dose of 1200 mg. Of 39 patients with colon cancer, 3 achieved a partial response and 4 had prolonged stable disease. Grade 1 and 2 toxicity was observed in 43% and 35% of patients, respectively. At that time, the data suggested that the OBD would be close to 1200 mg every 3 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="542271" linkType="reference"&gt;542271&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Head and neck cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2004,  at  the 40th ASCO meeting in New Orleans, LA, a study examining the uptake of matuzumab into tumors of patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer was presented [&lt;ulink linkID="543724" linkType="reference"&gt;543724&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The study assessed saturation status of  the EGFR after a single 200-mg dose of matuzumab . Matuzumab was radiolabelled with 123[I] and 2 mg was administered either simultaneously (n = 10) or 24 h after (n = 5) infusion of 198 mg of unlabeled antibody. Pharmacokinetics were similar to those these in other studies. There was at least 1.5-fold accumulation of matuzumab in tumor tissue compared with surrounding tumor-free tissue; however, the 200-mg dose was not sufficient to fully saturate the EGFRs within the tumors. The radiolabelled antibody was well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="543724" linkType="reference"&gt;543724&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Ovarian cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;By February 2003, EMD 72000-030, an open-label phase I/II monotherapy trial, was to recruit 40 recurrent platinum-refractory ovarian cancer patients in the US [&lt;ulink linkID="479208" linkType="reference"&gt;479208&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2004, it had enrolled 34 of 40 US patients [&lt;ulink linkID="523312" linkType="reference"&gt;523312&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Cervical cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;By January 2003, the phase II EMD 72000-023 study, evaluating matuzumab monotherapy, had enrolled 16 of 40 cervical cancer patients in the UK and Netherlands [&lt;ulink linkID="479208" linkType="reference"&gt;479208&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2004, EMD 72000-023 had enrolled 41 patients in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK and was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="523312" linkType="reference"&gt;523312&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2005, clinical data on matuzumab were presented at the 41st ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL.  In a  phase II non-randomized, multicenter study  in patients with recurrent cervical cancer, a total of 41 patients who had previously had platinum-based chemotherapy were administered weekly 1-h iv infusions of 800 mg matuzumab for a period of 6 months. Response results showed that 2 patients experienced partial responses and 7 had stable disease. The median time-to-disease progression was 7.1 weeks and serious adverse events, including upper abdominal pain, increased blood amylase and pancreatitis, were observed in one patient [&lt;ulink linkID="602580" linkType="Reference"&gt;602580&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Advanced cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;By October 2003, enrollment in the EMD 72000-026 study for advanced tumors was complete [&lt;ulink linkID="510896" linkType="Reference"&gt;510896&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2003, phase I data on matuzumab were presented at the 15th AACR-&lt;ulink linkID="20519" linkType="Company"&gt;NCI&lt;/ulink&gt;-&lt;ulink linkID="23119" linkType="Company"&gt;EORTC&lt;/ulink&gt; meeting in Boston, MA, from study EMD 72000-026, investigating different doses of matuzumab (100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/week for 4 weeks, followed by doses of 400 mg/week until disease progression) in patients with EGFR-positive, advanced tumors refractory to standard treatment. Matuzumab, administered as a 1-h iv infusion without premedication on a weekly schedule to 24 patients, was well tolerated at the dose levels tested, and no grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed (including the skin toxicities often elicited by EGF antagonist drugs). Best response by RECIST criteria included one CR and metabolic responses were seen in several patients by FDG-PET scanning. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic analyses were incomplete at this time [&lt;ulink linkID="513759" linkType="reference"&gt;513759&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By April 2003, EMD 72000-029, a planned phase I/II dose-finding monotherapy trial, was to enroll 44 advanced cancer patients in Japan. Endpoints were to include MTD, safety, response rate, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [&lt;ulink linkID="499057" linkType="reference"&gt;499057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2004, it had enrolled 7 of 24 patients [&lt;ulink linkID="523312" linkType="reference"&gt;523312&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2005, clinical data on matuzumab were presented at the 41st ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. A total of 26 Japanese patients were administered a 1-h iv infusion of matuzumab (400, 800, 1200 or 1600 mg) weekly. A dose-limiting toxicity, increased bilirubin, was observed in 1 patient at the 1600-mg dose. In terms of efficacy, there were 2 partial responses and 10 stable diseases. Pharmacokinetic data were consistent with results of  other monotherapy studies for matuzumab, with a mean t1/2 of approximately 110 h at low doses and 164 h at 1600 mg. Preliminary pharmacodynamic data  showed a weekly dose of 400 mg was sufficient to achieve the maximum effect: complete inhibition of pEGFR and pMAPK; a decrease in Ki67; and an increase in p27 in skin samples. Results provided a recommended phase II dose of 800 to 1200 mg matuzumab per week [&lt;ulink linkID="601852" linkType="Reference"&gt;601852&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pancreatic cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;In July 2003, three completed studies were undergoing final analysis. EMD 72000-016, a phase I/II trial of matuzumab in combination with &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; enrolled 35 pancreatic cancer patients in the EU. Endpoints included response, safety, pharmacokinetics, survival and quality of life. EMD 72000-017, a phase I imaging study to examine safety, pharmacokinetics and the accumulation of the drug in tumors enrolled 15 European patients with head and neck cancer. EMD 72000-018, a phase I dose escalation study with endpoints of MTD, safety and pharmacokinetics enrolled 22 EU patients with advanced cancers [&lt;ulink linkID="499057" linkType="reference"&gt;499057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By Spring 2003, phase I studies EMD 72000-020 and EMD 72000-021 were fully enrolled in Europe, with 17 patients each. EMD 72000-020 examined the combination of matuzumab and paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC. EMD 72000-021 studied the combination of matuzumab and &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; in patients with pancreatic cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="479208" linkType="reference"&gt;479208&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="499057" linkType="reference"&gt;499057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2003, preliminary data from EMD 72000-020 were presented at the 39th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL. Patients (n = 17) with advanced NSCLC were administered matuzumab (100, 200, 400 or 800 mg, 1 h infusion) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle); among 16 patients who received at least two cycles of treatment and were eligible for evaluation of response there were 1 CR, 6 PR and 5 SD. The response rate was 44%. Toxicity was moderate and the 800 mg dose did not induce any DLT. There were no grade 3 or 4 skin reactions. The most common adverse effects were acne, fever and dyspnea. The pharmacokinetic profile of matuzumab in this study was comparable to that of matuzumab alone [&lt;ulink linkID="491543" linkType="reference"&gt;491543&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2004, EMD 72000-020 had enrolled 19 patients in Germany and was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="523312" linkType="reference"&gt;523312&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2004, similar data were presented at the Fourth International Monoclonal Antibodies in Cancer congress in Colorado Springs, CO [&lt;ulink linkID="560046" linkType="Reference"&gt;560046&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 2004, a second phase I study presented at the 40th ASCO meeting in New Orleans, LA assessed a combination of matuzumab   in combination with &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="543782" linkType="reference"&gt;543782&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A total of 17 patients (16 with confirmed positive EGFR status) were divided into three groups; arm one received 400 mg of matuzumab/week, arm two received 800 mg of matuzumab every 2 weeks and arm three received 800 mg of matuzumab every week. All arms received &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; at a dose of 1000mg/m2 every week for 3 weeks with a 1 week rest. After two 4-week cycles, patients with stable or responding disease continued treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The combination with &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; did not affect the pharmacokinetics of matuzumab. From five patients receiving the 400-mg weekly dose there was one grade 3 episode of leukopenia and two grade 3 episodes of neutropenia. From four patients receiving the 800-mg fortnightly dose there was one grade 3 episode of reduced white blood cells and from eight patients receiving the 800-mg weekly dose there was one grade 3 episode of neutropenia [&lt;ulink linkID="543782" linkType="reference"&gt;543782&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By February 2003, EMD 72000-024, a phase I study of matuzumab plus standard chemotherapy (&lt;ulink linkID="13022" linkType="Drug"&gt;epirubicin&lt;/ulink&gt;, cisplatin and &lt;ulink linkID="12205" linkType="Drug"&gt;capecitabine&lt;/ulink&gt;), had enrolled 6 of 12 gastroesophageal cancer patients in the UK [&lt;ulink linkID="479208" linkType="reference"&gt;479208&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2004, this trial had enrolled 11 of 12 patients in the UK and was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="523312" linkType="reference"&gt;523312&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2005, clinical data on matuzumab were presented at the 41st ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. The primary objective of the  open-label, dose-escalating, non-randomized phase I  study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of matuzumab in three weekly sequential dose levels (400, 800 or 1200 mg)  in combination with fixed-dose epirubin (50 mg/m2) and  cisplatin (60 mg/m2) every 3 weeks, and oral capecitabine (1000 mg/m2) daily. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated a mean t1/2 of 86.6 and 109.5 h in the 400- and 800-mg cohort, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax with respect to dose.  Out of 6 patients in the 400 mg cohort, 4 had PR and 2 had SD; out of 7 patients in the 800 mg cohort, 3 had PR, 2 had SD and 2 had progressive disease; and out of 6 patients in the 1200 mg cohort, 3 had PR and 3 had SD. The combination was observed to be well tolerated at the 400- and 800-mg dose; however, lethargy may be a potential dose-limiting toxicity at the 1200-mg dose and so 6 additional patients would be enrolled at this dosage to evaluate the adverse event further [&lt;ulink linkID="601852" linkType="Reference"&gt;601852&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="602580" linkType="Reference"&gt;602580&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By February 2003, EMD 72000-026, a phase I pharmacodynamics study evaluating four doses, had enrolled 18 of 24 advanced cancer patients in Germany [&lt;ulink linkID="479208" linkType="reference"&gt;479208&lt;/ulink&gt;].

A total of 15 patients with EGFR-positive tumors of the colon, stomach, ovary, pancreas or kidney, who had received prior chemotherapy, were involved in the phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study. A 1200-mg, 1-h infusion was given once weekly, once fortnightly or once every 3 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="466294" linkType="reference"&gt;466294&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2002, data from EMD 72000-022 were also reported from the 14th &lt;ulink linkID="23119" linkType="Company"&gt;EORTC&lt;/ulink&gt;-NCI-AACR meeting in Frankfurt, Germany. Of eight evaluable colon cancer patients, there were two PR, one MR and one SD.

In October 2002, data from EMD 72000-022 were presented at the First International Symposium on Signal Transduction Modulators in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Toxicities observed were nausea, rash, pruritus, headache and diarrhea, but there were no dose-limiting toxicities. Complete inhibition of EGFR and ERK phosphorylation, a decrease in Ki67, and an increase in p27 expression, were observed in the skin biopsies after treatment with all three schedules. Tumor response was also observed irrespective of the schedule. This antibody showed a long half-life (146 to 180 h at a weekly dose of 1200 mg) [&lt;ulink linkID="466294" linkType="reference"&gt;466294&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In June 2003, further data from this trial were presented at the 39th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL. The study compared dosing weekly, every 2 weeks and every 3 weeks in 22 patients with advanced tumors. Matuzumab could be dosed with any of these schedules, allowing flexible dosing.There was no grade 3 or 4 toxicity except for a reversible grade 3 amylase elevation in one patient. Among 19 colon cancer patients there were 3 PR, 1 MR and 2 SD [&lt;ulink linkID="499057" linkType="reference"&gt;499057&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="499092" linkType="reference"&gt;499092&lt;/ulink&gt;].

The study had enrolled 22 patients with advanced progressive solid malignancies refractory to standard chemotherapy (eleven colorectal; four head and neck; two esophageal carcinomas; and five others). Matuzumab was given iv once weekly at an initial dose of 400 mg/week, escalated in 400 mg steps. Matuzumab treatment was well-tolerated and the MTD was 1600 mg/week. DLTs included headache and fever at 2000 mg. There was no grade 3 or 4 skin toxicity. There were 5 PR and  confirmed SD in 6 patients.

Overall, at this time, 14 studies were planned, initiated or completed [&lt;ulink linkID="513758" linkType="reference"&gt;513758&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Further data were reported at the 15th AACR-NCI-EORTC meeting in November 2003, giving a summary of pharmacokinetic results from five clinical studies in which patients received either single or multiple doses ranging from 50 to 2000 mg. In four studies, matuzumab was administered weekly, and in one study, every 1, 2, or 3 weeks. Data from 74 patients were taken for pharmacokinetic analysis (27 single, 47 multiple doses). Half-life increased with dose but leveled off at higher doses. At doses likely to be used in future clinical development, the half-life was longer than reported with other anti-EGFR antibodies indicating the potential for less frequent dosing. The volume of distribution was in the range of 3 to 4 l, and was independent of dose. Matuzumab exhibited a similar pharmacokinetic profile as found for other mAbs [&lt;ulink linkID="513758" linkType="reference"&gt;513758&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2007, at the 98th Annual AACR meeting in Los Angeles, CA, data were presented showing that there was no additive effect  in terms of decreasing A431 human tumor cell viability and survival when matuzumab  was combined with chemo and/or radiotherapy, cisplatin or both, while there was an additive effect when &lt;ulink linkID="10388" linkType="Drug"&gt;cetuximab&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment was combined with cisplatin or cisplatin and chemo or radiotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="780208" linkType="Reference"&gt;780208&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, preclinical data on matuzumab were presented at the 94th AACR meeting in Washington, DC. In nude mice models of various tumors (lung, gastric and pancreatic) the compound was shown to have a significant antitumor effect. matuzumab (0.5 or 0.05 mg) was injected ip; the compound was well tolerated. There was a high percentage of complete remissions in the gastric and lung cancer xenografts (83 and 87%, respectively) at the higher dose. Pancreatic tumors in the treated group were shown to be 31% of the volume of tumors in the control group [&lt;ulink linkID="498751" linkType="reference"&gt;498751&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2003, preclinical data on matuzumab were presented at the 94th AACR meeting, Washington, DC, from a study investigating this drug in combinations with &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt;. Under two treatment schedules the influence of different time points of initiation of single agent and combined treatment after tumor cell injection into nude mice, and the influence of different treatment durations were examined. Nude mice were orthotopically injected with L3.6pl pancreatic cells followed by biweekly treatment of 40 mg/kg matuzumab and 100 mg/kg &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; (either alone or in combination). Treatment was initiated at four different time-points after tumor cell injection (days 8 to 28). Dosing with matuzumab or &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; alone resulted in detectable tumor shrinkage and reduced lymph node and liver metastases; however there was an enhanced effect when dosed with both matuzumab plus &lt;ulink linkID="3199" linkType="Drug"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt;. The combined treatment was shown to significantly reduced microvessel density (CD31 staining) and proliferative index (Ki67 staining), and increase apoptosis (TUNEL assay). These effects were also observed in the matuzumab single agent groups. Overall, the effects were strongest when treatment was initiated at early time points after tumor cell injection. In a second experimental set-up, treatment was initiated at day 8 after tumor cell injection in all cases and stopped at four different time points (days 15 to 33). There was no significant difference in the average tumor weight of the groups treated for short versus longer time periods [&lt;ulink linkID="499129" linkType="reference"&gt;499129&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Further preclinical data were also presented at the 94th AACR meeting. The potential toxicity of iv infusions of matuzumab in a 12-week repeat-dose toxicity study was investigated. Matuzumab was administered by weekly 1-h infusions to cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 10, 33 and 100 mg/kg. Treatment was well tolerated in all groups. Pharmacokinetic parameters of the 10 mg/kg group corresponded with those determined in humans receiving the weekly dose of 800 mg. Systemic exposure in the 100 mg/kg group was approximately 8-fold the dose of 800 mg in humans. The toxicological profile in this study corresponded with that seen in human trials, where significant skin toxicity has not been observed to date [&lt;ulink linkID="497545" linkType="reference"&gt;497545&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2002, preclinical data on matuzumab were presented at the 93rd AACR meeting in San Francisco, CA. The effect of matuzumab on human pancreatic cancer growing orthotopically in nude rats was assessed. Rats received 40, 4, or 0.4 mg/kg matuzumab twice a week for 2 weeks. After treatment with 4 and 0.4 mg/kg matuzumab, all animals developed lymph node metastasis, this was not observed following treatment at 40 mg/kg.

A member of the erbB family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) along with erbB2/HER2, erbB3 and erbB4, EGFR is a key component of a multilayered signaling network [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="455345"&gt;455345&lt;/ulink&gt;]. EGFR signaling involves: (i) soluble ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)alpha; (ii) the extracellular ligand-binding region of the receptor; (iii) the transmembrane domain; (iv) the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (TK) domain; (v) dimerization of EGFR with itself and with other erbB receptors; and (vi) a host of downstream signal transduction cascades. The result is a simultaneous output of cellular messages via pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway leading to cell proliferation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516288"&gt;516288&lt;/ulink&gt;], and the Akt pathway resulting in resistance to apoptosis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516289"&gt;516289&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Dysregulation of EGFR signaling is exhibited by a wide variety of tumor types, with the exception of hematological malignancies [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="455014"&gt;455014&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Commonly, ligands are overproduced, often in concert with receptor overexpression [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516299"&gt;516299&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Mutations of the receptor have been shown to result in constitutive, ligand-independent TK activation, with the best-described mutation being EGFRvIII [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516301"&gt;516301&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Moreover, HER2 overexpression can affect the dimerization process by causing preferential formation of EGFR-HER2 heterodimers capable of much more potent signaling than EGFR homodimers [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="489661"&gt;489661&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Targeting ErbB receptors, in particular EGFR, for cancer therapy remains an active and competitive area for investigation. The two primary strategies that have demonstrated antitumor activity include anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="462953"&gt;462953&lt;/ulink&gt;] and small-molecule inhibitors of receptor (R)TKs [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516302"&gt;516302&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Among them, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6386"&gt;trastuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (Herceptin) and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11603"&gt;gefitinib&lt;/ulink&gt; (Iressa) have been approved by the US FDA for use in patients with breast and lung cancer, respectively. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6386"&gt;Trastuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; is a humanized mAb directed against the HER2 receptor [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516303"&gt;516303&lt;/ulink&gt;], while &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11603"&gt;gefitinib&lt;/ulink&gt; is an orally active small-molecule inhibitor of EGF RTK [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516305"&gt;516305&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Analogous to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6386"&gt;trastuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, mAbs have been raised against the extracellular domain of the human EGFR. The earliest mAbs were mouse antibodies. A major limitation of murine mAbs is the human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response, which results in severe allergic reactions, increased mAb clearance, and decreased efficacy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="462953"&gt;462953&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Genetic engineering has made it possible to chimerize these antibodies by linking the mouse variable antigen-binding (Fab) domain, composed of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) and a beta-sheet framework, to the human constant (Fc) fragment [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516359"&gt;516359&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although they are much less immunogenic, chimeric mAbs can contain up to 30% mouse sequences. A further attempt at reducing immunogenicity and improving efficacy led to the humanization of mouse Fab domains by transplanting mouse CDRs into a human framework [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516361"&gt;516361&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A number of anti-EGFR mAbs have been the subject of clinical trials. The most advanced is &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="10388"&gt;cetuximab&lt;/ulink&gt; (Erbitux; &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17193"&gt;ImClone Systems Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18101"&gt;Merck KGaA&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15065"&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co&lt;/ulink&gt;), a human-mouse chimeric mAb currently awaiting FDA approval for metastatic colon cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516363"&gt;516363&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="10388"&gt;Cetuximab&lt;/ulink&gt; was recently launched in Switzerland for use in &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2871"&gt;irinotecan&lt;/ulink&gt;-refractory colorectal cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="515543"&gt;515543&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Its murine precursor, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; (originally named mAb 425), exhibited antiproliferative effects in vitro and in vivo owing to interference with ligand-receptor interactions [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="96532"&gt;96532&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="76768"&gt;76768&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="305096"&gt;305096&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="505682"&gt;505682&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by coating the surface of tumor cells, marking them for destruction by the Fc receptor expressing immune effector cells [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="302366"&gt;302366&lt;/ulink&gt;]. As a result of the HAMA response to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt;, however, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was created for clinical development. The safety and efficacy of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; have been evaluated in several phase I/II trials, most of them conducted in Germany. Currently, a number of phase II trials are ongoing worldwide [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="479208"&gt;479208&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="499057"&gt;499057&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Subsequently, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; was humanized and reshaped by grafting mouse CDRs into a human IgG1 framework to yield &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="302366"&gt;302366&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;A431 cells have been used extensively to study the biochemical properties of human EGFRs [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516403"&gt;516403&lt;/ulink&gt;]. They exhibit one of the highest densities of EGFRs (1 x 10(6) sites/cell) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="76768"&gt;76768&lt;/ulink&gt;], the majority of which demonstrate a relatively low affinity for EGF (Kdissociation ~ 1 nM) with a minor component (1 to 3%) demonstrating a 100-fold higher affinity (Kd ~ 10 pM) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516402"&gt;516402&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It has been suggested that the high-affinity component may represent mitogenically active receptors relevant to tumor progression [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="518724"&gt;518724&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Antigen specificity and binding characteristics of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; were first defined by Murthy et al [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516402"&gt;516402&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; was specific for human EGFRs and incapable of recognizing mouse EGFRs. The EGF binding to A431 membranes was potently blocked by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt;, with 10 nM resulting in &amp;gt; 90% blockade. Of note, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; inhibited EGF binding to both low- and high-affinity receptors. While &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; inhibited EGF-triggered TK activation and mitogenesis, the antibody on its own was devoid of stimulatory effects. The binding of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; also resulted in receptor internalization and downregulation.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The potential antitumor activity of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; was investigated in vitro and in mice [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="76768"&gt;76768&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; (32 nM) was cytostatic, but not cytotoxic, to A431 cells grown in culture. Growth inhibition of A431 cells was significant, but not complete; the IC50 value was not obtained. When human effector cells (monocytes or lymphocytes) were added to mAb-treated A431 and colorectal SW948 cells, tumor cell lysis was observed. Nude mice inoculated with SW948 or A431 cells were given multiple intraperitoneal injections of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt;. Tumor growth was completely inhibited for A431, but only partially for SW948 xenografts.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Another study examined the role of EGF/TGFalpha on growth deregulation and the antiproliferative effects of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; using seven human carcinoma cell lines (colorectal, pancreatic, breast, squamous cell and bladder) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="96532"&gt;96532&lt;/ulink&gt;]. EGFR expression in these cell lines ranged from 2 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(6) sites/cell. The level of EGFR expression was not predictive of growth characteristics, response to exogenous growth factors, or response to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt;. TGFalpha binding to A431 cells was potently inhibited by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt;. The two bladder cancer cell lines were unresponsive to exogenous TGFalpha and thus unaffected by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt;. In the other five cell lines, the EGF/TGFalpha-dependent proliferation was abolished or reduced partially in a dose-dependent manner. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; was also able to produce growth inhibition in the absence of added growth factors. These effects were specific for EGF/TGFalpha with no inhibition of insulin or transferrin-induced growth stimulation.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The antiproliferative effects of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; alone and in combination with cisplatin were examined in ten squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="305096"&gt;305096&lt;/ulink&gt;]. EGFR was detected by ELISA in all ten cell lines, but the amount present varied considerably between 20 and 8100 fmol EGFR/mg protein. EGFR expression was somewhat predictive of response to mAb in that low expressors (defined in this study as &amp;lt; 170 fmol/mg) were insensitive, while high expressors were sensitive. Among high expressors, however, the level of EGFR did not correlate with the level of growth inhibition. As a single agent, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; (30 nM) produced a modest mean growth inhibition of 38%. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; plus cisplatin resulted in enhanced growth inhibition over cisplatin alone.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The potential immunological mechanism of action of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was investigated in SCCHN cell lines [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="302366"&gt;302366&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It has been demonstrated that anti-receptor antibodies can mediate ADCC by recruiting immune effector cells such as natural killer cells to antibody-coated tumor cells via the Fc-Fc receptor interaction [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="516420"&gt;516420&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Cells were exposed to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with and without &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; and assessed for evidence of mAb-mediated and primary ADCC, respectively. Increasing effector:target (E:T) ratios resulted in increased cytotoxicity, with survival fractions of 107% at a 1:1 ratio and 62% at 20:1. The addition of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; led to a significant augmentation of effector cell activity at each E:T ratio, with 94% cell survival at 1:1 ratio (p &amp;lt; 0.005) and 21% at 20:1 (p = 0.001). ADCC was proportional to exposure time. EGFR level correlated with primary PBMC cytotoxicity, but not mAb-enhanced ADCC. Of note, similar effects were seen with a rat anti-EGFR mAb, ICR-62 (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="21072"&gt;Institute of Cancer Research UK&lt;/ulink&gt;), but not with murine &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt;.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The combination of cisplatin plus either &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was tested in a nude mice model using 640 xenotransplants of human head and neck, cervical, vulvar and breast carcinomas [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="505682"&gt;505682&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Cisplatin was given at 6 mg/kg twice a day on days 1 and 7 and both mAbs were administered at 0.04 mg/kg twice a day on days 1 and 7. Combined treatment resulted in significant growth inhibition of tumors unresponsive to either cisplatin or mAb alone. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; exhibited comparable activity in combination with cisplatin.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Additional studies have been presented in conference abstracts. In a nude mice model, 0.5 mg/kg of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; resulted in significant antitumor activity including complete remission rates of 83 and 87% in gastric and lung xenografts, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="498751"&gt;498751&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Pancreatic xenografts proved to be less sensitive, with 31% reduction in tumor volume. A &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; plus &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; combination was evaluated in nude mice bearing pancreatic xenografts [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="499129"&gt;499129&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Treatment was initiated at four different time points following tumor cell injection using 40 mg/kg of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; and 100 mg/kg of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt;. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;Matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; given singly resulted in tumor shrinkage and reduced metastases, but the results were superior for the combined treatment. Significantly improved microvessel density (CD31 staining), proliferative index (Ki67 staining), and apoptosis (TUNEL assay) were observed after combined treatment as well as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; monotherapy. Results favored early onset of treatment. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics&lt;/subtitle&gt;Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were analyzed for a cohort of patients receiving a loading dose of 400 mg of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; followed by four maintenance doses of 200 mg [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="460657"&gt;460657&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Time to peak serum concentrations (Cmax) was within 1 to 3 h of the start of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; infusion. Average drug levels (Cavg) were in the range of 20 to 61 microg/ml and trough levels (Cmin) before the next infusion ranged between 7 to 38 microg/ml. The Cmin thus still exceeded the effective in vitro concentration of 5 microg/ml. The serum half-life (t1/2) exceeded 85 h and increased with dose.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;PK parameters were evaluated in another phase I study examining extended scheduling of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; infusions [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="473016"&gt;473016&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="499092"&gt;499092&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The PKs were non-linear and the t1/2 increased with multiple doses. The first two infusions of 1200 mg every 3 weeks displayed t1/2 values of 180 and 192 h [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="499092"&gt;499092&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This finding supports the feasibility of an 'every 3 weeks' administration. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Data have also been published summarizing PK results from five clinical studies in which patients received either single or multiple doses ranging from 50 to 2000 mg. In four studies &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was administered weekly, and in one study the drug was given every 1, 2 or 3 weeks. Data from 74 patients were assembled for PK analysis (27 single and 47 multiple doses). &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;Matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; exhibited a similar PK profile to other mAbs; however, t1/2 appeared to be longer compared with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="10388"&gt;cetuximab&lt;/ulink&gt;. The results clearly indicated that t1/2 and clearance are not constant; however, a dose-proportional increase was observed for Cmax and AUC. The t1/2 increased with dose, but leveled off at higher doses. This finding is indicative of a PK model with parallel elimination pathways in which one pathway is saturable. At higher doses (400 to 2000 mg), this saturable pathway did not contribute markedly to the PKs of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt;. The volume of distribution was found to be small (~ 4 l) and independent of dose [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="513758"&gt;513758&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;Cynomolgus monkeys tolerated &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment consisting of 12 weekly intravenous administration of 10, 33 or 100 mg/kg [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="497545"&gt;497545&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The only clinical toxicities consisted of emesis (in the highest dose group) and reduced activity limited to individual administrations in one animal in the 100 mg/kg group. Menstrual cycle abnormalities were noted in the 33- and 100-mg/kg groups [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="497545"&gt;497545&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;Three phase I studies of murine &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; focused on malignant gliomas. In a study of multiple infusions, no therapeutic benefit was observed at a median cumulative dose of 2.4 g [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="305098"&gt;305098&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a second study of escalating single doses, &gt;/= 100 mg was capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier to saturate &amp;gt; 70% of tumor EGFR [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="305099"&gt;305099&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A third study set out to evaluate the feasibility of intratumoral injections of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt;, but could not be completed as planned because of severe inflammatory reactions at the tumor sites [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="305097"&gt;305097&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the latter two studies, the combined incidence of HAMA was high (26 out of 38 patients).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A pair of studies evaluated &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; as potential therapies for advanced SCCHN. In the first, 12 patients were randomized to receive a single infusion of 20, 100 or 400 mg of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; prior to surgery [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="305102"&gt;305102&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Surgical specimens were immunostained for EGFR and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; to determine their distribution. In 11 out of 12 patients, 80 to 100% of the tumor cells were positive for EGFR. A dose-dependent binding of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; was demonstrated, with no binding at 20 mg and excellent, homogeneous binding at 400 mg. While the treatment was well tolerated, HAMA was detected in all eight evaluable patients. A dose-escalation study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in SCCHN followed [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="460657"&gt;460657&lt;/ulink&gt;] in which nine subjects were enrolled regardless of EGFR status. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;Matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was administered as a 1-h infusion at three different loading doses (100, 200 and 400 mg) followed by four weekly maintenance doses at half the respective loading dose. Two doses were given before and three were given following surgery. Cumulative doses of up to 1200 mg were well tolerated without dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Several phase I evaluations of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; have been reported in conference abstracts. A study of weekly dosing was undertaken in patients with EGFR-positive, chemotherapy-refractory tumors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="446711"&gt;446711&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="451858"&gt;451858&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="470751"&gt;470751&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The initial dose of 400 mg/week was escalated by 400-mg increments in cohorts of three patients. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 1.6 g/week with DLTs of severe headache and fever occurring at 2 g. Rash was common (59%) but mild. Partial tumor responses were seen in five out of 18 (28%) patients with disease stabilization in four out of 18 (22%) patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="451858"&gt;451858&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Another study compared the safety and efficacy of three infusion schedules [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="466294"&gt;466294&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="473016"&gt;473016&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="499092"&gt;499092&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The more convenient infusions (every 2 weeks and every 3 weeks) were compared with the weekly standard. Patients (n = 27) were randomly assigned to 1.2 g weekly, 1.2 g every 2 weeks, or 0.8 or 1.2 g every 3 weeks. Treatment was well tolerated without DLT. Grade 1/2 rash occurred in 93% of patients, and the incidence was similar across all three schedules. Four patients with heavily pretreated colon cancer achieved tumor shrinkage, while four additional patients (three with colon cancer and one with renal cell carcinoma) had stable disease. Tumor response occurred irrespective of infusion schedule, and thus extended dosing was demonstrated to be safe and effective, with no regimen emerging as superior. Pre- and post-therapy skin and tumor biopsies were obtained on days 0 and 43, respectively, for pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis. These skin and tumor tissues were analyzed for markers of EGFR signaling. Complete inhibition of EGFR and MAPK phosphorylation, a decrease in proliferation marker Ki67, and an increase in cell cycle inhibitor p27 expression were observed in both skin and tumors. The discovery of a good correlation between skin and tumor PD changes suggests that skin may be a valid surrogate tissue for tumor EGFR modulation. Tumor pEGFR levels and inhibition did not predict for response. An ongoing study will extend these findings by investigating 400- and 1600-mg dose levels [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="466294"&gt;466294&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="473016"&gt;473016&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="499092"&gt;499092&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase I trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in combination with paclitaxel enrolled 17 patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="491543"&gt;491543&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Tumor EGFR expression was an entry requirement and did not differ for squamous cell versus adenocarcinoma histological types. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;Matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was administered as 1-h, weekly infusions using escalating doses of 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg. Paclitaxel was given at 175 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment was well tolerated at up to 800 mg/week of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt;. Toxicity attributable to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was moderate with 11 out of 16 (65%) evaluable patients developing grades 1/2 rash. DLT did not occur. Tumor responses were observed with one out of 16 complete responses (CRs), six out of 16 partial responses (PRs) and five out of 16 with stable disease (SD). The overall response rate was an encouraging 44%. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a further phase I, randomized study investigating the PD effects of different doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in patients with EGFR-positive, advanced tumors refractory to standard treatment, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was administered as a 1-h intravenous infusion without premedication on a weekly schedule. Patients (n = 24) were randomized to receive 100, 200, 400 or 800 mg of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (absolute dose)/week for the first 4 weeks in a double-blind setting, with six patients treated at each dose level. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;Matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was then administered at a dose of 400 mg (absolute)/week for all patients until disease progression. Skin and tumor biopsies were performed for PD evaluation before treatment and in weeks 4 (skin only) and 8. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;Matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was well tolerated at the dose levels tested, and no grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed. In one patient with complete metabolic response by PET-CT, disease stabilization for 10 months was noted [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="513759"&gt;513759&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar results were published for a dose-escalation study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (400 to 2000 mg/week) to determine safety and tolerability in patients (n = 22) with advanced cancer. There were five PRs and confirmed SDs in six patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="519173"&gt;519173&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Grade 3 headache and fever were the DLT at 2000 mg/week and the MTD was established to be 1600 mg/week. Acneiform skin reaction was the most common side effect, with 50% of patients suffering from grade 1 and 14% of patients suffering from grade 2. Objective responses and disease stabilization were observed at all dose levels [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="519173"&gt;519173&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Ongoing phase I/II studies include a study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; plus &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3199"&gt;gemcitabine&lt;/ulink&gt; in pancreatic cancer, an imaging study in SCCHN, a dose-escalation study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; plus standard chemotherapy in gastroesophageal cancer, an evaluation of four different doses in advanced cancer, a study of two doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; plus standard chemotherapy in EGFR-positive tumors, and a Japanese dose-finding monotherapy trial in patients with advanced cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="499057"&gt;499057&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In a phase II study of radiolabeled &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; as an adjuvant therapy for high-grade gliomas, 180 patients were enrolled to receive &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; labeled with iodine-125 over a ten-year period. Patients had previously received surgery and external beam radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. Treatment consisted of three weekly intravenous or intra-arterial injections. The mean total dose of radio-iodinated &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3029"&gt;EMD-55900&lt;/ulink&gt; was 140 mCi. Treatment was well tolerated with only one patient, who received a single dose exceeding 60 mCi, experiencing acute toxicity and one patient developing hypothyroidism. Median overall survival times for patients with glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma were 13.4 and 50.9 months, respectively, which compared favorably with historical expectations [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="518726"&gt;518726&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Disease-specific efficacy trials ongoing at this time include a study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; monotherapy in patients with cervical cancer being conducted in the UK and the Netherlands, and another monotherapy trial in patients with recurrent platinum-refractory ovarian cancer in the US [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="479208"&gt;479208&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;DLTs of grade 3 headache and fever occurred in a cohort of patients treated with a 2000-mg weekly infusion [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="446711"&gt;446711&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="451858"&gt;451858&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="470751"&gt;470751&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Otherwise, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; has been well tolerated, with mostly grade 1 and 2 toxicities, including rash, pruritus, nausea and vomiting, headache, diarrhea and transaminitis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="451858"&gt;451858&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="466294"&gt;466294&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="473016"&gt;473016&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="491543"&gt;491543&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="499092"&gt;499092&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The predominant toxicity of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; is an acneiform skin reaction, which is in keeping with other EGFR-targeted agents and is thought to be a direct result of mechanism-based targeting of EGFR to normal skin tissues [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="519051"&gt;519051&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In one study at least , however, development of a rash did not predict for response to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="499092"&gt;499092&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Unlike small-molecule TK inhibitors, which are commonly associated with diarrhea, GI toxicity was much less apparent with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt;. No human anti-human antibodies have been reported to date. A lack of significant hematological and other major organ toxicity should facilitate combining &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; with cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Preclinical characterization of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; and its murine version has revealed a multifunctional mAb that binds specifically to human EGFR, blocks the binding of EGF and TGFalpha to EGFR and antagonizes EGF/TFGalpha-induced TK activity and mitogenesis. The mAbs also mediate tumor cell-directed, cell-mediated cytotoxicity and induce receptor endocytosis and degradation. In vitro, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3033"&gt;matuzumab&lt;/ulink&gt; produced cytostatic growth inhibition of cultured human cancer cells and can act additively in combination with cisplatin. In vivo, the antibody caused regression of human tumor xenografts in mice. Additionally, early phase I/II data support a favorable toxicity profile with mild-to-moderate skin reaction as the predominant toxicity, a long serum half-life allowing for an extended dosing schedule and promising antitumor activity for several tumor types, notably NSCLC and refractory colon cancer, especially when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The drug can feasibly be combined with paclitaxel. Clinical data on matuzumabare, however, preliminary, are appearing mostly in abstract form and are based on small numbers of patients; therefore, any efficacy data in particular should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, the clinical development of matuzumab has been centered in Europe, with just one trial currently ongoing in the US. Randomized trials have not yet been initiated for matuzumab.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;One potential advantage of matuzumab over the lead anti-EGFR mAb, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="10388"&gt;cetuximab&lt;/ulink&gt;, is that matuzumab is humanized rather than chimerized, with no reported incidence of hypersensitivity reactions or neutralizing antibodies, which may be important with long-term administration. The next generation of anti-EGFR mAbs will feature novel compounds such as bispecific antibodies that simultaneously target EGFR and immune effector cells, antibodies that bind both EGFR and mutant EGFRvIII, single-chain variable fragments (ScFv 14e-1-ETA), and toxin-mAb or cytotoxic-mAb conjugates. Important considerations such as the standardization of tests for quantification of EGFR, identification of additional prognostic and predictive factors in EGFR-expressing tumors, selection of patients most likely to benefit from target modulation, and definition of the optimal dose and schedule of administration remain to be addressed by future research. Amid the great expectations surrounding targeted therapeutics such as matuzumab, whether they will significantly alter the natural course of EGFR-expressing tumors remains to be
