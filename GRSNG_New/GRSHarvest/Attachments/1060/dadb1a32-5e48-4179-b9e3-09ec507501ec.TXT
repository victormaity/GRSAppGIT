A second patent family wholly owned by aTyr and covering the drug and related proteins encompasses further issued patents and pending patent applications, including issued &lt;ulink linkID="PA7354442" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-09127268&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkID="PA7136681" linkType="Patent"&gt;EP-2509625&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkID="PA7345022" linkType="Patent"&gt;JP-5819314&lt;/ulink&gt;, Chinese Patent  ZL 201080061989.7, and Australian patent 2010327926, as well as two other issued US patents, set to expire in 2030 and 2031 and an issued patent in Hong Kong; as of March 2018, related applications were pending in the US, Australia, Canada, Europe, China, and Japan. Patents issuing from these applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2030 plus any patent term extension. Also in March 2018, patent applications to specific methods of use of the drug and related proteins, and disease polymorphisms of HARS were pending; by March 2017, these applications had been filed in the US and in some cases under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT); if issued, these patents are anticipated to expire between 2033 and 2037 [&lt;ulink linkID="1909960" linkType="Reference"&gt;1909960&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="2015832" linkType="Reference"&gt;2015832&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/PatentsAndGenerics&gt;</value></PatentsAndGenerics><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;In January 2017, the FDA granted Fast Track designation  for LGMD2B [&lt;ulink linkID="1893358" linkType="Reference"&gt;1893358&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1892402" linkType="Reference"&gt;1892402&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The company's IND was placed on full clinical hold in 2014 to address the issue of the comparability of the drug substance used in preclinical toxicology studies to that previously used with that proposed for use in the US clinical trial. aTyr submitted a response, and in January 2015, the FDA removed the IND from full clinical hold, allowing a phase Ib/II trial in the US. The IND was again placed on partial clinical hold, which prohibited the evaluation of ATYR-1940 at doses higher than 3.0 mg/kg; the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold in December 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1892402" linkType="Reference"&gt;1892402&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2105159" linkType="Reference"&gt;2105159&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2016, the FDA granted Fast Track status for the treatment of FMD [&lt;ulink linkID="1865911" linkType="Reference"&gt;1865911&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Those patients administered placebo and low doses of ATYR-1940 (1.0 mg/kg in trial 004) showed a negative change from baseline following treatment, with those FSHD patients treated at 3.0 mg/kg in trial 002 showing a small positive effect. In comparison, in early onset FSDH (3.0 mg/kg trial 003) and LGMD patients (3.0 mg/kg biw trial 004), there was a significant improvement observed, with 50 to 78% of patients in the ATYR-1940 dose groups having increased scores [&lt;ulink linkID="1892402" linkType="Reference"&gt;1892402&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By August 2016, a long-term extension, phase Ib/II study  (&lt;ulink linkID="265953" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02836418&lt;/ulink&gt;; ATYR1940-C-006) in adult FSHD, early-onset FSHD, and LGMD2B patients from  the ongoing 003 and 004 trials was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="1787198" linkType="Reference"&gt;1787198&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In December 2016, the trial was completed and top-line data were reported. The trial was conducted in 6 clinical sites for a period of 12 weeks and patients were assigned to two treatment groups; group A with 4 patients treated for FSHD received infusions of Resolaris with the highest dosing of up to 1.0 mg/ kg biweekly for a period of 4 week; group B with 10 patients treated for LGMD and 	4 patients with FSHD received infusions of Resolaris with the highest dosing up to 3.0 mg/ kg biweekly for a period of 4 week. The patients with LGMD2B, 10 patients had overall stable INQoL score.

In December 2016, interim data were reported from the exploratory assessments of clinical activity of Resolaris in patients with early onset of FSHD at weekly doses of 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/ kg for a total of 12 weeks. The INQoL scores were relatively stable with two patients having slight decrease in disease burden and one patient showed an increase. The drug was 	tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1884662" linkType="Reference"&gt;1884662&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By March 2017, enrollment of the trial had been closed with a total of 8 patients recruited.

In January 2016,  patient dosing  was completed  [&lt;ulink linkID="1726192" linkType="Reference"&gt;1726192&lt;/ulink&gt;]; later that month, dosing was completed in third cohort of the trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1738614" linkType="Reference"&gt;1738614&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2016, results from the trial were reported. Data demonstrated that Resolaris showed overall individualized neuromuscular quality of life (INQoL) score of 2.77, -1.22 and -3.78 for 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg at 1-month compared to 4.12 for placebo, and -9.90 for 3.0 mg/kg at 3-months compared to 15.55 for placebo in the intent-to-treat population of 20 patients. Furthermore, the composite manual muscle testing score showed improvement of approximately 0.5% with Resolaris compared to 1% decline in the placebo. The drug was tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1747466" linkType="Reference"&gt;1747466&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2016, data from the FSHD-002 trial were presented at the 21st International Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society in Granada, Spain. The pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional and  consistent throughout the study. A significant improvement in Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life Assessment questionnaire responses and Manual Muscle Testing  measures, was observed. Patients in cohort 3 showed better improvement compared to cohort 1 and 2 patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1804776" linkType="Reference"&gt;1804776&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2015,
