All the nine patients who completed the study achieved onset of relief of the defining symptom within 4 h (primary endpoint). The median time from attack onset to the initiation of study drug treatment was found to be similar in the 500 and 1000 U groups (3.9 and 3.5 h, respectively) and shorter when compared to that of 1500 U group (6.4 h). Primary endpoint was met for all patients (n = 9). The median time to beginning of relief of the defining symptom was observed to be 0.5 h and the median time to complete resolution was 13.6 h. A significantly longer time to complete resolution of the attack (102.3 h) was seen in one patient with severe extremity attack in the 1500 U dose group, than that of other patients. At all dose levels, increases in Cinryze plasma antigen and functional activity from baseline were observed at 1 h and 24 h post-dose. A total of six patients had functional Cinryze levels >/= 0.7 U/ml at 1 h post-infusion. A dose-dependent correlation was observed regarding functional Cinryze activity [<ulink linkType=""Reference"" linkID=""1566912"">1566912</ulink>].

Overall, an increase was observed in C1-INH functional activity and antigen levels. In children and adults, generally similar pharmacokinetic profiles were observed for C1-INH doses. With multiple doses, C1-INH accumulation was not observed. A total of 75 to 100% of children aged 6 to 11 years achieved symptom relief from HAE attacks after treatment with C1-INH. At &lt;/= 72 h post administration of C1-INH, of 40 medical procedures, no HAE attacks were observed for 39 medical procedures. A 79 to 88% reduction in number of HAE attacks were observed in C1-INH concentrate treated children aged 6 to 11 years; and also in children aged 2 to 5 years, the results were similar. Overall, in children, treatment with iv C1-INH concentrate demonstrated an expected pharmacokinetic profile; and for acute treatment, pre-procedure prevention, and long-term prophylaxis of HAE attacks [<ulink linkType=""Reference"" linkID=""1950478"">1950478</ulink>].</para></Outcomes>",Cinryze for the Treatment of Hereditary Angioedema Attacks in Children Under the Age of 12 Years,0624-203; 2011-000369-11; NCT01095510,"<Regimens><para>A total of seven patients received <ulink linkType=""Drug"" linkID=""54366"">Cinryze</ulink> and five patients received placebo.
