The product was approved  for the treatment of type 2 diabetes not controlled  by oral antidiabetic agents and requiring insulin therapy, and for type 1 diabetes in combination with long- or intermediate-acting injectable insulin [&lt;ulink linkID="681913" linkType="Reference"&gt;681913&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in October 2007, Pfizer withdrew from its marketing agreement for Exubera [&lt;ulink linkID="840724" linkType="Reference"&gt;840724&lt;/ulink&gt;]; at that time, Nektar was evaluating its options regarding Exubera and  still believed the product to be a valuable therapeutic for diabetic patients [&lt;ulink linkID="840831" linkType="Reference"&gt;840831&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2008, following the identification of an increased occurrence of lung cancer, Nektar discontinued its inhaled insulin programs and ceased negotiations with potential partners of these programs [&lt;ulink linkID="894831" linkType="Reference"&gt;894831&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2006, the drug was approved in the EU and US for diabetes [&lt;ulink linkID="647238" linkType="Reference"&gt;647238&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="647866" linkType="Reference"&gt;647866&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Exubera was launched in Germany and Ireland in May 2006  [&lt;ulink linkID="679198" linkType="Reference"&gt;679198&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2006, Pfizer confirmed the launch of Exubera  in the US and the UK [&lt;ulink linkID="732821" linkType="Reference"&gt;732821&lt;/ulink&gt;].

A similar warning for EU product labels was recommended by the CHMP in June 2008. At that time, Pfizer had already ceased distribution of the drug in Europe and it was expected that the drug would no longer be available in the EU from September 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="917684" linkType="Reference"&gt;917684&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><PatentsAndGenerics><displayLabel>Patents and Generics</displayLabel><value>&lt;PatentsAndGenerics&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;ulink linkID="IN2698648" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-05997848&lt;/ulink&gt; was issued to Inhale Therapeutic Systems in December 1999, and corresponds to &lt;ulink linkID="IN2191396" linkType="Patent"&gt;WO-9524183&lt;/ulink&gt;, filed in February 1995.

In December 2006, the courts refused Novo Nordisk's motion for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented sales of Exubera during that time [&lt;ulink linkID="775789" linkType="Reference"&gt;775789&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In October 2002, the companies were still in discussions with regulatory agencies regarding the timing of submissions [&lt;ulink linkID="466685" linkType="reference"&gt;466685&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Pfizer stated in its January 2003 quarterly conference call that it would not file the product during 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="486355" linkType="reference"&gt;486355&lt;/ulink&gt;], following the report of small reductions in FEV (forced expiratory volume) in some phase III subjects treated with inhaled insulin [&lt;ulink linkID="436411" linkType="reference"&gt;436411&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2004, Pfizer stated that it was in the final stages of preparing an NDA for the US [&lt;ulink linkID="573518" linkType="Reference"&gt;573518&lt;/ulink&gt;], and in March 2005, the FDA accepted the NDA filing [&lt;ulink linkID="587783" linkType="Reference"&gt;587783&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2005, an FDA advisory committee recommended approval, voting seven to two for Exubera's approval, and unanimously agreeing that clinical studies had adequately addressed pulmonary safety in patients without underlying lung disease; the FDA was due to make a final decision in October 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="622224" linkType="Reference"&gt;622224&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="622230" linkType="Reference"&gt;622230&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2005, the FDA extended the review date by three months to assess the submitted chemistry data [&lt;ulink linkID="631136" linkType="Reference"&gt;631136&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2006, the FDA approved Exubera for the treatment of type 1 and  2 diabetes [&lt;ulink linkID="647238" linkType="Reference"&gt;647238&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="647440" linkType="Reference"&gt;647440&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2002, Aventis expected to file an EU submission during 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="452878" linkType="reference"&gt;452878&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2004, the EMEA accepted Pfizer and Aventis's February 2004 MAA filing [&lt;ulink linkID="526269" linkType="Reference"&gt;526269&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In the final 3 days of the study, mealtime blood sugar levels with Exubera were lower, with similar fasting blood sugar levels than Lantus, resulting in lower overall 24-h blood sugar levels. No patients experienced severe adverse events in either group. Hypoglycemia was more frequent in the Exubera group [&lt;ulink linkID="831191" linkType="Reference"&gt;831191&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2007, results from an 8-year extension study were presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, assessing lung function and blood sugar control in patients with types 1 and 2 diabetes. Patients who had completed a 3-month phase III trial received  metformin and/or sulfonylurea and/or thiazolidinediones and/or injected insulin, with or without Exubera. Average yearly reductions in lung function were similar in both groups, and Exubera provided sustained blood sugar control throughout the 8-year period [&lt;ulink linkID="831191" linkType="Reference"&gt;831191&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2007, Pfizer began an open label, uncontrolled,  52 week,   phase III trial (NCT00527397, A2171105),  of Exubera in non-smoking Japanese patients (n = 189) with type  1 and 2 diabetes. The primary outcomes  were    insulin antibody levels, change in pulmonary function  (FEV1 and FVC) and total number of adverse events. This study was ongoing in April 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="832857" linkType="Reference"&gt;832857&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By July 2001, the original phase III program had been completed [&lt;ulink linkID="417847" linkType="reference"&gt;417847&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2001, it had been decided that the NDA should include an increased level of controlled, long-term pulmonary safety data in diabetic patients and a major study was planned  [&lt;ulink linkID="434273" linkType="reference"&gt;434273&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="436411" linkType="reference"&gt;436411&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2002,  Pfizer and Aventis confirmed that they were to complete additional long-term studies [&lt;ulink linkID="466685" linkType="reference"&gt;466685&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Pfizer stated in its January 2003 quarterly conference call that it would not file the product during 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="486355" linkType="reference"&gt;486355&lt;/ulink&gt;], following the report of small reductions in forced expiratory volume  (FEV) in some phase III subjects treated with inhaled insulin [&lt;ulink linkID="436411" linkType="reference"&gt;436411&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By January 2004, phase III trials were complete [&lt;ulink linkID="519897" linkType="reference"&gt;519897&lt;/ulink&gt;]. As of February 2004, over 2000 patients had been enrolled into late-stage trials, with treatment lasting up to 5 years for some. The reductions in FEV stabilized to normal reductions related to aging [&lt;ulink linkID="521119" linkType="reference"&gt;521119&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2006, clinical data were presented at the 66th ADA scientific sessions in Washington DC. In a 2-year, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter, phase III study, Exubera was compared with sc insulin in 635 type 2 diabetics. Changes in FEV1 were &amp;lt; 1.5% from mean baseline for both groups and did not progress throughout the 2 years. HbA1c was improved from 7.7 to 7.3%, and from 7.8 to 7.3% for  Exubera and sc insulin, respectively. Exubera induced a greater weight loss and reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and severe hypoglycemic rates and side effects (with the exception of cough, which occurred with Exubera and was mild in most cases) were comparable [&lt;ulink linkID="671754" linkType="Reference"&gt;671754&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="672962" linkType="Reference"&gt;672962&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="672911" linkType="Reference"&gt;672911&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="674982" linkType="Reference"&gt;674982&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a similar phase III trial in  582 type 1 diabetics, changes in FEV1 were &amp;lt; 1 and &amp;lt; 2% from mean baseline and did not progress for up to 2 years; HbA1c changed from 7.4 to 7.5%, and from 7.5 to 7.3% for  Exubera and sc insulin, respectively. Severe hypoglycemic rates were lower with Exubera (2.8 per 100 subject-months) than with sc insulin (4.1 per 100 subject-months).  FPG declined with Exubera, and side effects (with the exception of cough, which occurred with Exubera and was mild in most cases) were comparable [&lt;ulink linkID="671764" linkType="Reference"&gt;671764&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="672962" linkType="Reference"&gt;672962&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="672911" linkType="Reference"&gt;672911&lt;/ulink&gt;],[&lt;ulink linkID="674982" linkType="Reference"&gt;674982&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In  June 2007,  similar data were presented at the 67th ADA Scientific Sessions in Chicago, IL.  Data  also showed that a small mean decline in lung function in patients on Exubera was reversed when Exubera was discontinued.  These changes then returned once Exubera use was re-initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="805303" linkType="Reference"&gt;805303&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In an open-label, randomized, crossover study, it was shown in 67 volunteers that prior treatment with  albuterol increased mean inhaled insulin AUC and Cmax by 25 to 35% and by 45 to 50% in mild and moderate asthma subjects, respectively. &lt;ulink linkID="3159" linkType="Drug"&gt;Fluticasone&lt;/ulink&gt; did not affect inhaled insulin pharmacokinetics [&lt;ulink linkID="672487" linkType="Reference"&gt;672487&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An open-label, four-way randomized-sequence crossover study showed that the within-subject variability for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for inhaled and sc insulin were similar in 22 type 1 diabetics [&lt;ulink linkID="672489" linkType="Reference"&gt;672489&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2005, clinical data were presented at the 65th ADA scientific sessions in San Diego, CA. Exubera was compared with sc short-acting insulin (in combination with qd, bid, intermediate or long-acting insulin) in a 24-week, parallel-group, multicenter study of patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 226, age 25 to 65 years). A1C, FEVC1 and serum insulin antibodies were measured periodically. FEVC1 measurements (prior to dosing and at 10 and 60 min afterwards) at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12 were used to assess development of airway sensitization. After a 12-week comparative period, a 12-week follow up period began in which all patients received only sc insulin. No decline in FEVC1  was observed, nor  was any evidence between antibody levels and lung function detected. It was concluded that small differences in sensitive measures of lung function did not relate to an immunological response to Exubera [&lt;ulink linkID="606313" linkType="Reference"&gt;606313&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="607005" linkType="Reference"&gt;607005&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="607400" linkType="Reference"&gt;607400&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="607449" linkType="Reference"&gt;607449&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At  the end of the 12-week comparative period, similar declines from the baseline HbA1C (7.5% for both groups) to 7.1% for Exubera and 7.0% for the sc insulin.  Overall hypoglycemic events rates occurred at 6.8 and 5.5 events per subject in the Exubera and sc insulin arms, respectively. Severe hypoglycemia occurred in 9 and 17 patients in the Exubera and sc insulin arms, respectively, corresponding to event rates of 0.053 and 0.103 events per subject [&lt;ulink linkID="606127" linkType="Reference"&gt;606127&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Further data were presented  at the 65th ADA scientific sessions in San Diego, CA, from a pooled analysis of two phase III studies.   The studies demonstrated that the addition of Exubera to oral agents taken by patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 158) contributed to maintaining glycemic index control (baseline to endpoint HbA1C: 9.6 to 7.7%) for 2 years with no clinically important effects on pulmonary function compared with patients treated with oral agents alone (n =146: baseline to endpoint HbA1C: 9.6 to 8.1%)   [&lt;ulink linkID="606146" linkType="Reference"&gt;606146&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="607400" linkType="Reference"&gt;607400&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="607449" linkType="Reference"&gt;607449&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="607952" linkType="Reference"&gt;607952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2004, data were presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, in Munich, Germany, from two studies designed to assess the efficacy of Exubera when added to either &lt;ulink linkID="47122" linkType="Drug"&gt;sulfonylurea&lt;/ulink&gt; or &lt;ulink linkID="6050" linkType="Drug"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt;, compared to the combination of these oral agents alone. A total of 304 patients experienced declines in pulmonary function from baseline, in both the Exubera and the control treatment groups. At week 24, differences in declines in FEV1 and DLCO in favor of oral agents were observed (FEV1 -0.063 l/s; DLCO -0.275 ml/min/mmHg). The 2-year difference in FEV1 was -0.039 l/s favoring the oral agent group and the difference in DLCO was +0.112 ml/min/mmHg favoring the Exubera-treated group. HbA1c blood glucose levels over time decreased from 9.6 to 7.7% after 2 years for patients receiving Exubera and to 8.1% for patients in the control group [&lt;ulink linkID="557956" linkType="Reference"&gt;557956&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="557854" linkType="Reference"&gt;557854&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2004, clinical data on Exubera were presented at the 64th ADA scientific sessions in Orlando, FL. A total of 423 type 2 diabetes subjects from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America were randomized to Exubera (n = 222) or &lt;ulink linkID="6050" linkType="Drug"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; (n = 201) for 24 weeks. Study discontinuation was greater for metformin (11%) than Exubera (6%) and overall quality of life improved similarly for both treatments, although more dissatisfaction with side effects (weight gain and hypoglycemia) was found for Exubera. Endpoint HbA1c was lower for Exubera (7.8%) than MET (8.3%) [&lt;ulink linkID="542808" linkType="reference"&gt;542808&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In another study presented at the 64th ADA meeting, type 2 diabetes patients failing on diet or oral therapy were randomized into two groups (n = 388 and 391) and asked to make a choice of diabetes therapy, including no change in their current treatment, after receiving educational material about Exubera. Despite a mean HbA1c of 9.1%, 43.3% in one group chose to make no change to their therapy, while fewer patients (27.4%) in the second group chose to make no change. In this second group, Exubera was most frequently chosen option (35.3%) [&lt;ulink linkID="544811" linkType="reference"&gt;544811&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Also presented at the 64th ADA meeting were results from a phase II study in patients with diabetes who had completed any of three 3-month, randomized, controlled clinical trials. Mean HbA1c was 8.23% after 4 years in Exubera patients compared with 8.71% at the start of Exubera treatment, and the rate of overall hypoglycemia decreased from 2.58 episodes/subject month in the first 4 weeks of Exubera treatment to 1.50 after 4 years. Annual changes in the lung function parameters FEV1 and DL(CO) in Exubera patients over 4 years were -0.057 l/year and -0.376 ml/min/mmHg/year, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="542810" linkType="reference"&gt;542810&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Further data were presented at the 64th ADA meeting. In an open-label, 24-week study extended to 52 weeks, patients originally receiving &lt;ulink linkID="6050" linkType="Drug"&gt;metformin&lt;/ulink&gt; or sulphonylurea were randomized to either adjunctive inhaled insulin (n = 471), metformin or glibenclamide (336 and 291, respectively). Mean HbA1c was decreased from 9.6 at baseline to 7.4% at week 24 and glycemic control was maintained during the extension [&lt;ulink linkID="541627" linkType="reference"&gt;541627&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="542646" linkType="reference"&gt;542646&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a study also presented at the 64th ADA meeting, 45 type 1 diabetes patients were randomized to receive NPH-insulin bid and a preprandial administration of either sc regular insulin or Exubera for 24 weeks. Insulin antibodies rose by 98 microU/mL with Exubera within 24 weeks but were stable with subcutaneous regular insulin. Blood glucose profiles and pharmacodynamic responses were indistinguishable and changes in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels were comparable [&lt;ulink linkID="542160" linkType="reference"&gt;542160&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="542554" linkType="reference"&gt;542554&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By January 2004, phase III trials were complete [&lt;ulink linkID="519897" linkType="reference"&gt;519897&lt;/ulink&gt;]. As of February 2004, over 2000 patients had been enrolled into late-stage trials, with treatment lasting up to 5 years for some. The reductions in FEV stabilized to normal reductions related to aging [&lt;ulink linkID="521119" linkType="reference"&gt;521119&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2003, clinical data on Exubera were presented at the 63rd ADA meeting in New Orleans, LA. In a phase III study in 145 patients with type  2 diabetes to compare the efficacy of Exubera to &lt;ulink linkID="8976" linkType="Drug"&gt;rosiglitazone&lt;/ulink&gt;, the absolute hemoglobin A1c decrease was found to be significantly greater in the Exubera (2.3%) group than in the rosiglitazone group (1.4%). This decrease was accompanied by a 1.9 kg and a 0.8 kg change in body weight for the Exubera group and the rosiglitazone group, respectively, with the rate of overall hypoglycemia being higher in the Exubera group. No severe hypoglycemic events were reported. Also at the 63rd ADA meeting, data were presented from a crossover study involving 20 non-diabetic male smokers and 10 matched non-smokers, who were randomized to receive Exubera (1 mg) or an sc equivalent (3 units). The smokers received Exubera at 12 h, then 3 and 7 days into a smoking cessation period, after which time smoking was resumed. Insulin absorption, which was 2- to 3-fold higher in smokers prior to cessation compared to non-smokers, declined during the non-smoking period and the absorption profile was similar to non-smokers after 1 week. Resumption restored the high absorption profile [&lt;ulink linkID="492747" linkType="reference"&gt;492747&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="492748" linkType="reference"&gt;492748&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="493626" linkType="reference"&gt;493626&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A study of 20 subjects demonstrated that 4 mg Exubera was absorbed more rapidly than sc insulin, and had a similar or better within-subject variability in elderly obese patients with type 2 diabetes [&lt;ulink linkID="493086" linkType="reference"&gt;493086&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="493754" linkType="reference"&gt;493754&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Exubera-treated patients demonstrated better lipid profiles than rosiglitazone-treated patients, with larger increases in total and LDL-cholesterol for rosiglitazone and significant decreases in blood triglycerides for Exubera [&lt;ulink linkID="510213" linkType="reference"&gt;510213&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2002, phase III data on Exubera were presented at the 62nd ADA meeting in San Francisco, CA. In a 3-month study in 109 type 2 diabetic patients, the therapy alone, or in combination with oral agents, caused a significant reduction in hemoglobin A1c levels; those receiving oral agents alone experienced no change. Patients receiving the therapy also showed significantly greater decreases in both fasting plasma glucose levels and 2-h postprandial glucose levels [&lt;ulink linkID="454862" linkType="reference"&gt;454862&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="454292" linkType="reference"&gt;454292&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="454963" linkType="reference"&gt;454963&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="454853" linkType="reference"&gt;454853&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Further data were presented in June 2002 at the ADA meeting from a 6-month phase III study involving 328 patients with type I diabetes. Subjects received Exubera, plus two daily insulin injections, or a regimen of four insulin injections per day. Those receiving Exubera experienced a decrease in HbA1c similar to patients taking only insulin injections. In addition, patients who received Exubera experienced significant reductions in both fasting plasma, and two-hour postprandial glucose levels, compared  with patients who received only insulin injections [&lt;ulink linkID="454300" linkType="reference"&gt;454300&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="454963" linkType="reference"&gt;454963&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="454855" linkType="reference"&gt;454855&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="463828" linkType="reference"&gt;463828&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2001, data on Exubera were presented at the 61st ADA meeting in Philadelphia, PA. In a 6-month phase III study involving 334 patients with type I diabetes, HbA1c levels were comparable between those who were maintained on conventional injection therapy (7.7%) and those who inhaled insulin before meals and received one bedtime long-acting ultralente injection (7.9%) [&lt;ulink linkID="413549" linkType="reference"&gt;413549&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="413553" linkType="reference"&gt;413553&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data from this study were presented in May 2002, at the annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [&lt;ulink linkID="450246" linkType="reference"&gt;450246&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the 61st ADA meeting in Philadelphia, PA (June 2001), data were also presented from a trial of inhaled insulin tested in 309 type 2 patients. In the trial, patients were divided into three groups: those receiving conventional oral therapy (failing), conventional oral therapy (failing) plus inhaled insulin, or inhaled insulin. HbA1c levels were comparable in the latter two groups (7.3 and 7.9%, respectively), while in those remaining on conventional oral therapies, HbA1c levels remained as baseline (9.1%) [&lt;ulink linkID="413549" linkType="reference"&gt;413549&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="413553" linkType="reference"&gt;413553&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Patient dosing in phase III trials to test the systemic delivery of insulin through the lungs began in June 1999. Trials were expected to be completed by the end of 2000, and were projected to include type I and II diabetics at 117 sites [&lt;ulink linkID="329663" linkType="reference"&gt;329663&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="304513" linkType="reference"&gt;304513&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2001, data from a phase II study comparing inhaled with conventional injected insulin in 73 patients, were published. Changes in HbA1c were indistinguishable between the two groups. Changes in fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations were also similar between groups. Overall, inhaled insulin was well tolerated and had no effect on pulmonary function. It was concluded that preprandial insulin can be given by inhalation in diabetics as a less invasive alternative to conventional preprandial insulin injections [&lt;ulink linkID="399739" linkType="reference"&gt;399739&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2000, Inhale presented data from a phase II extension study. The data showed that HbA1c levels remained stable in patients for up to 30 months of therapy. Pooled efficacy data were presented showing HbA1c at 8.7% at baseline, 8.1% at 12 months, 8.0% at 18 months, and 8.0% at 24 months. At the time these data were compiled, 83 patients had completed 24 months of inhaled therapy. Further data indicated continued efficacy for patients who completed 30 months of therapy. Additionally, safety data from four different lung function tests showed that lung function was stable during the course of treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="370987" linkType="reference"&gt;370987&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="371128" linkType="reference"&gt;371128&lt;/ulink&gt;].   &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In an assessment of patient satisfaction from a phase II trial involving 56 patients, inhaled insulin was preferred to sc insulin due to ease of use, comfort and convenience [&lt;ulink linkID="371120" linkType="reference"&gt;371120&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar results were obtained with a type I patient cohort [&lt;ulink linkID="371138" linkType="reference"&gt;371138&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 1998, data were released from a 12-week study evaluating inhaled insulin in combination with an oral hypoglycemic agent. The study involved 69 poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients who were randomized to receive oral agents alone or in combination with preprandially administered inhaled human insulin  tid. HbA1c values dropped by more than 2% in the combination group, whereas no change compared to baseline was observed in the oral agents group. Fasting blood-glucose and postprandial glucose levels were remarkably reduced in the combination group [&lt;ulink linkID="299345" linkType="reference"&gt;299345&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Preliminary results from a phase IIb trial, announced in September 1998, showed that a marked improvement in glycemic control could be achieved without insulin injections by a combination of Inhale's insulin and oral diabetes agents. In the 3-month multicenter trial, Hb1Ac levels were reduced in treated patients by 2.3%, whilst patients using oral agents alone showed a change of just 0.1%. Both groups began the study with unacceptable glucose levels. The inhaled insulin was well tolerated and no changes in lung function were noted [&lt;ulink linkID="297842" linkType="reference"&gt;297842&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The results of several investigations of the company's pulmonary insulin were reported in June 1998. In one study, 70 patients with type I diabetes were randomized to receive insulin by either inhalation or sc injection for 3 months. The level of glycemic control was not significantly different between the two groups. A second study randomized 51 patients with type 2 diabetes to either inhaled treatment or sc injections for 3 months. Improvements in blood glucose were seen in both groups, with a similar level of glycemic control. The incidence of hypoglycemia was the same in both groups in both studies. The inhaled treatment was well tolerated, with no changes in pulmonary function in an additional 16 diabetics, and the amount of insulin absorbed by the body in each inhaled dose was shown to be consistent, even in inexperienced users [&lt;ulink linkID="289627" linkType="reference"&gt;289627&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase II trial of Exubera involving type I diabetics was completed in 1997. Results showed that there was no significant difference in HbA1c levels between those treated with inhaled insulin and those treated with normal injected insulin [&lt;ulink linkID="275059" linkType="reference"&gt;275059&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 1996, Exubera entered a phase IIa trial for diabetes. This was completed by the end of 1996. Inhale initiated a phase IIb, multi-center trial in the US in October 1996. This outpatient trial was to involve up to 240 patients and was designed to test the effectiveness of pulmonary-delivered insulin in controlling blood glucose levels following chronic administration in diabetics over several months [&lt;ulink linkID="225557" linkType="reference"&gt;225557&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2005, preclinical data was presented at the 65th scientific sessions of the American Diabetes Association, San Diego, CA. Exubera (1 mg, inhaled) was compared to intravenously delivered insulin (&lt;ulink linkID="3353" linkType="Drug"&gt;Humulin&lt;/ulink&gt;, variable rates) in fasted conscious dogs in order to test the hypothesis that Exubera achieves greater whole body glucose disposal by augmenting muscle glucose uptake. Exubera showed a 2-fold increase in glucose infusion rate and glucose disposal and a 4-fold increase in leg muscle glucose uptake compared with insulin, in agreement  with the hypothesis [&lt;ulink linkID="606289" linkType="Reference"&gt;606289&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="607005" linkType="Reference"&gt;607005&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2005, further preclinical data on Exubera were presented at the 65th ADA scientific sessions in San Diego, CA. An 18[F]-labeled insulin powder was synthesized and validated as a means to study the intrapulmonary distribution and absorption of inhaled insulin. The aerosol characteristics of 18[F]-labeled insulin powder were similar to those of Exubera [&lt;ulink linkID="606283" linkType="Reference"&gt;606283&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2004, preclinical data on Exubera were presented at the 64th ADA scientific sessions in Orlando, FL. Dogs fitted with arterial, portal and hepatic vein catheters were given insulin to inhale (1 mg) or it was infused (variable rates). In the inhaled group, arterial and hepatic sinusoidal insulin rose rapidly to 68 +/- 9 and 55 +/- 7 microU/mL, respectively, then fell to baseline by 185 min. In the iv group, arterial and hepatic sinusoidal insulin also peaked rapidly (67 and 55 microU/mL), and insulin kinetics and AUCs for both groups were identical; however, plasma glucose excursions were much larger in the iv group [&lt;ulink linkID="542158" linkType="reference"&gt;542158&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2003, preclinical data were presented at the 63rd ADA meeting in New Orleans, LA. Exubera was compared to conventional sc insulin in 15 healthy Beagle dogs. Six dogs received sc human regular insulin 0.36 units/kg, while dry powder human insulin 1 and 2 mg was given to another three and six dogs by endotracheal delivery, respectively. After inhalation of 1 and 2 mg, arterial insulin levels rose to a maximum of 55 and 92 microU/ml, respectively, before declining to fasting levels by 3 h. Portal levels were lower than arterial levels at both doses. Regular sc insulin had a lower peak arterial concentration of 55 microU/ml at 64 min, and returned to baseline after 6 h [&lt;ulink linkID="492880" linkType="reference"&gt;492880&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;PEGYLATED FORMULATION&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2003, Nektar presented preclinical data on a PEGylated version of insulin designed for use in a dry powder inhaler [&lt;ulink linkID="492853" linkType="reference"&gt;492853&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="518530" linkType="reference"&gt;518530&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no further development of this formulation has been reported.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2003, preclinical data were presented at the 63rd ADA meeting in New Orleans, LA. Intratracheal liquid instillation studies in rats showed that a 750 molecular weight PEG attached to insulin was capable of crossing the lungs efficiently, with prolonged serum insulin levels and serum glucose suppression. Beagle dogs were administered 750-PEG-insulin formulated into a dry powder or regular insulin via aerosol to the lungs. Both inhaled PEG-insulin and insulin alone caused a rapid increase in serum insulin, with a Tmax of &amp;lt; 15 min for both. Serum glucose levels for both groups fell from 75 mg/dl to 25 mg/dl. Serum insulin returned to baseline 2 h after dosing for regular insulin and 10 h for PEG-insulin.

Despite the known benefits of glycemic control with intensive insulin therapy, this method has not gained widespread acceptance. Multiple daily injections are inconvenient, compliance is poor and the time and resources required for successful implementation may limit acceptance among providers. In addition, there appear to be tremendous psychological barriers expressed by the patients, which may limit their advancing to intensive insulin therapy. Thus, based on the practical and psychological hurdles of intensive insulin therapy, many patients remain with suboptimal glycemic control [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426610"&gt;426610&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Novel insulin delivery systems aim to overcome some of the limitations of insulin injections. Exubera uses a pulmonary delivery system that permits non-invasive delivery of insulin to the alveoli. This product is currently being evaluated in phase III trials in the US and Europe, and the delivery system developed by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17221"&gt;Inhale Therapeutic Systems Inc&lt;/ulink&gt; is currently in joint clinical development by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18767"&gt;Pfizer Inc&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="25218"&gt;Aventis Pharma AG&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="413549"&gt;413549&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Exubera is a dry-powder insulin-inhalation system that delivers human insulin to the lung alveoli. &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17221"&gt;Inhale Therapeutic Systems&lt;/ulink&gt; has developed custom techniques to enable it to consistently produce fine dry powders, with particle diameters of between 1 and 5 mm without drug degradation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="239678"&gt;239678&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The insulin is packaged in individual blisters containing either 1 or 3 mg of recombinant human insulin in 5 mg of powder comprising mannitol, glycine and sodium citrate. One inhalation of each dosage delivers to the systemic circulation the approximate equivalent of 3 and 9 units (U) of subcutaneous (sc) insulin, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="399739"&gt;399739&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;In 1971, Wigley and colleagues demonstrated the hypoglycemic effects of aerosolized insulin delivered via a nebulizer in rabbits [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426611"&gt;426611&lt;/ulink&gt;]. They also reported increased levels of plasma immunoreactive insulin in three normal volunteers and four patients with diabetes. Subsequently, it was shown that particle size was the main determinant for efficient delivery of insulin to the alveoli. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;The time-concentration profile of inhaled insulin in blood is similar to physiological insulin secretion. In a study of 11 healthy volunteers using a euglycemic clamp, Heinemann and colleagues compared the pharmacodynamics of microcrystalline dry human insulin powder (99 U), injections of regular human insulin (10 U sc) and regular human insulin (5 U intravenous (iv)) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426613"&gt;426613&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The onset of action of inhaled insulin was faster than that of sc insulin (31 versus 52 min). The maximal metabolic response was also faster after inhalation than sc injection (108 versus 147 min). Owing to the probable loss of insulin in the device and upper airway, the bioavailability of inhaled insulin was +/- 10% compared to injectable insulin [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="318119"&gt;318119&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426613"&gt;426613&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Recently, in a study of 18 healthy, non-smoking, male volunteers the time-action profile of inhaled insulin was compared to sc regular insulin and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3353"&gt;insulin lispro&lt;/ulink&gt; (Lispro, Humalog, Humulin; &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17810"&gt;Eli Lilly &amp;amp; Co&lt;/ulink&gt;) with a euglycemic clamp [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426618"&gt;426618&lt;/ulink&gt;]. After 2 h, subjects received inhaled insulin (6 mg), regular insulin (18 U) or Lispro sc. Inhaled insulin showed a faster onset of action than sc regular insulin and even Lispro, with early t1/2 values of 32, 48 and 40 min, respectively. The maximal metabolic action was comparable for the three groups. The duration of action of inhaled insulin was between that of Lispro and regular insulin (382, 309 and 413 min, respectively).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Similar data on the pharmacokinetics of inhaled insulin have also been shown in patients with diabetes. In a study of seven patients with type II diabetes, Laube and colleagues described the pharmacokinetics of inhaled insulin. The peak insulin levels were obtained after 43 min for inhaled insulin and after 64 min for sc insulin. The bioavailability of inhaled insulin was 15% compared to sc insulin [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426639"&gt;426639&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In another study, Gelfand and colleagues compared the pharmacokinetics and postprandial control of inhaled insulin with sc insulin and found no significant differences in reduction in postprandial hyperglycemia between the two groups. Inhaled insulin produced a faster peak and fall of plasma insulin levels than sc insulin [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426621"&gt;426621&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;Studies (1 and 6 months) of intrapulmonary human insulin powder were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys [data on file, &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18767"&gt;Pfizer Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In both species, daily inhalation of powdered insulin was well tolerated and the animals showed no signs of airway or pulmonary lesions on postmortem gross or histological examination. Increased serum insulin levels and reduced blood glucose levels confirmed the systemic absorption of inhaled insulin [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426610"&gt;426610&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;As described above, Heinemann and colleagues have examined the pharmacokinetics of inhaled insulin in healthy volunteers. Inhaled insulin has a faster onset of action than sc regular insulin and inhaled insulin resembles Lispro in its time to peak effect. The offset of action of inhaled insulin appears intermediate between that of regular insulin and Lispro. The relative bioefficacy of 1 mg of inhaled insulin is +/- 3 U sc [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426613"&gt;426613&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In a 12-week, randomized, proof-of-concept study in 73 patients with type I diabetes mellitus at ten centers in the US, changes in HgbA1c were indistinguishable between the inhaled insulin group and the control group treated with their usual insulin regimen. Changes in fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations, as well as occurrence and severity of hypoglycemia, were similar between the two groups. In this small short-term study, pulmonary function was stable over the study period. Specifically, inhaled insulin was rated higher by the patient with regard to ease of administration, comfort, convenience and overall satisfaction, compared to sc insulin therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="399739"&gt;399739&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A randomized, 12-week study examined the effect of adding inhaled insulin to oral hypoglycemic agents in 69 patients with poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus. HgbA1c values dropped by more than 2% in the combination group, whereas no change, compared to baseline, was observed in the group that was randomized to oral agents alone [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="297842"&gt;297842&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="299345"&gt;299345&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A similar, randomized, 3-month study of patients with type II diabetes mellitus on a stable insulin schedule found that inhaled insulin significantly improved glycemic control compared to baseline, with a decrease in HgbA1c of 0.71% +/- 0.72%, and the change was comparable to the control group receiving sc insulin. Pulmonary function was stable and the patients showed no significant weight change [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426610"&gt;426610&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In all three of the above studies, patients completed satisfaction questionnaires and 82% of those with type I diabetes and 92% of patients with type II diabetes receiving inhaled insulin opted to enter an extension phase [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="330654"&gt;330654&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="399739"&gt;399739&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426610"&gt;426610&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients who switched from sc insulin to inhaled insulin showed significant improvement in global satisfaction, ease of use and convenience, and social stigma. In contrast, patients who switched from inhaled to sc insulin showed a trend towards worsening satisfaction [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="371120"&gt;371120&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="371138"&gt;371138&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Subjects from any of these studies were offered continued inhaled insulin as part of their diabetes regimen. HgbA1c and hypoglycemic event rates have remained below entry levels over a two-year period.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III &lt;/subtitle&gt;A 6-month phase III study of 334 patients with type I diabetes found that the HgbA1c levels were comparable in the conventional insulin-treated patients and those that received inhaled insulin plus a single bedtime ultralente injection. However, the inhaled insulin enhanced patient satisfaction, quality of life and acceptance of intensive insulin therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="413549"&gt;413549&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase III study of 309 patients with type II diabetes on failing oral therapies revealed significant improvement in glycemic control (as assessed with HgbA1c levels) with inhaled insulin alone or in combination with the oral agents, when compared to oral agents alone. In terms of patient satisfaction, the two groups using inhaled insulin preferred the inhaled insulin to their previous regimen [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="413549"&gt;413549&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;In phase II studies, the frequency and nature of adverse events were comparable between the groups, with symptoms of hypoglycemia being the most common adverse events in both treatment arms. The most common respiratory side effect reported among patients was cough, characterized as mild-to-moderate in nature. Pulmonary function tests in the phase II studies were comparable between the groups [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="370987"&gt;370987&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="371128"&gt;371128&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The efficacy and safety of inhaled insulin in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema or in chronic smokers have not been determined in the above mentioned studies. Evaluation of pulmonary function in both phase II and III over a long-term period is ongoing. In December 2001, Pfizer reported that antibody formation and small reductions in FEV (forced expiratory volume) in some phase III subjects treated with inhaled rather than sc insulin was likely to prolong the approval process [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="434770"&gt;434770&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="437378"&gt;437378&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;The benefit of good glycemic control in preventing the chronic complications of diabetes mellitus is well known [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="211250"&gt;211250&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="315243"&gt;315243&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In patients with type I diabetes, insulin therapy is essential. Also, insulin is used frequently to achieve glycemic goals in patients with type II diabetes. In the US, about 40% of patients with type II diabetes use insulin [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426661"&gt;426661&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, despite the benefits, intensive insulin therapy has not gained widespread acceptance in clinical practice because of barriers to insulin use [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426631"&gt;426631&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Firstly, multiple daily injections are inconvenient and poorly accepted by patients. Secondly, there is a resistance among patients to advance to insulin because of real or perceived concerns. Some of these concerns relate to pain of injection, the concept that insulin is an intervention of last resort and requires an injection, or the concern for hypoglycemia. Exubera, by administering insulin non-invasively, may overcome some of the major barriers to insulin use. The above studies show that inhaled insulin is effective, well tolerated and acceptable to patients. Also, the pharmacokinetics reveal a more physiological insulin profile than conventional sc insulin. However, further studies are needed to confirm the long-term safety and efficacy.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="18767">Pfizer
