In December 2015, BMS and Ono filed lawsuits against Merck in France, Ireland, Switzerland and Germany alleging infringement of the ’878 patent and in January 2016, that also happened in Spain. At that time, the trial regarding the validity and infringement of the Dutch national version of the ’878 patent was held. By February 2016, Merck had appealed the October 2015 UK court decision and BMS and Ono had filed for preliminary relief seeking payment of damages in France while the case was pending; a hearing on the preliminary relief was set for February 2016. At that time, Merck expected a decision on the Dutch version of the ’878 patent in April 2016 and a trial regarding the infringement of the German version of the '878 patent was set to commence in March 2017; by that time, no trial dates had been set for the Irish, French, Swiss and Spanish national versions of the '878 patent [&lt;ulink linkID="1743025" linkType="Reference"&gt;1743025&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Patients who received &amp;gt;/= 1 dose of pembrolizumab in second line (n= 171) or later (n = 65) were included; patients were followed for a median of 12.5 months. Median time on treatment was 4.4 months (overall), with 4.7 and 4.4 months in patients who  had failed two and three prior lines of therapy, respectively. In overall population and patients who  had failed two and three prior lines of therapy, overall survival was 16.8, 16.8 and 18.9 months; one-year survival (Kaplan Meier) was 58, 57.4 and 59.6%; second-year survival was 44.7, 44.3 and 46.1%, respectively.

Of 132 patients who received pembrolizumab monotherapy identified by retrospective medical record review, 33 discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression. The median PFS was 29 months with a median follow up of 25 months. Increased duration of pembrolizumab exposure following treatment discontinuation led to significant improvement in survival (p = 0.002), with higher OS in patients who received 6 to 12 months of treatment compared to those who received less than 6 months of treatment (p = 0.004). However, in patients treated longer than 12 months no additional significant benefit was noted [&lt;ulink linkID="2039912" linkType="Reference"&gt;2039912&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2018, data from a retrospective, chart-review study which evaluated the real-world utilization and patient outcomes associated with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma in US academic centers and affiliated satellite clinics, were presented at the 54th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL. In the observational cohort, 148 real-world pembrolizumab-treated patients were included. The real-world response rate (complete or partial) was 70.0 and 36.5% in observational cohort and KEYNOTE-006, respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.001).

A total of 38 and 14% of patients experienced any grade and grade &amp;gt;/= 3 irAE, respectively. A single patient died of pneumonitis. Patients with any irAE were more likely to have better performance status (p = 0.011), normal LDH (p = 0.037) and received more cycles (p &amp;lt; 0.001). In patients who developed any irAE, ORR was &amp;gt; 35% (p &amp;lt; 0.001).

In January 2017, further data, from the data cut off in April 2016, were presented at ECCO 2017 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Following on from the previous data cut off of March 23, 2015, there were two additional patients with TRAE, and three additional grade 3 to 5 TRAEs (grade 3 colitis and lymphopenia), and one more patient discontinued treatment because of TRAE (grade 2 pneumonia). There were no additional potentially immune-mediated AEs or treatment-related deaths.

In June 2017, the tumor samples from 172 patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC in two combined cohorts who had been assigned treatment with pembrolizumab during the KEYNOTE-012 trial were evaluated. The clinical response was related to expression of PD-L2, and  suggested that therapy targeting both PD-L1 and PD-L2 might enhance patient response. The overall response rate (ORR) for the two KEYNOTE-012 cohorts in the study were 27.5% among patients whose tumors were positive for both PD-L1 and PD-L2, and was more than two times higher than the 11.4% ORR for patients whose tumors were positive only for PD-L1. The PD-L2 positivity was associated with longer overall survival (OS), and median OS times were 303 and 109 days, respectively. Similar data were published [&lt;ulink linkID="1937974" linkType="Reference"&gt;1937974&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1938052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1938052&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2011, an open-label, phase I trial (&lt;ulink linkID="74756" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01295827&lt;/ulink&gt;; P07990; MK-3475-001; PN 001; KEYNOTE-001) was initiated in the US to evaluate pembrolizumab (administered as an iv infusion) in patients (expected n = 32) with locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma, melanoma or NSCLC.  In Part A of the study, the dose of iv pembrolizumab was to be escalated to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for participants with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of any type of carcinoma or melanoma. Part B of the study was to explore the efficacy of the drug at the MTD in advanced or metastatic melanoma. A  third part would explore the drug in NSCLC. Primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities and response rate. At that time, trial completion was expected in March 2013  [&lt;ulink linkID="1179661" linkType="Reference"&gt;1179661&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In the 1-, 3- and 10-mg cohorts, pembrolizumab had Cmax values of 16.8, 109 and 271 microg/ml, respectively, and t1/2 values of 15.1, 21.8 and 20.9 days, respectively. Best response was observed with one stable disease (SD) and one unconfirmed partial response (PR) in the 1-mg/kg group, one confirmed PR and one SD in the 3-mg/kg group, and three SDs and one confirmed PR in the 10-mg/kg group. Part B was a single-arm, open-label, expansion cohort in which patients with melanoma received pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg, qod). At week 12 in the part B cohort, SD, unconfirmed PR and unconfirmed complete response were observed in five, two and one patient(s), respectively, based on the Immune-Related Response Criteria (primary endpoint), and in two, three and one patient(s), respectively, based on RECIST.
