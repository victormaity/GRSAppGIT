In July 2007, AstraZeneca began a phase IIb trial for mild-to-moderate AD [&lt;ulink linkID="815034" linkType="Reference"&gt;815034&lt;/ulink&gt;];  in September 2008, data were reported in which the drug missed its primary endpoint.  At that time, data analysis was ongoing and  AstraZeneca was considering whether to continue  further development  [&lt;ulink linkID="943496" linkType="Reference"&gt;943496&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2011, Targacept was evaluating the practicability of continued development for the indication [&lt;ulink linkID="1167460" linkType="Reference"&gt;1167460&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2013, AstraZeneca returned the drug to Targacept, which was presumed to continue development [&lt;ulink linkID="1388731" linkType="Reference"&gt;1388731&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The drug was previously under development for schizophrenia-associated cognitive deficits [&lt;ulink linkID="753585" linkType="Reference"&gt;753585&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2007, a phase IIb trial for schizophrenia-associated cognitive deficits began [&lt;ulink linkID="824725" linkType="Reference"&gt;824725&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in December 2008, following the failure of the drug to meet the primary endpoint of the study, the companies did not plan to progress the drug into phase III for this indication [&lt;ulink linkID="969396" linkType="Reference"&gt;969396&lt;/ulink&gt;].   The drug was also under development for other cognitive impairment disorders including age-associated memory impairment (AAMI)  and other dementias. A phase II trial in age-associated memory impairment was initiated in May 2004  [&lt;ulink linkID="545766" linkType="Reference"&gt;545766&lt;/ulink&gt;].  However, no development has been reported in AAMI since June 2006. AstraZeneca and Targacept were also developing the drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [&lt;ulink linkID="512600" linkType="Reference"&gt;512600&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="545766" linkType="Reference"&gt;545766&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="642785" linkType="Reference"&gt;642785&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="762824" linkType="Reference"&gt;762824&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="915122" linkType="Reference"&gt;915122&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A phase II ADHD trial was initiated in June 2008    [&lt;ulink linkID="915122" linkType="Reference"&gt;915122&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in May 2009, AstraZeneca was planning to decide in the second quarter of 2009 whether to develop the drug further for AD and ADHD   [&lt;ulink linkID="915122" linkType="Reference"&gt;&lt;/ulink&gt;&lt;ulink linkID="1008280" linkType="Reference"&gt;1008280&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2010, Targacept expected AstraZeneca to conduct further phase IIb development for ADHD, with the next study  expected to begin in adults in mid-2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1074892" linkType="Reference"&gt;1074892&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in August 2010, the trial was expected to start in first quarter of 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1121540" linkType="Reference"&gt;1121540&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2011, AstraZeneca was to make a decision regarding the development of the drug for ADHD in the  first half of 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1167460" linkType="Reference"&gt;1167460&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2011,  Targacept reported that AstraZeneca did not expect further development of AZD-3480 in ADHD [&lt;ulink linkID="1235512" linkType="Reference"&gt;1235512&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;ADHD&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2008, an exploratory, placebo-controlled, crossover, randomized, double-blind phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="15431" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00683462&lt;/ulink&gt;; TC-1734-226-CRD-005) was initiated in subjects (expected n = 24, non-smoking adults) with ADHD in US. The subjects were to receive daily doses of 5 or 50 mg of ispronicline or placebo, each for  2 weeks with the dosing periods separated by a 3-week washout period. The primary endpoint was the Connors adult ADHD rating scale-investigator rating (CAARS-INV) score [&lt;ulink linkID="915122" linkType="Reference"&gt;915122&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="989113" linkType="Reference"&gt;989113&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2009, enrollment had been completed [&lt;ulink linkID="983851" linkType="Reference"&gt;983851&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2009, preliminary data were reported showing that the trial had met its primary endpoint, with a significant improvement in symptoms seen with the 50 mg dose of ispronicline. The 50 mg dose also met several secondary endpoints including stop signal reaction time. The drug was well tolerated with no serious side effects [&lt;ulink linkID="1008280" linkType="Reference"&gt;1008280&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2010, clinical data were presented at the 40th SFN Meeting in San Diego, CA. In the NBack task, the 50-mg dose improved working   memory in the 0-back (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and 2-back (p &amp;lt; 0.05) conditions, while improvements were only observed in the 0-back condition with the 5-mg dose (p &amp;lt; 0.01). No AZD-3480-related effects on risk taking or delay aversion occurred  [&lt;ulink linkID="1145256" linkType="Reference"&gt;1145256&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Cognitive defecits in schizophrenia&lt;/subtitle&gt;In August 2007, AstraZeneca started a phase IIb HALO trial of ispronicline for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (CDS). The North American, randomized, placebo-controlled,  double blind, 12-week study would compare the drug with placebo in 400 patients taking atypical anti-psychotics. The primary endpoint was assessment of cognitive function, and the secondary endpoints included performance in day-to-day tasks and social skills [&lt;ulink linkID="824725" linkType="Reference"&gt;824725&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="849495" linkType="Reference"&gt;849495&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By August 2008, the trial was fully enrolled  [&lt;ulink linkID="931890" linkType="Reference"&gt;931890&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2008, data were reported showing that TETA drug did not improve cognition. AZD-3480 was generally well tolerated. Following the failure of the drug to meet the primary endpoint of the study, the companies did not plan to progress the drug into phase III [&lt;ulink linkID="969396" linkType="Reference"&gt;969396&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Age-associated memory impairment&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2004, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial of ispronicline in 56 elderly volunteers with AAMI was ongoing at multiple sites in the US under a clinical trial exemption. The trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of ispronicline, and changes in cognitive function and mood state [&lt;ulink linkID="545766" linkType="Reference"&gt;545766&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2005, clinical data were presented at the 8th World Congress of Biological Psychiatry in Vienna, Austria. The drug improved memory and attention in elderly subjects, with effects that extended beyond the elimination of the drug from the body [&lt;ulink linkID="611220" linkType="Reference"&gt;611220&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="612281" linkType="Reference"&gt;612281&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2005, AstraZeneca licensed exclusive rights to the drug; however, Targacept would complete the US phase II study independently [&lt;ulink linkID="642785" linkType="Reference"&gt;642785&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In December 2005, Targacept stated that the AAMI trial had been completed  [&lt;ulink linkID="645405" linkType="Reference"&gt;645405&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2006, data were presented at the International Geneva/Springfield Symposium of Advances in Alzheimer Therapy in Geneva, Switzerland. A total of 193 patients with AAMI and aged between 50 and 80 years were treated with 25 or 50 mg of the drug once daily over a 16-week period. The drug significantly increased power of attention and episodic memory and was also well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="668211" linkType="Reference"&gt;668211&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were presented in June 2006, at SMI's Depression and Anxiety meeting in London, UK. Power of attention and continuity of attention were significantly improved compared to baseline at the 25 mg dose. Patients in the 50 mg dose group showed an overall increase in power or attention, quality of episodic memory, SGI - overall cognitive change, quality of working memory and speed of memory. Attention change, memory change and speed of thinking change were also improved from baseline to week 16 at the 50 mg dose [&lt;ulink linkID="676723" linkType="Reference"&gt;676723&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2004, a second double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 40 elderly volunteers with MCI was ongoing in the UK [&lt;ulink linkID="545766" linkType="Reference"&gt;545766&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2005, data from the MCI trial in patients with were presented at the International Psychogeriatric Association 12th Congress in Stockholm, Sweden. Ispronicline (50 or 100 mg) was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with light-headedness being the most common adverse event. The 50 mg cohort showed no advantage over placebo; however, the 100 mg cohort was superior to placebo in four out of five factors testing memory and attention [&lt;ulink linkID="641513" linkType="Reference"&gt;641513&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Alzheimers disease&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2011, a phase II AD trial was expected to start in the second half of 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1189239" linkType="Reference"&gt;1189239&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2011, the  phase IIb portion of a phase II/III study to compare the efficacy of ispronicline with &lt;ulink linkID="2992" linkType="Drug"&gt;donepezil&lt;/ulink&gt; in 300 patients with AD was initiated in Eastern Europe and the US under a SPA agreement with the FDA [&lt;ulink linkID="1229344" linkType="Reference"&gt;1229344&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1239334" linkType="Reference"&gt;1239334&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At that time, the study was scheduled to complete in November 2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1239225" linkType="Reference"&gt;1239225&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2012, recruitment was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1265241" linkType="Reference"&gt;1265241&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in November 2012, topline data from the phase IIb portion were expected in mid-2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1338220" linkType="Reference"&gt;1338220&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2013, patient enrollment was completed in the double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, phase IIb trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1412048" linkType="Reference"&gt;1412048&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in February 2014, it was reported at the 2014 BIO CEO &amp;amp; Investor Conference in New York, NY that results were still expected mid-2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1526510" linkType="Reference"&gt;1526510&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2014, top-line data were reported from the 293-patient trial. The drug was found to be safe and tolerable. After 52 weeks of treatment, the drug did not meet the objective of showing superiority to donepezil. At that time, analyses of the full dataset from the trial were ongoing and the company planned to present and publish data over the ‘coming months’. The company intended not to invest in further development of the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="1577231" linkType="Reference"&gt;1577231&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2007, AstraZeneca began a phase IIb trial for mild-to-moderate AD. Patients in the 500-patient, 12-week, double-blind, European and Canadian study would receive one of three doses of ispronicline or placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="815034" linkType="Reference"&gt;815034&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Data were reported in September 2008 showing the drug had failed to meet its primary endpoint. In the multicenter, randomized, dose-finding, Sirocco study, 567 subjects received AZD-3480, &lt;ulink linkID="2992" linkType="Drug"&gt;donepezil&lt;/ulink&gt; or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change from baseline in ADAS-cog score. The company indicated that the results  were impacted by an improvement in ADAS-cog score in the placebo group. However, improvements were seen in the secondary endpoints of ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer's disease cooperative study) and MMSE (mini mental state examination) with two of the AZD-3480 doses tested. The middle AZD-3480 dose produced 0.5 and 0.9 point improvements in ADCS-CGIC and MMSE scores, respectively, compared with 0.2 and 1 point improvements in the donepezil group. The drug had an overall safety and tolerability profile comparable to placebo, and showed fewer gastrointestinal-related adverse events than donepezil. At that time, full data analysis was ongoing  [&lt;ulink linkID="943496" linkType="Reference"&gt;943496&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2006, AstraZeneca listed the drug  in phase II trials, and, in November 2006, safety and product characterization studies of the drug were being carried out  [&lt;ulink linkID="648528" linkType="Reference"&gt;648528&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="648480" linkType="Reference"&gt;648480&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="740941" linkType="Reference"&gt;740941&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In September 2007, a single-center, double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover phase I study (&lt;ulink linkID="20439" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00689637&lt;/ulink&gt;; D3690C00014; Eudract: 2007-004756-37) began which would evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction of repeated doses of ispronicline (qd po for 22 days) and a single dose of warfarin (day 6) on ispronicline pharmacodynamics in healthy male subjects (expected n = 26) [&lt;ulink linkID="914103" linkType="Reference"&gt;914103&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A similar phase I trial (NCT00689559; D3691C00001; Eudract : 2008-000310-74) investigating the interaction between ispronicline and &lt;ulink linkID="7781" linkType="Drug"&gt;aripiprazole&lt;/ulink&gt; began in March 2008. Healthy subjects (expected n = 52) would receive repeated doses of ispronicline (qd for 12 days) and a single dose of aripiprazole (day 5). The trial was expected to complete in August 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="914236" linkType="Reference"&gt;914236&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2005, data from three phase I studies were presented at the 7th International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease in Sorrento, Italy. In one of these trials, ispronicline dose-dependently induced electrical brain activity characteristic of a nicotine agonist, and confirmed CNS penetration. In the other trials, young adult and elderly volunteers showed positive effects on attention, learning and memory, continuing for up to 48 h in elderly volunteers [&lt;ulink linkID="592125" linkType="Reference"&gt;592125&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By the end of 2003, Targacept had completed four phase I trials of ispronicline, including two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I trials. The first studies examined eight single, escalating doses of up to 320 mg ispronicline in 48 healthy volunteers. The second trial was a multiple escalating-dose trial of ispronicline (50, 100 and 200 mg) conducted in 24 healthy volunteers administered over a 10-day period. The third one was a pharmacokinetic study of a single 80-mg dose in six elderly volunteers to assess the pharmacokinetics of the compound, and the final one was a food interaction trial testing a 80-mg dose in six fed/fasted volunteers.

Although different nAChR subtypes exist in the central nervous system (CNS) as hetero- or homomeric assemblies of alpha and beta subunits, there is evidence that alpha7 homomeric and beta2-containing (beta2*) receptor subunits predominate in the human brain, as do alpha3beta4 subunits to a lesser extent [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="638395"&gt;638395&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="638396"&gt;638396&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="638398"&gt;638398&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The majority of the beta2*- subunits are of the alpha4beta2 nAChR subtype and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data in humans have indicated a high density of this subtype in the cortex and thalamus [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="638427"&gt;638427&lt;/ulink&gt;]. While the majority of data suggest that beta2* nAChR subtypes are selectively affected in Alzheimer's disease, other results suggest that alpha7 nAChR subtypes are also involved. It is of particular interest to note that in schizophrenic patients, both genetic and neuropathological findings suggest that the cognitive deficit is sensitive to nicotinic receptor modulation. The &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20518"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/ulink&gt;-sponsored MATRICS (Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia) project developed a standardized battery of cognitive tests and identified a number of pharmacological approaches, including nAChR modulation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="624144"&gt;624144&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="624147"&gt;624147&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The follow-up project, called TURNS (Treatment Units for Research on Neurocognition in Schizophrenia), selected ispronicline (TC-1734, &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="26249"&gt;Targacept Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;) for a pilot phase II study as an add-on medication with a neuroleptic agent [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="631107"&gt;631107&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Ispronicline is currently undergoing phase II trials by Targacept for the potential treatment of age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="545766"&gt;545766&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A phase II study in Alzheimer's disease has also commenced [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="611220"&gt;611220&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Targacept is considering ispronicline for clinical development in indications such as cognitive impairment (associated with schizophrenia and following coronary artery bypass grafting), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and some forms of dementia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="624033"&gt;624033&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;It has also been proposed that nicotinic receptor stimulation can provide neuroprotection against some aspects of Alzheimer's disease (beta-amyloid and glutamate pathology) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="622041"&gt;622041&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The fact that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="9409"&gt;galantamine&lt;/ulink&gt;, a cholinergic drug that also has an allosteric potentiating ligand effect on nAChRs, is used to treat Alzheimer's patients, opens a window onto the possible clinical potential of nicotinic receptor modulation. As a consequence, the modulation of nicotinic receptors is an interesting therapeutic approach that is being pursued by a number of laboratories because, in principle, it combines symptomatic treatment with neuroprotection [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="516203"&gt;516203&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634638"&gt;634638&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Compounds modulating nAChRs were identified using Targacept's proprietary Pentad in silico technology [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="430095"&gt;430095&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="512600"&gt;512600&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A number of compounds with low nanomolar affinities for the nAChR were identified, but the in vivo half-lives of these compounds were estimated to be too short. An alpha-methyl group was identified as being essential for increasing the half-life from 0.5 to 1.4 h in rodents, as illustrated by the fact that RJR-2403 (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="26249"&gt;Targacept Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="22542"&gt;Dr Falk Pharma GmbH&lt;/ulink&gt;), a neuronal nicotinic receptor ligand in development for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, was rapidly metabolized through N-demethylation and oxidation. As a result of a 'use-patent' problem, clinical development of RJR-2403 was suspended and the in vitro nicotinic receptor alpha4beta2 specificity of ispronicline was investigated. Ispronicline is the 3-isopropoxy-pyridine analog of RJR-2403, synthesized to prevent N-demethylation, and it had potent neuroprotection and dopamine release in rat striatum, without reacting with ganglionic or any other muscle receptors [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="345007"&gt;345007&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="557048"&gt;557048&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In order to prepare ispronicline, (S)-N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine and 3-bromo-5-isopropoxy-pyridine were coupled via a palladium-catalyzed Heck coupling reaction. The resulting intermediate, (S)-(E)-N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-5-[3-(5-isopropoxypyridin)yl]-4-penten-2-amine, was subsequently treated with 6 M hydrochloric acid in dimethylformamide to give the free base of ispronicline [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;Ispronicline is a high-affinity (Ki = 11 nM) agonist of nicotinic receptors in rat brain membrane preparations (nicotine Ki = 4 nM) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="306443"&gt;306443&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="363337"&gt;363337&lt;/ulink&gt;] and reportedly has specificity for alpha4beta2 nAChRs [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="306443"&gt;306443&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in one study in rat hippocampal membranes, ispronicline was ineffective at displacing [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding to alpha7 nAChRs (Ki &amp;gt; 50,000 nM) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No further data are available for the affinities to other brain nAChR receptor subtypes.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Ispronicline did not bind to the muscle-type (alpha1beta1deltagamma) or ganglion-type (alpha3beta4) peripheral nAChRs at concentrations up to 100 microM, as determined by the isotopic ion efflux in the human TE671/RD and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell lines, which express the respective receptors. Conversely, nicotine activated nAChRs in the human and rat cells with EC50 values of 60 and 20 microM, respectively, suggesting that ispronicline has considerable CNS/peripheral nervous system specificity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="306443"&gt;306443&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="376757"&gt;376757&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No other data were provided regarding human nAChRs.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Induction of dopamine release in rat striatal synaptosomes showed that ispronicline had a profile comparable to that of nicotine at these receptors (EC50 = 106 nM and Emax = 85%). In thalamic synaptosomes, ispronicline increased ion influx to an Emax of 58% with an EC50 value of 220 nM, compared with an EC50 value of 590 nM and an Emax of 100% for nicotine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="306443"&gt;306443&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="376757"&gt;376757&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These data are in agreement with observations that striatal dopamine release is regulated by beta2* nAChRs [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="636359"&gt;636359&lt;/ulink&gt;] and confirm the preference of ispronicline for the alpha4beta2 nAChR subtype. Given the preferential localization of alpha4beta2 nAChRs in the thalamus [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="638427"&gt;638427&lt;/ulink&gt;], the effect of ispronicline on thalamic synaptosomes is also very likely mediated via these receptor subtypes.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Ispronicline improved performance in a rat radial arm maze model in vivo, and significant improvements in cognition were observed following oral administration of ispronicline (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 3.0 and 6.0 micromol/kg) in both acute (presumed to be single-dose) and chronic (daily for 6 days) schedules [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="306443"&gt;306443&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The effects on short- and long-term memory in this model reportedly lasted for 18 to &amp;gt; 24 h [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="325629"&gt;325629&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="363337"&gt;363337&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="363536"&gt;363536&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Ispronicline had significant activity in a murine behavioral despair model following intraperitoneal administration of 1 and 3 micromol/kg, but not 10 micromol/kg, and was more effective than the dibenzazepine antidepressant imipramine (40 micromol/kg, ip), showing its potential for additional beneficial effects as an antidepressant [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Ispronicline (0.6, 1.0 and 3.0 micromol/kg) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;] reversed scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits in a rat passive avoidance model (ED50 = 0.89 micromol/kg) with an inverted U-shaped dose-response. This suggests a possible effect on pre-synaptic ACh release and a subsequent stimulation of post-synaptic muscarinic receptors, as scopolamine is not documented to have any effect on nicotinic receptors. This is corroborated by the observation that a synergistic effect was achieved in this model when a sub-optimal dose of ispronicline (0.6 micromol/kg) was combined with ineffective doses of the cholinesterase inhibitors &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4509"&gt;tacrine&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2992"&gt;donepezil&lt;/ulink&gt;. The effect resulted in an enhanced step-through latency in ispronicline combined with each inhibitor, compared with sole ispronicline administration. Step though latencies (as % of control) were as follows: unlesioned, 69%; scopolamine lesioned, 8%; ispronicline (1.0 micromol/kg), 55%; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4509"&gt;tacrine&lt;/ulink&gt; (12 micromol/kg), 36%; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2992"&gt;donepezil&lt;/ulink&gt; (1.0 micromol/kg), 53%; suboptimal ispronicline (0.6 micromol/kg), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4509"&gt;tacrine&lt;/ulink&gt; (1.2 micromol/kg) or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2992"&gt;donepezil&lt;/ulink&gt; (0.1 micromol/kg), 21, 6 and 21%, respectively; and suboptimal ispronicline plus &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4509"&gt;tacrine&lt;/ulink&gt; or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2992"&gt;donepezil&lt;/ulink&gt;: 37 and 39%, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="345774"&gt;345774&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Ispronicline (7 to 14 days at an unstated dose) reduced spontaneous locomotor activity in rats, in a monophasic manner unlike the biphasic activity of nicotine, for the duration of the test (90 min). Chronic administration of the compound resulted in rapid tolerance [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="345791"&gt;345791&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This property might necessitate innovative dosage scheduling in the clinic.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Acute oral administration of ispronicline dose-dependently [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="475601"&gt;475601&lt;/ulink&gt;] increased levels of free ACh in the cortex of rats [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="557048"&gt;557048&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The lowest active dose was 5 mg/kg and the maximally effective dose was 10 mg/kg, and these yielded increases of 36 and 70% over the basal ACh values, respectively. The maximal effect was observed at the 10-mg/kg dose. Addition of a larger dose of ispronicline (20 mg/kg) increased the duration of ACh release (to 4 h), but did not increase the amplitude significantly (84%). With different doses of nicotine (1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, po), the amplitude of the stimulated ACh response did not change, and the maximal increases over the basal levels of ACh were 47, 44 and 56%, respectively, 40 to 80 min after treatment. The non-selective nAChR antagonist mecamylamine (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="26249"&gt;Targacept Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;), which is in development for the potential treatment for various neuropsychiatric disorders, inhibited the ACh release induced by ispronicline and nicotine (maximal effective doses) at a dose of 1 mg/kg when administered subcutaneously 40 min before dosing with ispronicline and nicotine. Oral administration of ispronicline improved object recognition in mice after 24 h. The recognition index (RI) in mice treated with the vehicle was 72 +/- 5 after 3 h and 45 +/- 2 after 24 h; however, after treatment with 0.5 and 1 mg/kg of ispronicline, the RI at 24 h improved to 72 +/- 3 and 55 +/- 3, respectively. Both these effects, the increases in ACh concentration and improved object recognition, were also countered by mecamylamine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="475601"&gt;475601&lt;/ulink&gt;]. After a repeated treatment of 4 days with ispronicline (10 mg/kg) or nicotine (1 mg/kg), no tolerance was observed regarding ACh release [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="376757"&gt;376757&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Ispronicline was neuroprotective in an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced cell-death paradigm and may be synergistic with current Alzheimer's disease therapies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="325629"&gt;325629&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a hippocampal slice model (a mature culture of fetal rat neurons) subjected to a 15-min hypoxia/glucose deprivation episode, ispronicline prevented the loss of synaptic transmission in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal effect of &amp;gt; 70% protection at 10 microM. The effect was mediated through nAChRs because mecamylamine blocked the neuroprotective effect [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="583306"&gt;583306&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This effect is somewhat unexpected given the proposed link between specific alpha7 nAChR activation and neuroprotection. Neurotoxicity stimulated by glutamate is prevented by nicotine in primary cultures of cerebellar neurons and is generally thought to be mediated by alpha7 nAChR activation. However in acutely dissociated slices, neuroprotection by nicotine can be mediated by activation of alpha4beta2 nAChRs and inhibition of alpha7 nAChRs [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="638430"&gt;638430&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Therefore, neuroprotection by ispronicline can be explained by its preferential activation of the alpha4beta2 nAChR. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The mechanism of ispronicline neuroprotection reportedly utilizes a signal transduction pathway involving JAK2, PI3 kinase, Akt and Bcl-2 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="467878"&gt;467878&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Ispronicline (unstated dosage) was orally active in vivo and induced sustained ACh release from the cortex, showing potency in animal models of cognition and attention, and additivity/synergy with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. It demonstrated neuroprotective effects in chemically induced neuronal excitotoxicity models and in hypoxia/glucose deprivation models. Additionally, ispronicline showed antidepressant activity; however, no details were provided for these studies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="513286"&gt;513286&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism and pharmacokinetics&lt;/subtitle&gt;Metabolism studies conducted in vitro with liver microsome preparations from mice, rats, guinea pigs, dogs, monkeys and humans identified five metabolites; the O-dealkyl derivative endogenous conjugate was the primary metabolite in humans and monkeys, while the N-oxide metabolite was present in all other species [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The affinities of the 3-alkylcarbonate and N-desalkylated metabolites for alpha4beta2 nAChRs were approximately 20- and 40-fold higher than for ispronicline; other metabolites had affinities &amp;gt; 100-fold over ispronicline. In Sprague Dawley rats that were administered 20 mg/kg of ispronicline, mass spectroscopy identified 12 metabolites in the plasma; the O-dealkyl derivative being the major metabolite. No metabolites were detected in fecal extracts, although a small amount of the parent compound was present [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Ispronicline had a half-life of 1 to 2 h in rodents [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="557048"&gt;557048&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634416"&gt;634416&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, given that the beneficial effect of a single oral administration of ispronicline on cognition in preclinical models persisted for 18 to 48 h [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="363337"&gt;363337&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634416"&gt;634416&lt;/ulink&gt;], this does not seem to present much of a problem for efficacy. This unexpected long-term potentiation effect might be due to a much higher retention of the compound in the brain, an elaborate downstream effect leading to transient intracellular plasticity changes, or both. In Sprague Dawley rats, oral administration of ispronicline (10 mg/kg) produced high systemic levels, with a maximal plasma concentration (Cpmax) of 370 ng/ml and Tmax value of 0.25 h. The compound was cleared rapidly, with a termination half-life of 1.1 h. The bioavailability of ispronicline was 73.3%. Whole-brain ispronicline levels at this dose were high (maximal brain concentration (Cbmax) = 659 ng/g; Tmax = 0.5 to 2 h), showing that the drug readily penetrated the brain. After intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg, ispronicline had a half-life of 0.8 h and was cleared rapidly (7.1 l/h/kg, compared with the hepatic plasma flow of 2 to 4 l/h/kg) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In dogs, ispronicline had a half-life of 2 h, following a 1-mg/kg intravenous dose. A high total plasma clearance of 3.2 l/h/kg was achieved, compared with the hepatic plasma flow of 1.2 to 2.4 l/h/kg. Following oral administration of 1 mg/kg of ispronicline, low systemic plasma levels were achieved (Cpmax = 35 ng/ml at 0.5 to 2 h). The elimination half-life of ispronicline was 1.3 h and its estimated bioavailability was 31.4% [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a crossover study in six healthy male volunteers, ispronicline (2 to 320 mg, po) had a Tmax at 2 h and an elimination half-life of 4 h; following a 320-mg dose, ispronicline had a Cmax of 120 ng/ml, a plasma concentration 5- to 10-fold greater than that expected to produce maximal cognitive effects [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In elderly AAMI patients (&gt; 60 years of age), a 50-mg oral dose of ispronicline gave rise to a plasma Cmax range of 4 to 25 ng/ml [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="612281"&gt;612281&lt;/ulink&gt;] and oral doses of 25 to 75 mg of ispronicline produced plasma Cmax values in the range of 4 to 55 ng/ml [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634952"&gt;634952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These low Cmax values might be due to extensive metabolism, high plasma clearance or low bioavailability. A complete pharmacokinetic study of a single 80-mg dose of ispronicline was performed in six elderly volunteers to assess its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties. Cognitive improvement was evident after 36 to 48 h, which was comparable to the long duration of action observed in animal models, indicating the suitability of a once-daily dosing schedule [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="615362"&gt;615362&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The study showed that ispronicline had a half-life of 5 to 7 h in humans [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634416"&gt;634416&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Another study in six fed/fasted volunteers examined food interaction following an 80-mg dose of ispronicline, although the results from this study have apparently not yet been reported [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="615362"&gt;615362&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;The results of studies in rats, dogs and rabbits indicated that ispronicline was free from toxic effects at the doses tested. In rats, no effect was observed on diaphragm contraction, respiratory function or gastric emptying after oral administration of up to 50, 250 and 500 mg/kg, respectively. In rats and dogs that were chronically administered ispronicline for 13 weeks (50 and 30 mg/kg, respectively), the only side effect was slight and transient bradycardia in dogs at the highest dose; possibly mediated by autonomic nerve stimulation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="512176"&gt;512176&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Overall, ispronicline was well tolerated in animals, and there was no indication of reproductive, cellular or genetic toxicity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="513286"&gt;513286&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Other preliminary toxicology studies showed a low toxicity for ispronicline, with observable adverse effects occurring in normal male and female rats at doses of 5 to 200 mg/kg, compared with cognitive enhancement at 0.034 mg/kg. At a dose of 1400 mg/kg, significant toxicity was produced without causing death in rats [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="325629"&gt;325629&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Thus, the therapeutic effects of ispronicline in animals are dissociated from side effects by four to five orders of magnitude [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="467878"&gt;467878&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a study conducted in rats trained to discriminate nicotine and ispronicline to the known addictive properties of nicotine were compared. Nicotine engaged appropriate responding in 70% of animals at a dose of 1.9 micromol/kg, compared with ispronicline that engaged an equivalent response only at a dose of 40 micromol/kg; this indicates an approximately 20-fold-reduced propensity for dependence of ispronicline compared with nicotine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;Four phase I trials with ispronicline, which assessed safety, pharmacokinetics and cognitive enhancement, have been completed. One study tested eight escalating single oral doses of ispronicline (2, 4, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 mg) in 48 healthy volunteers [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="559979"&gt;559979&lt;/ulink&gt;], and a multiple escalating-dose trial (50, 100 and 200 mg) was conducted in 24 healthy volunteers over a 10-day period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511071"&gt;511071&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="615362"&gt;615362&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A pharmacokinetic study that tested food interaction in six elderly volunteers was also completed. The rapid absorption, dose proportionality and favorable plasma half-life of ispronicline in these trials suggested the suitability of a once-daily dosing schedule. No safety issues were reportedly encountered and dose-specific enhancement of both direct and surrogate measures of memory and attention was observed. No differences in the quality of working memory factor were observed. Less pronounced improvements were observed in the 100-mg group compared to all other doses, indicative of a possible inverted U-dose response curve [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="615362"&gt;615362&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the single and multiple escalating-dose trials, ispronicline dose-dependently induced electrical brain activity characteristic of a nicotine agonist, and confirmed CNS penetration and activity, as observed by electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis. In addition, dose-specific effects were observed on direct and surrogate measures of memory in a computerized cognitive test battery [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="615362"&gt;615362&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In line with preclinical observations, the compound induced long-lasting cognitive enhancement for up to 48 h in elderly volunteers [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="592125"&gt;592125&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the single and multiple escalating-dose trials, EEG analysis showed that orally administered ispronicline caused a shift in relative and absolute power from lower to higher frequency bands, with similar effects observed in both trials on day 1 and in the multiple escalating-dose trial on day 10. No tolerance to ispronicline occurred over the 10-day dosing period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634416"&gt;634416&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the multiple escalating-dose trial in healthy volunteers, 10 days of dosing with ispronicline produced efficacy in the 'power of attention' measure of the cognitive drug research (CDR) test battery [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634952"&gt;634952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The 100-mg dose of ispronicline improved memory (notably immediate and delayed word recall) in volunteers, and a 200-mg dose improved picture and word recognition and enhanced vigilance [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634416"&gt;634416&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In elderly volunteers, pharmaco-EEG changes resembled those seen in younger individuals; the changes were of an acceleration type, with power shifting from low to high frequency bands. In CDR cognitive tests, significant differences between ispronicline and placebo on measures of immediate and delayed recall, picture recognition and quality of episodic memory were achieved. There was good correlation between plasma levels of the drug and pharmaco-EEG changes [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634416"&gt;634416&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Correlations of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data indicated that plasma Cmax values in the range 4 to 55 ng/ml were associated with greatest cognitive improvement; Cmax values in this range would be achieved with oral doses of 25 to 75 mg, levels at which ispronicline has tolerability equivalent to placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634952"&gt;634952&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIa/II study in an undisclosed number of AAMI patients (age &amp;gt; 60 years), a single dose of 80 mg of ispronicline was superior to placebo in terms of improving quality of episodic secondary memory factor score up to 48 h after dosing. After 3 weeks of treatment at 50 mg, significant improvements were observed in CDR measures of the power and continuity of attention, episodic memory and speed of thinking, compared with patients receiving placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="612281"&gt;612281&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634952"&gt;634952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Targacept reported that a phase II trial with ispronicline has been completed in elderly individuals with AAMI (n = 76). Positive effects on various aspects of cognition were observed and the drug was well tolerated at doses up to 150 mg [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="624033"&gt;624033&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although the data in AAMI patients are likely to pertain to this phase II trial, the stated age ranges differ between the published data and the ongoing trial.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Data were presented recently for the double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover phase II study of ispronicline in volunteers with MCI [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="641513"&gt;641513&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Volunteers (aged &amp;gt; 60 years) with MCI (mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score &gt;/- 24 and Wechsler memory scale-R, paired associate learning test score &gt;/- 1.5 standard deviations lower than age matched controls) were randomized into cohorts of 20 to sequentially receive 3 weeks oral treatment with 50 and 100 mg of ispronicline or placebo, with a 2-week washout between treatments. Cognitive assessment was performed at 0, 2 and 4 h post-dosing on the CDR test battery. No effect was observed with 50 mg of ispronicline (n = 19), at which placebo was superior to drug on measures of working memory and memory speed. The 100 mg dose of ispronicline (n = 17) was superior to placebo in the power of attention and episodic memory factors (p &amp;lt; 0.05), and on the working memory and speed of memory tests (p &amp;lt; 0.1). Analysis of data from both dose groups showed that ispronicline produced greater cognitive improvement in more severely impaired (MMSE 23 to 27) volunteers than those with lesser impairment (MMSE = 28 to 30). Ispronicline was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile at both doses [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="641513"&gt;641513&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial of ispronicline is ongoing in elderly individuals (aged 50 to 80 years) with AAMI. Recruitment has been completed (174 participants were expected), and the study is scheduled for completion in February 2006 [www.clinicaltrials.gov].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A further phase II trial is planned for mid-2006, and is designed to evaluate ispronicline as a monotherapy treatment for mild Alzheimer's disease or add-on therapy to approved medications for moderate Alzheimer's disease. Clinical development is also being considered for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia and following coronary artery bypass grafting, ADHD and certain forms of dementia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="624033"&gt;624033&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In summary, ispronicline was well tolerated and demonstrated cognitive enhancing effects in six phase I and II clinical trials (n = 200) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="611220"&gt;611220&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side effects and contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;In phase I/II studies assessing the effect of ispronicline on central activity and cognitive enhancement, adverse events were only detected at the maximum tolerated dose of ispronicline (150 mg in the elderly and 320 mg in the young). These included headache, dizziness and lightheadedness and occasional nausea/vomiting. These side effects were attributed to the central pharmacology of ispronicline, since these effects were not accompanied by changes in cardiovascular variables, as would be expected if peripheral nAChR inhibition were occurring [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="615362"&gt;615362&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In phase IIa/b trials, ispronicline had an effective dose of 50 to 100 mg, while no toxic effects were observed at 320 mg, suggesting a broad therapeutic window [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="541084"&gt;541084&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Ispronicline was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="612281"&gt;612281&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase II study of 50 or 100 mg ispronicline in volunteers with MCI, the drug was well tolerated at both doses. The most common adverse event was light-headedness. No significant effects were recorded on biochemical, hematological or urinary measures, vital signs or cardiac monitoring [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="641513"&gt;641513&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Patent summary&lt;/subtitle&gt;In January 2002, Targacept and &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="27779"&gt;Aventis Pharma SA&lt;/ulink&gt; published WO-00205798, a PCT application that covered salts of ispronicline and their use in the prevention or treatment of CNS disorders.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Four US patents (US-06432975, US-06624173, US-06440970 and US-06525065) relate to composition of matter of the chemical family of the hetero-aryl azabicyclo alkanes. In the composition patents, a broad application domain has been stated, including the treatment of other CNS conditions and disorders such as schizophrenia, in providing neuroprotection, the management of stroke and in treating patients susceptible to convulsions, depression, autism and certain neuroendocrine disorders.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;WO-2005037832 was published by Targacept in April 2005, and claims the use of ispronicline for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome, ADHD, schizophrenia, drug/nicotine addiction, pain and obesity. In addition, appropriately radiolabeled compounds are claimed for use as selective probes for nAChR subtypes in neuroimaging applications in US-06432975.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Specific stimulation of alpha4beta2 versus alpha7 nAChRs will likely lead to different effects on cognitive scales because of the differential distribution of nAChR subtypes (preferentially striatal-thalamic versus cortical), and differential sensitivity to pathological conditions (eg, Alzheimer's disease versus psychiatric diseases). In this regard, perhaps something can be learned from the clinical expertise gained from the study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7187"&gt;ABT-418&lt;/ulink&gt; (an nAChR agonist that was discontinued from development by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="13601"&gt;Abbott Laboratories&lt;/ulink&gt; in 2002 because of safety concerns) in a number of medical conditions involving lack of attention and cognitive deficits. The compounds have a similar profile in terms of their nAChR selectivity.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Interestingly, unlike &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7187"&gt;ABT-418&lt;/ulink&gt;, ispronicline produces a sustained cognitive effect in both preclinical and human models long after its clearance from the body. This prolonged action might be a result of changes in intracellular signaling, the nature of which is still unclear. At the maximal clinical tolerable dose, ispronicline will most probably also stimulate the alpha7 nAChR. For alpha7 nAChR-mediated neuroprotection against beta-amyloid, it has been shown that Janus kinase/Akt pathways are involved in intracellular activation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="621830"&gt;621830&lt;/ulink&gt;]. As a possible caveat, preclinical data suggest that while possibly reducing beta-amyloid pathology [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="622041"&gt;622041&lt;/ulink&gt;], in contrast long-term activation of nicotinic receptors in transgenic animals can exacerbate tau pathology [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="621828"&gt;621828&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Whether this is also the case for ispronicline is currently unknown.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The specific activation of neuronal nAChRs is advantageous because gastrointestinal side effects, such as vomiting and diarrhea, currently occur in many Alzheimer's disease patients during the titration phase of their treatment with AChE inhibitors, and are assumed to be related to peripheral muscarinic receptor activation. Nausea is a more typical nicotinic receptor-mediated side effect, and whether the effects are a consequence of central activity is still a matter for debate. In any case, no data have described the incidence of nausea in ispronicline-treated patients.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The clinical experience with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="9409"&gt;galantamine&lt;/ulink&gt; in Alzheimer's patients suggests a superior effect of nAChR modulators in enhancing attention [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="516203"&gt;516203&lt;/ulink&gt;] and working memory [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="622036"&gt;622036&lt;/ulink&gt;] over and above that attributable to AChE inhibition alone. In addition, specific behavioral improvements can be expected in agitation/aggression, anxiety, disinhibition and aberrant motor behaviors [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="622040"&gt;622040&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This is in line with the observed effects of ispronicline on CDR battery scales in cognitively impaired elderly individuals. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;This clinical effect is probably because the stimulation of nicotinic receptors, which diffusely project out of the nucleus basalis of Meynert and the pedunculopontine nucleus, modulates their activation in a large part of the brain. This is likely mediated by an increase in dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and even glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels. As a specific example, beta2-containing nAChR stimulation increases dopamine release in the striatum [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="636359"&gt;636359&lt;/ulink&gt;]. One could argue that increased dopamine release in a slightly deficient striatum could enhance the saliency of stimuli and positively influence reward stimuli. However, the specific nAChR subtype responsible for the other effects has not been identified in all cases, and specific questions remain regarding the kinetics of activation, desensitization and reactivation of the nAChRs responsible, resulting, for example, in spatial and temporal differences in excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABA modulation in complex interacting networks [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="621790"&gt;621790&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="621822"&gt;621822&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Whether this effect will be sufficient for pure nAChR agonists to improve cognitive scales such as the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) or MMSE is at present unknown. Computer simulation of a virtual synaptic cleft suggests that suboptimal AChE inhibition can be synergistically amplified by nicotinic receptor stimulation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="621742"&gt;621742&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This effect was illustrated in a number of in vivo preclinical studies in which a dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="9409"&gt;galantamine&lt;/ulink&gt; had similar or superior effects on behavior or neurophysiology, compared with an identical dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2992"&gt;donepezil&lt;/ulink&gt;, a pure AChE inhibitor [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="621831"&gt;621831&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="621833"&gt;621833&lt;/ulink&gt;], despite the fact that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2992"&gt;donepezil&lt;/ulink&gt; produces a 3- to 4-fold higher brain AChE inhibition under these conditions [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="621785"&gt;621785&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This suggests that the activation of nAChR through the combination of nAChR modulation with a low brain AChE inhibition can actually lead to the same (or even superior) behavioral or neurochemical changes as direct stimulation in the context of a much higher brain AChE inhibition.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;There is a high probability that ispronicline will be tested in combination with an AChE inhibitor during clinical development. Interestingly, such a combination with a suboptimal dose of an AChE inhibitor could lead to superior clinical efficacy on primary endpoints, such as ADAS-Cog, while simultaneously limiting the development of tolerance due to the upregulation of the AChE enzyme as a consequence of high-level continuous AChE inhibition [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="622031"&gt;622031&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, muscarinic receptor stimulation resulting from limited AChE inhibition can provide additional benefits for a number of behavioral problems, as suggested by the clinical experience with muscarinic M1 agonists (for a review, see reference [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="624153"&gt;624153&lt;/ulink&gt;]). In addition, muscarinic M1 receptor stimulation can provide neuroprotection against both amyloid and tau pathology beyond nicotine receptor activation (reviewed in reference [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="621786"&gt;621786&lt;/ulink&gt;]). As the intracellular pathways of both approaches differ, there may be the possibility of an additive or synergistic action.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Ispronicline is also currently in development for the treatment of pre-Alzheimer's conditions such as MCI and AAMI. A reactive upregulation of ACh-synthesizing enzymes has been documented in this patient population, probably as a consequence of dysfunctional cholinergic nerve terminals [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="622042"&gt;622042&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This upregulation might reduce the beneficial effect of direct nAChR stimulation by modulators such as ispronicline. In this regard, it is interesting to note that in terms of delaying the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, the clinical benefits of AChE inhibition in MCI patients are at best limited [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="622044"&gt;622044&lt;/ulink&gt;]. MCI and AAMI have not yet been recognized by the FDA as medical conditions, but the regulatory landscape might change substantially over the next few years.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An interesting development is the clinical proof-of-principle study of ispronicline as an add-on in the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. This study was carried out by the TURNS project, as presented at the 2005 International Conference on Schizophrenia Research [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="631107"&gt;631107&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although the neuropathology and genetics of schizophrenia suggest a specific alpha7 nAChR deficit in this case, a well-balanced modulation of both major brain nAChR subtypes, such as that provided by ispronicline, might be of great value.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In summary, the pharmacological profile and available data regarding ispronicline indicate that this compound may provide an interesting new mechanism for treating cognitive deficits in both schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Extrapolating from the preclinical data for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="9409"&gt;galantamine&lt;/ulink&gt;, a compound with a similar pharmacology (reviewed in reference [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="634638"&gt;634638&lt;/ulink&gt;]), in theory we can expect that ispronicline will combine symptomatic cognitive improvement with general neuroprotection against beta-amyloid pathology. We believe that the best effects will be observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease and when this drug is combined with a suboptimal dose of an AChE inhibitor.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="26249">Targacept Inc</Company><Country id="X5">Europe</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="DX"
