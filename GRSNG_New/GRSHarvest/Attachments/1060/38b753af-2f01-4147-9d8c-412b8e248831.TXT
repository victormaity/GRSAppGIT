In May 2016, the trial was also ongoing in Canada, Australia and the UK [&lt;ulink linkID="1734530" linkType="Reference"&gt;1734530&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2016, the trial was initiated in Taiwan [&lt;ulink linkID="1777930" linkType="Reference"&gt;1777930&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Also in June 2016, the trial was approved in Korea [&lt;ulink linkID="1731113" linkType="Reference"&gt;1731113&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2016, the enrollment of patients who had participated  in the MINDSET study was initiated in a 12-month open-label, extension study (&lt;ulink linkID="244163" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02586909&lt;/ulink&gt;; RVT-101-3002) in the US, Europe, Canada and Australia [&lt;ulink linkID="1788170" linkType="Reference"&gt;1788170&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1904532" linkType="Reference"&gt;1904532&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2017, recruitment in MINDSET was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1890886" linkType="Reference"&gt;1890886&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By April 2017,  the trial  had randomized 1315 patients  [&lt;ulink linkID="1916792" linkType="Reference"&gt;1916792&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By June 2017, the last patient vist had been anticipated in August 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1951015" linkType="Reference"&gt;1951015&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In Septmber 2017, negative topline results were reported showing that the trial did not meet its coprimary  endpoints. At 24 weeks, the change in cognition scoring from baseline was non-significantly improved in the intepirdine group compared with the placebo arm (0.36 ADAS-Cog points; p-value = 0.22). No difference between the intepirdine and placebo groups was observed  in the change in activities of daily living scoring from baseline  (0.09 ADCS-ADL points; p-value = 0.83). Of the endpoints analyzed by that time, the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change plus caregiver interview (CIBIC+), a  key secondary endpoint, had shown  significant improvement  (0.12  points; p-value = 0.02). At that time, the company planned to  work with investigators to conclude the MINDSET open-label extension study [&lt;ulink linkID="1965466" linkType="Reference"&gt;1965466&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2017, the company planned to keep the open-label extension  study of MINDSET open [&lt;ulink linkID="1977712" linkType="Reference"&gt;1977712&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January2018, the company planned to work with investigators to conclude the trial  [&lt;ulink linkID="1995955" linkType="Reference"&gt;1995955&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2015, the company planned to expand the drug's clinical program to include a Japanese registration study [&lt;ulink linkID="1685557" linkType="Reference"&gt;1685557&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2009, phase IIb data were presented for  intepirdine at the fourth annual Anglo-Swedish Medicinal Chemistry Symposium in Lund, Sweden.  In a 24-week trial (n = 371) intepirdine (5 to 35 mg) was compared with &lt;ulink linkID="2992" linkType="Drug"&gt;donepezil&lt;/ulink&gt;. At 35 mg intepirdine demonstrated significant improvements in global function in AD comparable to donepezil, as assessed by CIBIC+. Furthermore, at 35 mg intepirdine, the AD Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-Cog) score was comparable to donepezil. Despite there being some reports of headache, intepirdine was considered overall to be well tolerated at all doses [&lt;ulink linkID="997085" linkType="Reference"&gt;997085&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2015, data from the completer analysis of the trial were presented at the 2015 AAIC in Washington DC. Data demonstrated that intepirdine 35 mg dose was effective in improving cognition and function as an adjunct to stable donepezil at multiple time points. For the 15 mg intepirdine group, mean ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL and CDR-SB values were generally numerically superior to placebo but the differences were not statistically significant [&lt;ulink linkID="1678795" linkType="Reference"&gt;1678795&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2016, new data were presented at the 2016 Clinical Trials in Alzheimer's Disease meeting in San Diego, CA. Intepirdine treatment was associated with reduced progression in dependence indicating that patients who received the combination treatment spent more time in the earlier, less dependent stages of the disease [&lt;ulink linkID="1884171" linkType="Reference"&gt;1884171&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2008, a worldwide, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="19304" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00708552&lt;/ulink&gt;, AZ3110865) was planned in patients (expected n = 576) with mild to moderate AD. The patients were to receive either  intepirdine, donepezil, or a placebo. The primary endpoint was a change in cognition and function after 24 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="991616" linkType="Reference"&gt;991616&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2008, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="19701" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00710684&lt;/ulink&gt;,    AZ3110866) began in the US, Australia, Canada, Chile and Europe in patients (expected n = 672) with mild to moderate AD. The patients were to receive either a fixed dose of intepirdine added to existing donepezil treatment, or a placebo. The primary endpoint was a change in cognition and function after 24 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="991613" linkType="Reference"&gt;991613&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2011, data were presented at the 2011 AAIC in Paris, France. Compared to placebo, patients treated with 35 mg intepirdine showed a statistically significant treatment difference from baseline for AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), at week 24. In the clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes or the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status total score significant difference was not observed [&lt;ulink linkID="1210541" linkType="Reference"&gt;1210541&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2015, complete data from the 684-subject trial were presented at the 2015 Alzheimer's Association International Conference, in Washington DC. Compared to patients treated with donepezil alone, patients who received 35 mg intepirdine in combination with donepezil demonstrated statistically significant improvements in cognition and function at 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks. Consistent  significant improvements were observed across multiple analyses on the ADAS-cog and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living scale. Intepirdine was well-tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1679586" linkType="Reference"&gt;1679586&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in 6, 10 and 9% of patients in intepirdine 35 mg, 15 mg and placebo groups, respectively. At week 24, AEs included nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, fall, headache, nausea and cough were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="1678785" linkType="Reference"&gt;1678785&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2017, further efficacy data were presented at the 2017 AAIC in London, UK. Compared to donepezil + placebo group, intepirdine 35 mg + donepezil group had greater proportion of responders (defined as patients who experienced ADAS-cognitive improvement from baseline of &amp;gt;/= 3 or &amp;gt;/= 4 points) at all time points [&lt;ulink linkID="1946781" linkType="Reference"&gt;1946781&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data regarding difference in cognitive decline over 48 weeks were presented at the same conference. In placebo + donepezil and intepirdine 35 mg + donepezil groups, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale-cognitive decline (co-primary endpoint) over 48 weeks was 3.45 and 1.80 points, respectively (p = 0.024), with intepirdine treatment resulting in a 47.7% less cognitive decline than placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1946801" linkType="Reference"&gt;1946801&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the same conference, further efficacy data were presented. At week 12, 24, 36 and 48, the difference in treatment (intepirdine 35 mg  + donepezil mg versus placebo + donepezil) outcome of ADAS-cog was 1.30, 1.50, 1.21 and 1.64 (p = 0.006, 0.013, 0.057 and 0.024), respectively;  of ADCS-ADL was 1.72, 2.00, 1.93 and 1.94 (p = 0.019, 0.024, 0.038 and 0.068), respectively; and of CDR-SB was 0.30, 0.14, 0.19 and 0.06 (p = 0.018, 0.413, 0.336 and 0.787), respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1946613" linkType="Reference"&gt;1946613&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference.  In intepirdine 35 mg + donepezil mg and placebo + donepezil groups, drug-related serious AEs at week 24 were reported by 0 and &amp;lt; 1% of patients, respectively; and at week 48 by 0 and &amp;lt; 1% of patients, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1946598" linkType="Reference"&gt;1946598&lt;/ulink&gt;].  At the same conference, further data were presented. Based on the analysis of converting ADCS-ADL scores to dependence levels, an association between addition of intepirdine 35 mg to stable donepezil therapy and lower progression dependence over 48 weeks was observed compared to donepezil alone [&lt;ulink linkID="1946588" linkType="Reference"&gt;1946588&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data from the analytical framework estimating the effect of intepirdine + donepezil versus donepezil alone and prior studies of donepezil alone versus placebo alone were presented at the same conference. The projected ADAS-cog benefit of intepirdine 35 mg + donepezil versus placebo alone was approximately 4.2 points [&lt;ulink linkID="1946652" linkType="Reference"&gt;1946652&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2006, a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="664" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00348192&lt;/ulink&gt;; AZ3106242) was initiated in subjects (expected n = 200) with AD in Europe and Chile. The subjects were to receive intepirdine, donepezil, or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in cognition and function after 24 weeks  [&lt;ulink linkID="815889" linkType="Reference"&gt;815889&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2007, data from the trial were reported, showing that 15 to 35 mg of intepirdine induced a similar improvement in global function and cognitive function as 5 to 10 mg of donepezil [&lt;ulink linkID="860793" linkType="Reference"&gt;860793&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By April 2008, the study had been completed [&lt;ulink linkID="815889" linkType="Reference"&gt;815889&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2010, data from the trial were published.  Treatment differences versus placebo in adjusted mean CIBIC values at week 24 were - 0.27 for intepirdine versus - 0.37 for donepezil [&lt;ulink linkID="1230790" linkType="Reference"&gt;1230790&lt;/ulink&gt;].   &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2005, a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, phase IIa/b trial (&lt;ulink linkID="622" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00224497&lt;/ulink&gt;;  AZ3100603) was initiated in subjects (expected n = 380) with AD in Europe, South America, South Africa, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand. The subjects were to receive intepirdine for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in cognition and function after 24 weeks. The study was complete by February 2007 [&lt;ulink linkID="626582" linkType="Reference"&gt;626582&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2007, data from the trial were reported, showing that intepirdine significantly improved global function compared with placebo. The drug was generally well tolerated with few side effects [&lt;ulink linkID="860793" linkType="Reference"&gt;860793&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2008, further data were presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease in Chicago, IL. After 24 weeks treatment with 35 mg/kg intepirdine,   no improvement in cognition was observed [&lt;ulink linkID="933426" linkType="Reference"&gt;933426&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I Studies&lt;/subtitle&gt;By August 2016, a drug-drug interaction study of intepirdine and rosuvastatin had been completed.

Over the dosage range studied, intepirdine demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics and the average time to reach maximal concentration was 4 to 7 h and t1/2 was approximately 30 h. Steady state was reached within seven days on repeat dosing. Intepirdine showed no significant effects on cytochrome 3A4, 2D6 and 1A2 metabolic pathways, but exhibited modest inhibitory effects on cytochrome P2C9 in a cytochrome P450 interaction study [&lt;ulink linkID="1701886" linkType="Reference"&gt;1701886&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In  August  2007, an open-label, randomized, two-part crossover, phase I trial (&lt;ulink linkID="5357" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00551772&lt;/ulink&gt;; AZ3110291; presumed to be RVT-101-1001) was initiated in healthy elderly subjects (expected n = 12) in the US. The subjects were to receive single doses of intepirdine, administered as either a tablet or a capsule formulation. The primary endpoint was pharmacokinetic characterization of  intepirdine, assessed pre-dose to 96 h post treatment.  By October 2007, the  trial was ongoing but no longer recruiting  [&lt;ulink linkID="851974" linkType="Reference"&gt;851974&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1782105" linkType="Reference"&gt;1782105&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1783261" linkType="Reference"&gt;1783261&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2016, data were presented from the study at the 2016 AAIC in Toronto, Canada, showing that food did not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of intepirdine [&lt;ulink linkID="1782105" linkType="Reference"&gt;1782105&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1783261" linkType="Reference"&gt;1783261&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By December 2003, the compound had entered phase I trials [&lt;ulink linkID="515870" linkType="reference"&gt;515870&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2004, these trials were completed; intepirdine exhibited a safe and tolerable profile  [&lt;ulink linkID="626590" linkType="Reference"&gt;626590&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="626599" linkType="Reference"&gt;626599&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Other Studies&lt;/subtitle&gt;In January 2017, data from a drug-drug interaction study from healthy subjects were reported. No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions were observed between intepirdine and &lt;ulink linkID="3411" linkType="Drug"&gt;itraconazole&lt;/ulink&gt;  [&lt;ulink linkID="1890886" linkType="Reference"&gt;1890886&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2017,  results from a Through QT (TQT)   trial were reported. TQT study excluded significant QT interval prolongation following a supratherapeutic dose of intepirdine [&lt;ulink linkID="1890886" linkType="Reference"&gt;1890886&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Lewy body dementia&lt;/subtitle&gt;In October 2016, an interventional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term extension  phase IIb trial (&lt;ulink linkID="274880" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02928445&lt;/ulink&gt;; RVT-101-2002) of RVT-101 (35 microg and 70 microg) was initiated in the US, UK, Canada, 	France, Italy and Spain in dementia patients (expected n = 240) with lewy bodies  who had participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, lead-in study RVT-101-2001. In June 2017, the trial was expected to complete in March 2018; at that time, patient recruitment had been completed and top-line data were expected in the fourth quarter of 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1937218" linkType="Reference"&gt;1937218&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1937606" linkType="Reference"&gt;1937606&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2016, a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIb trial (&lt;ulink linkID="252260" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02669433&lt;/ulink&gt;; RVT-101-2001; HEADWAY-DLB) was initiated in the US in dementia patients (expected n = 240) with lewy bodies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intepirdine. The coprimary endpoint were the CIBIC-Plus and a computerized cognitive battery. The trial was expected to be completed in October 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1733756" linkType="Reference"&gt;1733756&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2017, information  about this trial trail was presented at the 13th International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease in Vienna, Austria. At that time, the trial was ongoing in the US, Canada, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the UK  [&lt;ulink linkID="1915199" linkType="Reference"&gt;1915199&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2017, enrollment was completed in the trial. At that time, the trial had enrolled a total of 269 patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1951015" linkType="Reference"&gt;1951015&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In Septmber 2017, data were expected at the end of 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1965466" linkType="Reference"&gt;1965466&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2018, Axovant reported that the trial did not meet its primary efficacy endpoints: a 2.01 point worsening (35 mg) and a 0.74 point improvement (70 mg) versus placebo in motor function, as measured by the UPDRS Part III; a 0.47 point worsening (35 mg) and a 0.67 point improvement (70 mg) versus placebo in cognition, as measured by ADAS-Cog; and 0.15 (35 mg) and  0.07 (70 mg) point improvements versus placebo in global function, as measured by CIBIC+, were reported. Significant effects were also not achieved in the computerized cognitive battery, with a a 0.38 worsening (35 mg) and a 0.36 (70 mg)  improvement noted compared with placebo. At that time, the company planned to work with investigators to conclude the trial  [&lt;ulink linkID="1995955" linkType="Reference"&gt;1995955&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Gait and balance in patients with dementia&lt;/subtitle&gt;In September 2016, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover phase II study (&lt;ulink linkID="272319" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02910102&lt;/ulink&gt;; RVT-101-2003) to assess the effect of RVT-101 on gait and balance in patients (expected n = 40) with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or Parkinson's disease dementia, was to begin in October 2016. At that time, the study was expected to compete in September 2017. In October 2016, the trial  was initiated in the US  [&lt;ulink linkID="1799025" linkType="Reference"&gt;1799025&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2018, the trial did not meet its primary endpoint and there was no improvement in gait speed [&lt;ulink linkID="1995955" linkType="Reference"&gt;1995955&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2017, in vivo data were presented at the 2017 AAIC in London, UK. In novel object recognition test, subchronic po administration of intepirdine (1.5 mg/kg, po) significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory consolidation deficits. In Morris water maze analysis with spatial task deficit aged rats, subchronic po administration of intepirdine (1.5 mg/kg, po) improved spatial learning performance. In passive avoidance paradigm, intepirdine (0.5 to 4.5 mg/kg, po) significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory consolidation deficits [&lt;ulink linkID="1946586" linkType="Reference"&gt;1946586&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further in vitro data were presented at the same conference. In rat primary neuronal cultures pretreated with intepirdine for 24 h, LDH release was decreased when exposed to oxygen/glucose deprivation  with 40% maximum reduction at 0.3 microM concentration. Intepirdine exhibited neuroprotective effects under hypoxic and hypoglycemic conditions [&lt;ulink linkID="1946566" linkType="Reference"&gt;1946566&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1946276" linkType="Reference"&gt;1946276&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2016, preclinical data were presented at the 2016 AAIC in Toronto, Canada. In 20 mg/kg of intepirdine dosing group a trend of increased metabolic activity was observed in several brain regions when compared with vehicle treated group, but no significant changes were observed between dosing groups. Harmful effects were also not observed [&lt;ulink linkID="1782129" linkType="Reference"&gt;1782129&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2015, preclinical data from a study evaluated the efficacy of RVT-101 and donepezil on extracellular neurotransmitters in the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus of conscious rats were presented at the Lewy Body Dementia Association's (LBDA) International Dementia with Lewy Bodies Conference in Fort Lauderdale, FL [&lt;ulink linkID="1733642" linkType="Reference"&gt;1733642&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2010,  data were presented for intepirdine at the 40th SFN Meeting in San Diego, CA. Young rats pretreated with vehicle failed to show a robust novel object preference in a 24 h delay novel object recognition test; a significant novel object preference was observed when rats were pretreated during the sample and choice test phases with intepirdine (10 mg/kg, po) [&lt;ulink linkID="1148002" linkType="Reference"&gt;1148002&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1144715" linkType="Reference"&gt;1144715&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2009, preclinical data were presented by &lt;ulink linkID="1009547" linkType="Company"&gt;sanofi-aventis&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="27434" linkType="Company"&gt;Memory Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt; at the 39th SFN meeting in Chicago, IL. Data showed the compound significantly enhanced memory deficits [&lt;ulink linkID="1048511" linkType="Reference"&gt;1048511&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1048507" linkType="Reference"&gt;1048507&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2009, data were presented at the fourth annual Anglo-Swedish Medicinal Chemistry Symposium in Lund, Sweden. The compound had  a pKi value of 9.6 at the 5-HT 6 receptor, it also displayed activity at the 5-HT 2A receptor (pKi = 8.0). It was a PgP substrate but showed high penetration. Compared with &lt;ulink linkID="17658" linkType="Drug"&gt;SB-258585&lt;/ulink&gt;, intepirdine demonstrated improved brain levels, good penetration, improved PgP, rat ex vivo binding at 0.3 mg/kg and high free fraction. No suitable position was available on intepirdine for PET labelling. Consequently, a competition analysis was performed with a closely related analog &lt;ulink linkID="60540" linkType="Drug"&gt;[11C]-GSK 215083&lt;/ulink&gt; in the presence of the 5HT2A antagonist &lt;ulink linkID="16474" linkType="Drug"&gt;ketanserin&lt;/ulink&gt;. The results confirmed the presence of significants levels of intepirdine in relevant regions of the brain [&lt;ulink linkID="997085" linkType="Reference"&gt;997085&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 2004, preclinical data showing that intepirdine was tolerated, and improved learning and memory in elderly rats when compared to a saline control, was presented.  The drug was also shown to displace radioligand binding to 5-HT6 receptors dose-dependently  in pig brain [&lt;ulink linkID="626599"
