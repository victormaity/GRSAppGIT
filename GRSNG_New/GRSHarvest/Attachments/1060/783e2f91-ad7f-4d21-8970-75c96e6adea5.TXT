linkID="13979" linkType="Company"&gt;Alexion Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt; has developed and launched eculizumab (Soliris; 5G1.1), an iv recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to human complement component C5 and inhibits its cleavage into C5a and C5b, thereby blocking formation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9, a mediator of intravascular hemolysis. The product is indicated in the US for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) to reduce hemolysis; for  the treatment of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA); for the treatment of adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody-positive; and, for   the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive  [&lt;ulink linkID="1553399" linkType="Reference"&gt;1553399&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the EU, it is indicated for the treatment of adults and children with PNH with and without a history of transfusions and aHUS; and for the treatment of refractory generalized MG in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive  [&lt;ulink linkID="1244231" linkType="Reference"&gt;1244231&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1549906" linkType="Reference"&gt;1549906&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1649309" linkType="Reference"&gt;1649309&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1954982" linkType="Reference"&gt;1954982&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In Japan, it is indicated for the treatment of PNH and for treating adult and pediatric patients with aHUS andf for the treatment of  patients with generalized MG who are AChR antibody-positive and whose symptoms are difficult to control with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy or plasmapheresis  [&lt;ulink linkID="1977976" linkType="Reference"&gt;1977976&lt;/ulink&gt;].    &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2007, eculizumab was launched in the US for PNH  [&lt;ulink linkID="989350" linkType="Reference"&gt;989350&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By October 2008, it had been launched throughout Europe  for PNH [&lt;ulink linkID="962314" linkType="Reference"&gt;962314&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in 2013, European approval was extended to include pediatric PNH patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1523716" linkType="Reference"&gt;1523716&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in April 2015, the EU label was updated to include the treatment of  PNH patients with high disease activity and without a history of transfusion [&lt;ulink linkID="1649309" linkType="Reference"&gt;1649309&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2010, the  product was launched in Japan for PNH [&lt;ulink linkID="1120105" linkType="Reference"&gt;1120105&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2011, eculizumab was launched in the US for aHUS in pediatric and adult patients following accelerated approval [&lt;ulink linkID="1227933" linkType="Reference"&gt;1227933&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in May 2014, the FDA approved an sBLA providing conversion from accelerated to regular approval [&lt;ulink linkID="1553147" linkType="Reference"&gt;1553147&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By October 2013, the drug was launched in the EU for aHUS in pediatric and adult patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1491805" linkType="Reference"&gt;1491805&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in April 2015, the EU label was update to include data supporting benefit of longer-term treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="1744999" linkType="Reference"&gt;1744999&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By  January 2015, the drug had been launched in Japan for aHUS [&lt;ulink linkID="1639634" linkType="Reference"&gt;1639634&lt;/ulink&gt;].   &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2017, the drug was approved in the EU for AChR antibody-positive, refractory generalized MG  [&lt;ulink linkID="1954982" linkType="Reference"&gt;1954982&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2017, the drug was approved in the US for adults  with AChR antibody-positive generalized MG [&lt;ulink linkID="1973730" linkType="Reference"&gt;1973730&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2017, the product was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with refractory generalized MG who are AChR antibody-positive  [&lt;ulink linkID="1993737" linkType="Reference"&gt;1993737&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2019, eculizumab was approved in the US for  the treatment of NMOSD in adult patients who are AQP4 antibody positive [&lt;ulink linkID="2168690" linkType="Reference"&gt;2168690&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2168854" linkType="Reference"&gt;2168854&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2018, an application  for the approval of eculizumab for NMOSD had been submitted in the  EU  [&lt;ulink linkID="2116603" linkType="Reference"&gt;2116603&lt;/ulink&gt;].  By April 2019, a regulatory filing had been  submitted in Japan for NMOSD; at that time, the application  was under review [&lt;ulink linkID="2145472" linkType="Reference"&gt;2145472&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Eculizumab is also  being developed for a number of other indications. By February 2012, a living-donor kidney transplant trial and a  deceased-donor kidney transplant trial in presensitized patients at elevated risk of acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)  had begun  [&lt;ulink linkID="1261528" linkType="Reference"&gt;1261528&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="1391320" linkType="Reference"&gt;1391320&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in September 2013, positive data from the deceased-donor trial were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="1475581" linkType="Reference"&gt;1475581&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in January 2015, negative data from the living-donor trial were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="1624907" linkType="Reference"&gt;1624907&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2015, Alexion expected approval in AMR by 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1639634" linkType="Reference"&gt;1639634&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2016, the company was developing plans for further trials in AMR patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1744999" linkType="Reference"&gt;1744999&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in February 2017, phase II development in AMR in presensitized renal transplant from deceased donor was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1901218" linkType="Reference"&gt;1901218&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By August 2014, a phase III trial for  delayed graft function after kidney transplantation began [&lt;ulink linkID="1587647" linkType="Reference"&gt;1587647&lt;/ulink&gt;]; negative data were reported in December 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1887759" linkType="Reference"&gt;1887759&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2017, an investigator-led, company-sponsored phase II trial was planned to be initiated in January 2018 in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH)  [&lt;ulink linkID="1978644" linkType="Reference"&gt;1978644&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2019, Alexion and Ochsner Health System  collaborated on a &lt;ulink linkID="20703" linkType="Company"&gt;Yale University&lt;/ulink&gt;-sponsored early phase I pilot trial of eculizumab to reduce preservation injury in human macrosteatotic liver transplantation in patients with end stage liver disease  [&lt;ulink linkID="2049370" linkType="Reference"&gt;2049370&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Eculizumab was also previously under development for other indications, including psoriasis and pemphigoid [&lt;ulink linkID="474093" linkType="Reference"&gt;474093&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, by October 2002,  the company was no longer pursuing development for those indications [&lt;ulink linkID="474129" linkType="Reference"&gt;474129&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Eculizumab was also  under development for systemic lupus erythematosus [&lt;ulink linkID="325861" linkType="Reference"&gt;325861&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no further development has been reported for that indication since October 1999. The company was also developing eculizumab for the potential treatment of other chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), membranous and lupus nephritis and dermatomyositis  [&lt;ulink linkID="190673" linkType="Reference"&gt;190673&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="292328" linkType="Reference"&gt;292328&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="474093" linkType="Reference"&gt;474093&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="474094" linkType="Reference"&gt;474094&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2002, an early-stage clinical trial was proceeding in dermatomyositis [&lt;ulink linkID="470328" linkType="Reference"&gt;470328&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2002, eculizumab was in phase II trials for the potential treatment of lupus nephritis [&lt;ulink linkID="473178" linkType="Reference"&gt;473178&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2005, phase II trials in membranous nephritis and RA were ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="603422" linkType="Reference"&gt;603422&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2008, the company was preparing trials of the drug in a variety of  hematological disorders including antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS)  [&lt;ulink linkID="962314" linkType="Reference"&gt;962314&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2009, the drug was in investigator-sponsored phase II studies for multifocal motor neuropathy [&lt;ulink linkID="989350" linkType="Reference"&gt;989350&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later in February 2009, the drug was in phase II trials for  type 2 membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (dense deposit disease) [&lt;ulink linkID="989350" linkType="Reference"&gt;989350&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In July 2009, a phase II trial of iv eculizumab in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) began [&lt;ulink linkID="1088227" linkType="Reference"&gt;1088227&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however since that time, no further development has been reported for those indications. By July 2011, a phase II/III trial for Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) had been initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="1216398" linkType="Reference"&gt;1216398&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in April 2012, Alexion expected to file an sBLA for STEC-HUS in 2H12[&lt;ulink linkID="1284554" linkType="Reference"&gt;1284554&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in  February 2014, additional  data from an epidemiological  study in approximately 400  STEC-HUS patients were being obtained and analyzed [&lt;ulink linkID="1523716" linkType="Reference"&gt;1523716&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no further development has been reported. Eculizumab was previously being developed for Guillain Barre syndrome and cold agglutinin disease. In August 2015, a phase II study was  initiated in patients with Guillain Barre syndrome [&lt;ulink linkID="1677639" linkType="Reference"&gt;1677639&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2011, a phase II study in patients with  cold agglutinin disease began [&lt;ulink linkID="1310753" linkType="Reference"&gt;1310753&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no further development has since been reported.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><PatentsAndGenerics><displayLabel>Patents and Generics</displayLabel><value>&lt;PatentsAndGenerics&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;The product patent &lt;ulink linkID="PA3007335" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-06355245&lt;/ulink&gt; is a continuation of the parent patent &lt;ulink linkID="IN2724655" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-06074642&lt;/ulink&gt;, which expired May 2, 2014, and takes its effective filing date from that patent. The expiry date of &lt;ulink linkID="PA3007335" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-06355245&lt;/ulink&gt;, March 12, 2019, is the constraining date for eculizumab, as the parent patent only claims a method of use [&lt;ulink linkID="617127" linkType="Reference"&gt;617127&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In February 2012, Alexion stated that it had been issued a US patent that would expire in 2021, including a patent term extension [&lt;ulink linkID="1267170" linkType="Reference"&gt;1267170&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Regulatory data exclusivity expired in March 2019 and Orphan Drug exclusivity for aHUS expired in 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1744999" linkType="Reference"&gt;1744999&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2117470" linkType="Reference"&gt;2117470&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2016, Alexion noted that the composition of matter patent would protect the drug until 2020 and 2021 in its major territories [&lt;ulink linkID="1790577" linkType="Reference"&gt;1790577&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2017, the USPTO issued three additional patents, &lt;ulink linkID="PA9164219" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-09732149&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkID="PA8866264" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-09718880&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="PA9125837" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-09725504&lt;/ulink&gt;, which cover the composition of matter of eculizumab,  pharmaceutical formulations of eculizumab and methods of treating PNH, expiring in 2027.

An analysis comparing data from 79 PNH patients treated with eculizumab for up to eight years (mean 39 months) with an age- and gender-matched normal population-based data, demonstrated comparable survival rates between eculizumab-treated patients and the normal population. There were fewer thrombotic events in the eculizumab arm, with 34 thrombotic episodes occurring in 21 patients prior to treatment. Of 64 patients treated with eculizumab for at least one year, 66% became transfusion-independent for more than 12 months; the remaining 34% demonstrated a significant 41% reduction in the mean units transfused [&lt;ulink linkID="1154353" linkType="Reference"&gt;1154353&lt;/ulink&gt;].

A total of 137 patients were continuing to receive eculizumab. Improved survival was reported for eculizumab-treated patients in the study compared with published historical control data. Of the 117 patients who were transfused in the 12 months prior to eculizumab treatment, 65.8% (77 patients) became transfusion-independent. In addition, a reduction in the number of transfusions required in the remaining 40 patients from a median of 26 units prior to treatment to 8 units in past 12 months was observed [&lt;ulink linkID="1346761" linkType="Reference"&gt;1346761&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2010, clinical data  were presented at the 52nd ASH meeting in Orlando, FL.  Thirty six-month efficacy data from a multicenter study that included 195 patients from the pilot, phase III trials and subsequent extension studies, were presented. Patients were treated with eculizumab for up to 5.5 years at a median of 29 months. Within one week, hemolysis was reduced in all patients treated with eculizumab and was sustained throughout the treatment period. Overall survival was 97.6%. Thromboembolic events were reduced by 81%, from 52 pre-treatment events to 10 events.

In December 2012, clinical data were presented at the 54th ASH Meeting in Atlanta, GA. By June 2012, a total of 1547 patients had been enrolled and 1047 patients were eligible for analysis. At that time, the trial had been expanded to  25 countries. During a mean follow-up period of 22.5 months, 16 patients had experienced a thromboembolism and 51 patients had died. The cumulative incidence of thromboembolism at 1 and 2 years in eculizumab-treated patients was 0.41 and 1.35%, respectively, compared with 1.70 and 2.61% in patients not receiving eculizumab. In addition, the cumulative incidence of mortality at 1 and 2 years in eculizumab-treated patients was 2.31 and 4.21%, respectively, compared with 4.40 and 7.01% in untreated patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1346769" linkType="Reference"&gt;1346769&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2017, further patient-reported outcomes data were presented at the 22nd EHA Annual Congress in Madrid, Spain. In all patients and patients aged &amp;lt; 25, 25 to 65, and &amp;gt; 65 years, mean changes in FACIT-fatigue scores were 5.2, 5.1, 6.0 and 1.6, respectively; and in Karnofsky scores were 8.4, 11.0, 8.3 and 7.2, respectively. Mean changes in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire-C30 global health/QoL score was 15.1, in physical functioning was 9.5, in role functioning was 16.3, in emotional functioning was 12.1, in social functioning was 13.9, and in cognitive functioning was 8.7 [&lt;ulink linkID="1939363" linkType="Reference"&gt;1939363&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data in PNH patients with or without high disease activity (HDA) were presented at the same conference. Significant decrease of LDH and reduction of thrombosis and MAVE event was observed. In HAD eculizumab treated group, reduction of transfused RBCs were highest [&lt;ulink linkID="1939324" linkType="Reference"&gt;1939324&lt;/ulink&gt;].   In December 2017, further safety data were presented at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in Atlanta, GA. In both eculizumab-treated and -untreated groups, the estimated rates of overall infection per 100 patient-years were similar (6.55 and 6.28 events/100 patient-years, respectively). During follow-up, treated group had substantially lower estimated rates of overall malignancy and solid tumors compared to untreated group (overall malignancy: 1.38 and 3.38 events/100 patient-years, respectively; solid tumors: 0.84 and 2.61 events/100 patient-years, respectively). In a subset of 632 patients in untreated group who later started eculizumab, the estimated rate of malignancy was lower [&lt;ulink linkID="1988632" linkType="Reference"&gt;1988632&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data  in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and high disease activity with or without history of aplastic anemia (AA) were presented at the same conference. Of 769 patients’ enrolled in the International PNH registry, 286 had a history of AA at initiation of eculizumab and 483 patients had no history of any AA. In both patients groups’ eculizumab treatment resulted in substantial decreases in RBC transfusion rates (3.6 and 1.8 units per 100 patients, respectively). In patients with eculizumab treatment significantly reduced mean LDH from baseline (history of AA group, -4.6; no history of group, -5.8; p &amp;lt; 0.0001), increased mean hemoglobin levels from baseline (history of AA group, 11.7; no history of group, 14.7; p &amp;lt; 0.0001), regardless of AA history at treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="1988519" linkType="Reference"&gt;1988519&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, further clinical data were presented at the 23rd EHA Annual Congress in Stockholm, Sweden. In patients with a history of RBC transfusion (n = 469), the rate of transfusions were decreased by 50 and 70% during the 12 months after initiation of eculizumab, and during period between initiation eculizumab and last treated follow-up, respectively, as compared with the year prior to initiation of eculizumab (both p &amp;lt; 0.01).  In patients without a history of RBC transfusion (n = 426), low rates of RBC transfusions were observed during both the 12 months after eculizumab initiation and during the period between initiation of eculizumab and last treated follow-up. In both groups, the rate of thrombotic events decreased by 70% after eculizumab treatment was initiated as compared with the prior from disease start to initiation of eculizumab; results were similar with all major adverse vascular events. There were significant reductions in complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis and occurrence of thrombotic events after initiation of eculizumab, regardless of prior transfusion history or BMD status [&lt;ulink linkID="2045554" linkType="Reference"&gt;2045554&lt;/ulink&gt; ]. Further clinical data were presented at the same conference. Eculizumab led to substantial reduction in intravascular hemolysis in all three cohorts, as defined by LDH ratio, with no significant between-group differences observed in adjusted mean change from baseline in LDH ratio (cohort 1 versus 2, p = 0.97; cohort 1 versus 3, p = 0.86, cohort 2 versus 3, p = 0.88). Treatment with Eculizumab resulted in substantial decrease in rates of thrombotic events.

A total 33 patients with aHUS and 27 with secondary thrombotic microangiopathy received eculizumab. In patients with complement mediated aHUS, after receiving eculizumab, 67.9% of patients achieved TMA event-free status, 56.5% achieved platelet count normalization, 27.8% achieved complete TMA response, 54.5% achieved LDH normalization and 57.1 % achieved serum creatinine decrease &amp;gt;/= 25%. Of 11 adverse reactions reported in patients with secondary TMA, 8 reported serious [&lt;ulink linkID="2085184" linkType="Reference"&gt;2085184&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;n April 2012, a postmarketing registry (&lt;ulink linkID="162026" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01522183&lt;/ulink&gt;; M11-001) was opened in the US to assess the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in patients with aHUS (expected n = 2000). The study was expected to complete in December 2025 [&lt;ulink linkID="1310792" linkType="Reference"&gt;1310792&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2016, clinical data which evaluated the need for dialysis were presented at ASN's Kidney Week 2016 in Chicago, IL. Fewer cumulative proportion of patients treated pre-transplant with eculizumab required dialysis compared to patients treated post-transplant. In patients treated pre-transplant and post-transplant, chronic dialysis was required by 3 and 11 patients with incidence rate of 1.5 and 3.0/100 patient-years, respectively; and acute dialysis by 3 and 18 patients with incidence rate of 1.5 and 4.9/100 patient-years, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1876280" linkType="Reference"&gt;1876280&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2018, further real-world data were presented at the 2018 ASN Kidney Week in San Diego, CA. Patients who were on eculizumab showed a lower thrombotic microangiopathy rate (120 events) versus patients who were never treated (301 events) and patients who discontinued treatment (7 events; 3.6, 27.5 and 10.7 per 100 patient-years, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkID="2085104" linkType="Reference"&gt;2085104&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2012, an observational study  (&lt;ulink linkID="162015" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01522170&lt;/ulink&gt;; C11-003) began in the US to assess the long-term efficacy of eculizumab in patients with aHUS who had completed a previous study (n = 150). The primary endpoint was TMA complication-free survival, with a secondary endpoint of long-term safety. The study was expected to complete in September 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1310791" linkType="Reference"&gt;1310791&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2014, clinical data were presented  from a sub-analysis of an open-label, single-arm study at the ASN Kidney Week 2014 in Philadelphia, PA.										In dialysis and non-dialysis patients, eculizumab significantly improved platelet count and improved estimated  glomerular filtration rate. A similar proportion of baseline dialysis and non-dialysis patients were dialysis-free at week 26 [&lt;ulink linkID="1614696" linkType="Reference"&gt;1614696&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In December 2015, (pre)clinical data were presented at the 57th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in Orlando, FL. TMA event rate was 63% lower during ON therapy when compared with OFF therapy. Patients with OFF therapy experienced serious adverse events. TMA events were higher in patients with identified genetic mutations when compared with patients with no mutations. Eculizumab was well tolerated. Serious targeted treatment-emergent adverse events were observed in similar rates in patients with ON and OFF therapy. Overall, one patient died due to severe intensive care complications and severe multi-organ failure [&lt;ulink linkID="1718857" linkType="Reference"&gt;1718857&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Myasthenia Gravis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2016, the EMA's PDCO agreed a pediatric investigation plan (PIP) for eculizumab for treatment of myasthenia gravis [&lt;ulink linkID="1735410" linkType="Reference"&gt;1735410&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In June 2018, the EMA's Pediatric Committee adopted a positive opinion on modifications to a PIP for eculizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis [&lt;ulink linkID="2048363" linkType="Reference"&gt;2048363&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Postmarketing&gt;</value></Postmarketing><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2017, a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, switch, phase III  study (&lt;ulink linkID="288527" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT03056040&lt;/ulink&gt;; A LXN1210-PNH-302; 2016-002026-36) was planned to begin in Canada, Europe, Japan and South Korea to assess ravulizumab given iv every 8 weeks in patients with PNH (expected n = 192) who are clinically stable on eculizumab therapy for at least 6 months. At that time, enrollment was expected to complete in 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1901042" linkType="Reference"&gt;1901042&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1957457" linkType="Reference"&gt;1957457&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2017, the trial was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="1957457" linkType="Reference"&gt;1957457&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By October 2017, enrollment had been completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1974988" linkType="Reference"&gt;1974988&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2018, positive topline data from the trial were reported. Data demonstrated non-inferiority of ravulizumab to eculizumab in patients with PNH who had been stable on eculizumab based on the primary endpoint of change in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In all four key secondary endpoints, non-inferiority was observed; the proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, the change from baseline in quality of life as assessed via the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale, the proportion of patients avoiding transfusion, and the proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin levels. Further, data showed that all five endpoints favored ravulizumab and was found to be well tolerated. In the study, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody for ravulizumab (versus one was observed for eculizumab) and neutralizing antibodies were not detected and observed no apparent effects on efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, or pharmacodynamics. In both the groups, no cases of meningococcal infection were reported. At that time, similar data were expected to be presented at a future medical congress   [&lt;ulink linkID="2028162" linkType="Reference"&gt;2028162&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2018, further data were presented at the 60th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in San Diego, CA. With all point estimates, ravulizumab was statistically significantly noninferior to eculizumab for the primary (hemolysis, as measured by percentage change in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level from baseline to day 183) and all key secondary endpoints: percentage change in LDH levels (difference = -9.21%), breakthrough hemolysis (difference = -5.1), change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score (difference = 1.47), transfusion avoidance (difference = 5.5) and hemoglobin stabilization-S (difference = 1.4). In contrast, superiority testing of the primary endpoint (percentage change in LDH) did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0583 versus p &amp;lt; 0.05 required) [&lt;ulink linkID="2098514" linkType="Reference"&gt;2098514&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2016, a  26-week, open-label, multinational, active-controlled, registration, phase III study (&lt;ulink linkID="277266" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02946463&lt;/ulink&gt;; ALXN1210-PNH-301; 2016-002025-1) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ravulizumab given iv every 8 weeks compared with eculizumab in complement inhibitor treatment-naive patients (n = 246, Taiwan n = 18) with PNH, was initiated in the US, Argentina, Australia, Europe, Brazil, Canada , Colombia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, Thailand and Turkey. The primary endoints were normalization of LDH levels and precentage of patients who achieved transfusion avoidance (TA) [&lt;ulink linkID="1867412" linkType="Reference"&gt;1867412&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1867539" linkType="Reference"&gt;1867539&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By January 2017, recruitment had been started in Taiwan [&lt;ulink linkID="1894200" linkType="Reference"&gt;1894200&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By October 2017, enrollment had been completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1974988" linkType="Reference"&gt;1974988&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2018, the study was expected to complete in January 2020 [&lt;ulink linkID="1867539" linkType="Reference"&gt;1867539&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2018, topline data were reported from 246 enrolled patients showing that the trial met its co-primary endpoints for non-inferiority across both co-primary and all key secondary endpoints. TA was achieved by 73.6% of patients treated with ravulizumab compared with 66.1% in the eculizumab treatment group. Further, 53.6% of patients treated with ravulizumab obtained LDH normalization versus 49.4% treated with eculizumab [&lt;ulink linkID="2014355" linkType="Reference"&gt;2014355&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, further results were presented at the 23rd EHA Annual Congress in Stockholm, Sweden. Point estimates favored ravulizumab for the percentage change in least squares mean LDH levels (76.8% versus 76.0% reduction from baseline), change in FACIT-Fatigue score (7.1 versus 6.4 point improvement from baseline) and the percentage of patients with breakthrough hemolysis (4.0% versus 10.7%) and hemoglobin stabilization (68.0% versus 64.5%). By end of first infusion of ravulizumab, there was an immediate, complete and sustained inhibition of C5 (mean free C5 &amp;lt; 0.5 microg/ml). Headache was the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse event [&lt;ulink linkID="2046099" linkType="Reference"&gt;2046099&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2018, further data were presented at the 60th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in San Diego, CA. Irrespective of prior packed RBC transfusion history and baseline LDH levels as well as nearly all other demographic subgroups, the treatment effect favored ravulizumab. Across each of the key secondary endpoints, point estimates favored ravulizumab: out of 17 subgroups, 8 on the assessment of percent change in LDH, 12 on the assessment of change in FACIT-Fatigue score, 13 on the assessment of breakthrough hemolysis and 13 on the assessment of hemoglobin stabilization [&lt;ulink linkID="2098184" linkType="Reference"&gt;2098184&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The EXPLORE trial was initiated in June 2006 to examine the frequency of PNH in patients with aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic  syndrome (MDS) and other bone marrow disorders; the trial was designed to enroll 2000 patients [&lt;ulink linkID="674062" linkType="Reference"&gt;674062&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2007,  data from patients with AA and MDS in the SHEPHERD and TRIUMPH trials were presented at the 43rd ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL. Data from the  trials in patients with a history of MDS or AA were pooled and analyzed. Hemolysis was  reduced by 84% and units of packed red blood cells transfused was significantly reduced from 7 to 0 units. Transfusion independence was achieved by 56% of patients; fatigue and quality of life measures were also significantly improved and sustained [&lt;ulink linkID="796132" linkType="Reference"&gt;796132&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="797174" linkType="Reference"&gt;797174&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In  May 2009, clinical data were presented at the 45th ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL.

The subjects who had been on placebo in the TRIUMPH study were crossed over to receive 600 mg eculizumab iv once weekly for four doses, followed by a single 900 mg dose, and then 900 mg doses on alternate weeks for up to 50 doses, while those who had been on  drug  received it every other week at visits 1 and 3 and placebo on weeks 2 and 4, followed by 900 mg drug weekly for 53 weeks. Patients who had been on SHEPHERD  were administered 900 mg eculizumab on alternate weeks for 53 weeks. The primary endpoint was treatment-emergent adverse events [&lt;ulink linkID="854852" linkType="Reference"&gt;854852&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2007, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1168509" linkType="Reference"&gt;1168509&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2005, a phase III extension trial (&lt;ulink linkID="31479" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00122317&lt;/ulink&gt;; E05-001) began that would enroll 187 patients from the TRIUMPH, SHEPHERD, or X03-001 studies, who would receive 600 mg of eculizumab every week x 4 then 900 mg of eculizumab every 2 weeks, or 600 mg of eculizumab x 4 every week then 900 mg of eculizumab every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was adverse events, and the secondary endpoints were thrombosis incidence, hemolysis and quality-of-life. The trial was completed in October 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="980245" linkType="Reference"&gt;980245&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Results from the extension study were presented at the 49th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA in December 2007; 187 patients were treated over a median of 22 months. Clinical benefits  were sustained throughout the treatment period. Hemolysis was reduced from a median of 2165 U/L at baseline to 274 U/L at 18 months, and 277 U/L at 54 months. Transfusion requirements decreased from a median of 8 units (mean 8.7) during the 6 months pretreatment  to 0 units (mean 3.3) during the first month and 0 (mean 2.8) during the most recent 6 months of eculizumab. Reduction in hemolysis was predictive of improvement in fatigue. Improvements in global health, patient functioning, pain and dyspnea continued, and reduction of thromboembolism with eculizumab was maintained; the thromboembolism event rate was reduced 90% from 12.53 to 1.31 events/100 patient years. Eculizumab was well tolerated; rates of infection-related AEs and serious AEs were similar for the first 6 months  and most recent 6 months. The most common AEs were headache (55%), nasopharyngitis (46%) and upper respiratory tract infection (40%). SAEs were reported by 33% of patients [&lt;ulink linkID="856747" linkType="Reference"&gt;856747&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2005, the treatment phase of the SHEPHERD phase III trial began. This open-label, non-placebo-controlled, multicenter, 12-month study enrolled 75 patients in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia, and followed patients  for a second 6-month period after initial results and then in an extension trial [&lt;ulink linkID="578939" linkType="Reference"&gt;578939&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2005, enrollment had been completed [&lt;ulink linkID="624357" linkType="Reference"&gt;624357&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2006, 6-month interim data from the SHEPHERD trial were reported. All prespecified primary and secondary endpoints were met with statistical significance. The primary efficacy endpoint was intravascular hemolysis; this was significantly decreased and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was reduced by 87% compared to baseline after 26 weeks treatment. The secondary endpoint, improvement in quality of life, was also met. Eculizumab was safe and well tolerated, and the most frequent adverse events were headache, nasopharyngitis and nausea [&lt;ulink linkID="672989" linkType="Reference"&gt;672989&lt;/ulink&gt;].  The  last patient completed the final visit in this study in October 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="737252" linkType="Reference"&gt;737252&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2006, extensive data on the SHEPHERD trial  were presented at the  48th ASH meeting in Orlando, FL.  The 52-week study recruited 97 patients (median duration of PNH =  4.9 years) to receive  600 mg eculizumab via iv infusion every 7 days for 4 doses, then 900 mg eculizumab 7 days later, followed by 900 mg every 14 days for  52 weeks. Primary endpoints included AEs  and intravascular hemolysis. Most AEs (96.3%) were mild to moderate. The most frequent AEs were headache, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection    (observed in 52.6, 32.0 and 29.9% of patients, respectively); only headache, pyrexia and myalgia were increased relative to placebo in the 6-month analysis. In total, 44 SAEs occurred, although none were considered probably or definitely related to the drug; possible drug-associated SAEs included pyrexia (2), abdominal distension (1), anxiety (1), headache (1), renal impairment (1) and viral infection (1);   infections in patients treated with eculizumab were generally mild to moderate, and 91.3% were classified as unrelated to study medication). The primary efficacy endpoint, LDH, was significantly reduced (269 U/l) compared with pretreatment levels (2051 U/l). Overall transfusion requirements decreased from a median of 8.0 packed RBC units/patient 1-year pretreatment to a median of 0 units 1-year post-dose;   51% of treated patients were transfusion independent for the entire period. A significant improvement in fatigue scale scores were observed within 1 week and sustained over  the period of treatment. Improvement in global health status was observed, as well as improvements in all five  functioning scales and  most symptom scales (seven of nine) [&lt;ulink linkID="746876" linkType="Reference"&gt;746876&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In January 2006, results from the TRIUMPH trial were reported. Patients received either placebo or eculizumab iv; eculizumab was given at a dose of 600 mg weekly for 4 weeks, followed 1 week later by a 900 mg dose and then 900 mg every other week until week 26. A final figure of 87 PNH patients had been enrolled at 45 sites worldwide. TRIUMPH met all primary and secondary endpoints with statistical significance; secondary endpoints included LDH reduction and improvement in quality of life. Over 6 months, median transfusion rates decreased from 10 to 0 units/patient. Hemoglobin stabilization occurred in 49% of eculizumab-treated patients compared with 0% for placebo. Secondary endpoints achieved were a reduction in LDH, an improvement in quality of life  and transfusion avoidance. Eculizumab was well tolerated with an AE profile similar to placebo.The most common adverse events were headache, nasopharyngitis and back pain [&lt;ulink linkID="647054" linkType="Reference"&gt;647054&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="692213" linkType="Reference"&gt;692213&lt;/ulink&gt;].

All observed eculizumab concentrations from trough and peak  samples were within the predicted values [&lt;ulink linkID="1242063" linkType="Reference"&gt;1242063&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2012, further data presumed to be from the study were presented at the 17th Congress of the EHA in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Eculizumab resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in LDH levels, from a mean baseline level of 1,020 U/l to within the normal range by week 2 of treatment  [&lt;ulink linkID="1301704" linkType="Reference"&gt;1301704&lt;/ulink&gt;]; further data were presented at the same conference. At week 12, mean standard deviation trough plasma eculizumab concentration was 214.5 microg/ml, within a range of 124.2 to 321.1 microg/ml. Eculizumab was well-tolerated. The pharmacodynamic and safety profile of eculizumab was consistent with that previously reported in adult patients with PNH [&lt;ulink linkID="1304678" linkType="Reference"&gt;1304678&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2008, dosing began in the 12-week AEGIS study, a Japanese, open label phase II trial that aimed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacology of  eculizumab in approximately 25 PNH patients [&lt;ulink linkID="865354" linkType="Reference"&gt;865354&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2008, enrollment had been completed, with a total of 29 patients included in the study [&lt;ulink linkID="888291" linkType="Reference"&gt;888291&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The study was completed in October 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="989350" linkType="Reference"&gt;989350&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2008, clinical data were presented at the 50th ASH meeting in San Francisco, CA; the trial achieved the primary endpoint of hemolysis reduction, with a subsequent reduction in anemia resulting in 67% of patients becoming transfusion independent [&lt;ulink linkID="968025" linkType="Reference"&gt;968025&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2009, further results reported that change in hemolysis was achieved with an 86% reduction, and that improvement in fatigue and reduction in transfusions  were also achieved. The drug was safe and well tolerated, with most adverse events  mild to moderate in severity; most frequent reported were headache, nasopharyngitis and nausea  [&lt;ulink linkID="997144" linkType="Reference"&gt;997144&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2009, further data were presented at the 51st ASH meeting in New Orleans, LA, from the 26-week extension study, which was ongoing at that time. After 38 weeks  treatment, all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), a clinical consequence of chronic hemolysis, either stabilized or improved.   Eculizumab was also associated with a sustained reduction in hemolysis [&lt;ulink linkID="1062492" linkType="Reference"&gt;1062492&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2010, further data were presented at the 15th EHA meeting in Barcelona, Spain. Eculizumab inhibition of terminal complement activation improved fatigue, dyspnea and other significant morbidities of PNH, independent of anemia [&lt;ulink linkID="1107806" linkType="Reference"&gt;1107806&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1107967" linkType="Reference"&gt;1107967&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2011, data were presented at the 16th Congress of the EHA in London, UK. Two patients with no history of transfusion showed reductions in LDH and CKD and improvement in fatigue and quality of life after treatment with eculizumab [&lt;ulink linkID="1199373" linkType="Reference"&gt;1199373&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2008, clinical data were presented at the 50th ASH meeting in San Francisco, CA; alternate dosing regimens were well tolerated and could be used in PNH patients in which complement inhibition is not consistently maintained [&lt;ulink linkID="968045" linkType="Reference"&gt;968045&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2002, a phase I trial was initiated in patients with PNH. The trial, designed to evaluate safety and activity, was to enroll 10 patients at two sites in the UK [&lt;ulink linkID="453972" linkType="Reference"&gt;453972&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2002, Alexion had substantially completed the 3-month treatment pilot study  [&lt;ulink linkID="473178" linkType="Reference"&gt;473178&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Data presented at the 44th ASH meeting, in Philadelphia, PA, in December 2002, showed that treatment with eculizumab abolished hemolysis. A dose of 600 mg was administered by iv infusion over 30 min once a week for 4 weeks, then 900 mg every other week. Response data for six of the 10 patients showed no SAEs and no incidence of thrombosis. The best response was observed in three patients who showed a mean increase in mean hemoglobin from 9.4  to 10.3  g/dl at 4 weeks without transfusion [&lt;ulink linkID="473085" linkType="Reference"&gt;473085&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2003, final results from the trial were presented at the 45th ASH meeting in San Diego, CA. A total of 11 patients from the initial study entered an extension trial of 900mg eculizumab by iv infusion over 30 min every other week for 1 year. Mean LDH decreased from 3111 U/l over the 12 months prior to treatment to 670 U/l over 6 months following treatment. Hemoglobinuria decreased from 3.0 to 0.2 paroxysms/patient/month since starting eculizumab therapy, with a significant improvement in quality of life measures related to hemolysis [&lt;ulink linkID="516029" linkType="Reference"&gt;516029&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar results from this study were subsequently published and presented [&lt;ulink linkID="521050" linkType="Reference"&gt;521050&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="533705" linkType="Reference"&gt;533705&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="610124" linkType="Reference"&gt;610124&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="610159" linkType="Reference"&gt;610159&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="638660" linkType="Reference"&gt;638660&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2012, a clinical trial application was filed in China, presumably for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH); in April 2016, review of the application was concluded but the outcome was not published [&lt;ulink linkID="1940143" linkType="Reference"&gt;1940143&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2017, another clinical trial application was filed in China [&lt;ulink linkID="1934550" linkType="Reference"&gt;1934550&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in July 2017, the application was granted Priority Review in China [&lt;ulink linkID="1944293" linkType="Reference"&gt;1944293&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Other studies&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2017, data from a study performed to evaluate the efficacy of eculizumab, in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was presented at 59th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in Atlanta, GA. A total of 54 patients received eculizumab. The correlation between the two tests with respect to overall position within the range of values reported, but absolute values differed significantly. In healthy controls, median C5 level was 205 microg /ml, while for PNH patients receiving eculizumab, 403 microg /ml [&lt;ulink linkID="1989012" linkType="Reference"&gt;1989012&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By October 2013, eculizumab was presumed to be in trials for PNH in Turkey, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Russia [&lt;ulink linkID="1493453" linkType="Reference"&gt;1493453&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2012, data  were presented from a clinical trial of data pooled from a pilot study, TRIUMPH, SHEPHERD and subsequent extension studiespresented at the 54th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA. Patients (n = 195) received iv eculizumab (600 mg q7d for 4 weeks followed by 900 mg for 7 days and 900 mg for every 14 days). Long-term treatment with eculizumab was well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1346656" linkType="Reference"&gt;1346656&lt;/ulink&gt;].	 &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Dry age-related macular degeneration&lt;/subtitle&gt;In July 2009, Alexion began a  placebo-controlled phase II exploratory trial (COMPLETE; 20090055; &lt;ulink linkID="58638" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00935883&lt;/ulink&gt;) to evaluate eculizumab's effects on drusen build-up and geographic atrophy in patients (expected n = 60) with dry AMD. In the induction phase, patients would receive iv eculizumab 600 mg via infusion once weekly for 4 weeks; in the  maintenance phase patients would receive doses of 900 mg eculizumab  every 2 weeks. The primary endpoints were growth in geographic atrophy/change in drusen volume at  6 and 12 months; secondary endpoints were change in visual acuity at 6 and 12 months. The study was due to be completed in July 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1168511" linkType="Reference"&gt;1168511&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2011, preliminary data were expected in early 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1211984" linkType="Reference"&gt;1211984&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2012, clinical data were presented from the prospective, double-masked study (n = 30) at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Annual Meeting, Fort Lauderdale, FL.  At 26 weeks, in eculizumab and placebo groups, the mean drusen cube root values were 0.51 and 0.42 mm, respectively when compared with 0.49 and 0.47 mm, respectively at baseline. At 6 months, the drusen volume was not reduced. Eculizumab was well tolerated until 6 months [&lt;ulink linkID="1284279" linkType="Reference"&gt;1284279&lt;/ulink&gt;].  Later that month, further data were reported at the same conference. At week 26 follow-up, the mean geographic atrophy enlargement rates were 0.19 and 0.18 mm2 in eculizumab and placebo groups, respectively, from baseline values of 2.55 and 2.02 mm2, in the respective groups. The growth rate of geographic atrophy was not significantly decreased [&lt;ulink linkID="1284278" linkType="Reference"&gt;1284278&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2013, the study was complete [&lt;ulink linkID="1168511" linkType="Reference"&gt;1168511&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however since that time, no further development has been reported for that indication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In January 2002, Alexion initiated a phase IIb trial of eculizumab in RA. The trial was expected to enroll approximately 300 patients with mild-to-moderate disease undergoing treatment with moderate doses of methotrexate or &lt;ulink linkID="3488" linkType="Drug"&gt;leflunomide&lt;/ulink&gt;. Patients were to be evaluated after a 6-month drug phase for safety and efficacy, and the primary efficacy endpoint was to be the ACR20 score [&lt;ulink linkID="437814" linkType="Reference"&gt;437814&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2002, Alexion had substantially completed enrollment in the 6-month eculizumab treatment phase IIb study in over 300 RA patients [&lt;ulink linkID="473178" linkType="Reference"&gt;473178&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By January 2003, approximately 350 patients were registered at 69 centers in the US and Canada, completing enrollment [&lt;ulink linkID="477628" linkType="Reference"&gt;477628&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2004, Alexion reported that monthly administration of eculizumab was associated with a moderate improvement in the ACR20 score versus placebo.There was also evidence of a long-term anti-inflammatory effect, with a significant reduction in erythrocyte sedimentation rate. However, biweekly administration of eculizumab was not associated with a significant improvement in ACR20 score. Eculizumab treatment was safe and well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being upper respiratory tract infection, headache and nausea. The most common serious adverse events were myocardial infarction, accidental injury and cerebral infarction. Serious and common adverse event rates were similar between placebo and eculizumab [&lt;ulink linkID="520337" linkType="Reference"&gt;520337&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2001, Alexion was planning to begin a pivotal trial and a supportive trial for RA; each was to include 200 to 300 participants, with the first study expected to begin later in the year [&lt;ulink linkID="426537" linkType="Reference"&gt;426537&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By January 2001, eculizumab had completed a phase II efficacy trial for the treatment of RA and results were undergoing preliminary analysis [&lt;ulink linkID="396672" linkType="Reference"&gt;396672&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A total of 209 patients were treated with placebo or eculizumab in three different treatment arms. Eculizumab appeared to be safe and well tolerated and one of the treatment arms met the primary endpoint of improvement in ACR20 score. Further data from this trial were to be released following unblinding and, after discussions with the FDA, a phase III efficacy trial in RA was to be initiated at the earliest possible opportunity [&lt;ulink linkID="397163" linkType="Reference"&gt;397163&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These data were also presented at the 65th annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology,  in San Francisco, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="429348" linkType="Reference"&gt;429348&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="437814" linkType="Reference"&gt;437814&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2005, phase II trials in RA were ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="603422" linkType="Reference"&gt;603422&lt;/ulink&gt;];  however no further development on this indication has been presented since that time.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 1999 a multicenter, phase II trial was initiated in approximately 200 RA patients in the US [&lt;ulink linkID="335241" linkType="Reference"&gt;335241&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patient enrollment was completed in August 2000. Alexion also commenced dosing in a follow-on open label extension study of eculizumab in these patients, designed to examine long-term safety and tolerability [&lt;ulink linkID="380247" linkType="Reference"&gt;380247&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By July 1998, a phase I/II trial in 40 patients with mild-to-moderate RA had commenced [&lt;ulink linkID="305950" linkType="Reference"&gt;305950&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="291142" linkType="Reference"&gt;291142&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Preliminary results from this trial showed that eculizumab was well tolerated, potent and significantly reduced disease activity when patients received a single dose, ranging from 0.1 to 8.0 mg/kg [&lt;ulink linkID="322159" linkType="Reference"&gt;322159&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Eculizumab was also associated with up to a 30% reduction in C-reactive protein levels [&lt;ulink linkID="335241" linkType="Reference"&gt;335241&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="347452" linkType="Reference"&gt;347452&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2009, eculizumab was in phase II trials for  type 2 membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis  [&lt;ulink linkID="989350" linkType="Reference"&gt;989350&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however since that time, no further development has been reported for that indication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In August 2010, a non-randomized, open-label, single-group, phase I study (&lt;ulink linkID="71391" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01221181&lt;/ulink&gt;; AAAF2403) began in the US to assess the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and C3 nephropathy (n = 6). The primary endpoint was complete remission, defined as proteinuria to &amp;lt; 500 mg/day with normal renal function. The study was expected to complete in December 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1310776" linkType="Reference"&gt;1310776&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2013, enrollment was completed; at that time, Alexion marked this study as a phase II trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1391320" linkType="Reference"&gt;1391320&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Nephritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2005, phase II trials in membranous nephritis were ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="603422" linkType="Reference"&gt;603422&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however no further development on this indication has been presented since that time.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2002, data from two phase II trials were presented at the 35th Annual Meeting and Scientific Exposition of the American Society of Nephrology. Results from C99-004, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in which 117 patients were treated at 23 medical centers with placebo, eculizumab 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, or eculizumab 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks, indicated that eculizumab was well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and headache. The primary efficacy endpoint, 24 h urinary protein, was not significantly different between study groups. However, subset analyzes showed that patients who appeared to benefit most clinically also had more complete complement inhibition. In E99-004, 72 placebo and eculizumab patients from trial C99-004 were given eculizumab 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 12 months. At this time, the trial was ongoing and it was stressed that available patient data may not be indicative of subsequent results. Eculizumab appeared to be generally well tolerated with the most common adverse events being upper respiratory infections, nasal congestion/rhinitis and headache. After 9 months, eculizumab administration was associated with significant improvements in proteinurea, urinary protein/creatinine ratio and serum albumin. At the end of 12 months of therapy, urinary protein decreased 42% from 5.9 +/- 0.7 g/day to 3.4 +/- 0.7 g/day, urinary protein/creatinine ratio decreased 45% from 4.0 +/- 0.5 to 2.2 +/- 0.5 g/mg/day, serum cholesterol decreased 10% from 232 +/- 10 to 208 +/- 7 mg/dl, serum triglycerides decreased 16% from 169 +/- 12 to 142 +/- 12 mg/dl, and serum albumin increased 14% from 2.9 +/- 0.1 to 3.3 +/- 0.1 mg/dl in the 39 patients for whom 1 year of follow-up data was available. For the 55 evaluable E99-004 patients who were treated with eculizumab for 6 months or longer, eculizumab treatment was associated with a 27% 12 month remission rate by Kaplan-Meier analysis [&lt;ulink linkID="469055" linkType="Reference"&gt;469055&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase II trial for lupus nephritis commenced in June 2001. This trial was in addition to the ongoing phase II study with eculizumab in non-lupus patients suffering from membranous nephritis. The trial was expected to enroll approximately 40 lupus nephritis patients at four clinical sites in the US, in order to test the safety and biological efficacy of chronic administration of eculizumab for up to 6 months [&lt;ulink linkID="412090" linkType="Reference"&gt;412090&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This trial was still ongoing in December 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="473178" linkType="Reference"&gt;473178&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2003, Alexion expected to be able to submit efficacy data later in the year [&lt;ulink linkID="476379" linkType="Reference"&gt;476379&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 1999, Alexion initiated a phase II trial of eculizumab involving patients with membranous nephritis [&lt;ulink linkID="335995" linkType="Reference"&gt;335995&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2000, the FDA granted eculizumab Fast Track status for this indication [&lt;ulink linkID="357681" linkType="Reference"&gt;357681&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This trial was ongoing in January 2001 [&lt;ulink linkID="396672" linkType="Reference"&gt;396672&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2002, Alexion completed enrollment in this multicenter study (C99-004) examining the safety and clinical efficacy of repeated dosing of eculizumab during a 4-month treatment period. Approximately 115 membranous nephritis patients were enrolled in the US, and the company had started dosing in a follow-on open label extension study (E99-004) of eculizumab in these patients, designed to examine long-term safety and tolerability [&lt;ulink linkID="440583" linkType="Reference"&gt;440583&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2004, phase II trials in membranous nephritis were ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="574257" linkType="Reference"&gt;574257&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however no further development on this indication has been presented since that time.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Dermatomyositis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In October 2002,  data were presented at the 66th ACR meeting in New Orleans, LA. In a 2-month study, treatment arms included placebo (three participants) or eculizumab (8 mg/kg) every week for 5 weeks, then every 2 weeks (ten participants). At week 9, numbers of adverse events were not significantly different between groups, and investigators reported no serious adverse events in either group. The eculizumab group had moderate improvements in skin score (37%), physician global score (9%) and manual muscle test (MMT) (6%), compared with baseline. The placebo group worsened in physician global score (23%), but improved in skin score (25%) and, to a large degree, in MMT (26%), compared with baseline. Concomitant improvements were observed in several parameters on skin biopsy and in disease intensity, as measured by MRI in the eculizumab group, relative to placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="470328" linkType="Reference"&gt;470328&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however no further development on this indication has been presented since that time.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2001, Alexion released results from a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in 13 patients with persistent dermatomyositis undergoing concomitant treatment with moderate doses of methotrexate or steroids. Overall, eculizumab appeared to be safe and well tolerated in the study population and treatment improved subjective and objective measures of skin rash during the 2-month trial (50% or more improvement in the majority of patients who completed the trial). At this time, Alexion intended to review the clinical data with the FDA in order to finalize its clinical plan for eculizumab in this disease [&lt;ulink linkID="434351" linkType="Reference"&gt;434351&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Early stage clinical trials for dermatomyositis were ongoing in April 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="446377" linkType="Reference"&gt;446377&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however no further development on this indication has been presented since that time.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2000, Alexion filed an IND application with the FDA to commence a phase Ib pilot trial with eculizumab involving patients with dermatomyositis [&lt;ulink linkID="354030" linkType="Reference"&gt;354030&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The trial was designed to investigate the safety profile and clinical effects of eculizumab, and was ongoing in January 2001 [&lt;ulink linkID="396672" linkType="Reference"&gt;396672&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Although eculizumab did not influence the clinical outcome as measured by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, favorable trends in disease activity were observed. At this time, Alexion was considering further clinical development of eculizumab in patient populations with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis [&lt;ulink linkID="412091" linkType="Reference"&gt;412091&lt;/ulink&gt;].

SLE was last listed as a potential indication for eculizumab in October 1999 [&lt;ulink linkID="344739" linkType="Reference"&gt;344739&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, the company later went on to initiate clinical trials for the more specific indication of lupus nephritis [&lt;ulink linkID="344739" linkType="Reference"&gt;344739&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Alexion has published studies of the effects of eculizumab treatment in NZB/W F1 mice, a murine model of SLE. Treatment with eculizumab was associated with a delay in onset of severe proteinurea and prolonged survival.Approximately 80% of the eculizumab-treated mice were alive at week 40 compared to none of the untreated mice [&lt;ulink linkID="541944" linkType="Reference"&gt;541944&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Kidney transplant rejection and delayed graft function&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2015, the company was developing plans for further trials in AMR patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1641364" linkType="Reference"&gt;1641364&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in February 2017, phase II development in AMR in presensitized renal transplant from deceased donor was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1901218" linkType="Reference"&gt;1901218&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2014, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II/III trial (&lt;ulink linkID="189608" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02145182&lt;/ulink&gt;; ECU-DGF-201; 2013-004650-25; PROTECT) began in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia and Brazil in patients (expected n = 286) at increased risk of delayed graft function after kidney transplantation. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delayed graft function in the first 7 days following transplantation. At that time, the trial was expected to complete in December 2016. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either eculizumab or placebo: either as one dose of eculizumab 1200 mg or placebo just prior to the time of reperfusion of the kidney allograft and one dose of eculizumab 900 mg or placebo within 18 to 24 h of the first dose. Randomization was stratified according to whether the donor kidney was preserved by cold storage or by machine perfusion, as well as by donor type [&lt;ulink linkID="1587729" linkType="Reference"&gt;1587729&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1653744" linkType="Reference"&gt;1653744&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2015, enrollment in the registration trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1720368" linkType="Reference"&gt;1720368&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2016, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1587729" linkType="Reference"&gt;1587729&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Data were reported in December 2016. The primary endpoint of incidence of DGF with a two-dose regimen of eculizumab compared with placebo did not reach statistical significance;  the incidence of DGF, death, graft loss, or loss to follow-up at 7 days post-transplant was 35.9% for patients receiving eculizumab compared with 41.7% for placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1887759" linkType="Reference"&gt;1887759&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2011, an investigator-led, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study (&lt;ulink linkID="79547" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01403389&lt;/ulink&gt;; HSM 10-1600) was initiated in the US by &lt;ulink linkID="20631" linkType="Company"&gt;Mount Sinai School of Medicine&lt;/ulink&gt;, in collaboration with Alexion, to assess the safety and efficacy of eculizumab for the prevention of delayed graft function (by preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury) in high-risk patients (estimated n = 20) following deceased donor kidney transplantation.

In April 2014, enrollment was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1550150" linkType="Reference"&gt;1550150&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2015, data were expected from the trial in 2015 [&lt;ulink linkID="1639634" linkType="Reference"&gt;1639634&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, combined data from this and a second similar trial were presented at the 2018 American Transplant Congress in Washington DC. Kidney transplant recipients (n = 27) were randomized to receive eculizumab (1200 mg) or control infusion, plus standard dose tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, with an additional dose of eculizumab (900 mg) administered 12 to 24 h later in the second study. While eculizumab was well tolerated, with similar levels of serious adverse events reported in the two groups, the primary endpoint of prevention of delayed graft function was not met with a rate of 44 and 45% in the ecuizumab and control groups, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2054650" linkType="Reference"&gt;2054650&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By February 2012, enrollment  had commenced in a company-sponsored, multinational deceased-donor kidney transplant trial in presensitized patients at elevated risk of acute humoral rejection [&lt;ulink linkID="1391320" linkType="Reference"&gt;1391320&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In March 2013, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1456726" linkType="Reference"&gt;1456726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2013, the deceased-donor kidney tranplant trial re-opened to recruit additional patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1641364" linkType="Reference"&gt;1641364&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2013, 9-week preliminary data were presented at the European Society for Organ Transplantation (ESOT) in Vienna, Austria, from the single-arm, phase II trial for the prevention of acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in 47 sensitized deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients. The primary endpoint of 9-week post-transplantation treatment failure was seen in 10.6% of patients; 6.4% of patients had acute AMR, compared with an expected 30% AMR rate [&lt;ulink linkID="1475581" linkType="Reference"&gt;1475581&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2015, preliminary one-year data from the ongoing, single-arm, phase II trial were presented at the 2015 American Transplant Congress on Neuropathic Pain  in Philadelphia, PA. The composite endpoint of week 9 post-transplant failure occurred in 10 of 80 patients (12.5%), with a 7.5% rate of AMR. At  one year, the post-transplant treatment failure rate was 15 of 80 patients (18.8%), the incidence of AMR was 10%, and graft and patient survival were 87.1 and 97.4%, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1656997" linkType="Reference"&gt;1656997&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further one-year data were presented at the same conference. Overall, eculizumab effectively reduced the incidence of acute AMR in sensitized deceased donor kidney transplant recipients and was well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1682522" linkType="Reference"&gt;1682522&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In September 2013, enrollment in the living-donor transplant trial was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1475581" linkType="Reference"&gt;1475581&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2015, results from the 102-patient, living-donor kidney transplant trial were reported. The primary endpoint of post-transplantation treatment failure (occurrence of acute antibody mediated rejection, graft loss, patient decease or loss to follow-up) at week 9 was not met, with a 9.8% rate in the eculizumab arm compared with 15.7% in the control arm [&lt;ulink linkID="1624907" linkType="Reference"&gt;1624907&lt;/ulink&gt;].

The primary endpoint was the incidence of acute humoral rejection in the first 28 days after transplant. The study was expected to complete in April 2013  [&lt;ulink linkID="1310781" linkType="Reference"&gt;1310781&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In September 2017, data from an interim analysis were presented at the American Association of Neuromuscular  and Electrodiagnostic Medicine Annual Meeting in Phoenix, AZ. Data showed that the benefits for patients treated with eculizumab in the REGAIN study were sustained in the extension study with an additional 52 weeks of eculizumab treatment. The safety profile was consistent with that in the REGAIN trial. At that time, the study was ongoing and expected to complete in January 2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="1962056" linkType="Reference"&gt;1962056&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2019, the trial was completed. In February 2019, data from 117 patients were published from an interim analysis. Data from the open-label extension study showed that the improvements demonstrated during the initial six-month duration of the REGAIN trial, were sustained over a treatment period of three years. At the time of data analysis more than 55% of patients enrolled in the open-label extension study showed clinically meaningful response, based on the MG-Activities of Daily Living scale (MG-ADL), and the majority of patients (56%) achieved minimal manifestations or pharmacological remission [&lt;ulink linkID="2127705" linkType="Reference"&gt;2127705&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2127965" linkType="Reference"&gt;2127965&lt;/ulink&gt;].

By October 2015, enrollment was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1707752" linkType="Reference"&gt;1707752&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2016, the trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1550291" linkType="Reference"&gt;1550291&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2016, negative topline data from the 125-patient trial were reported.  The primary endpoint of change from baseline in Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living Profile (MG-ADL) total score at week 26 was not met; however, clinically meaningful improvements in MG-ADL and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) measures were observed  in patients treated with eculizumab versus placebo. At that time, further data analyses were ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1769865" linkType="Reference"&gt;1769865&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In April 2017, further data were presented at the 69th AAN Annual Meeting in Boston, MA. At week 26, more patients in eculizumab treatment group achieved clinically meaningful response in MG-ADL and QMG score compared to placebo (40 and 13% of patients in eculizumab and placebo groups, respectively; p &amp;lt; 0.001). In eculizumab and placebo groups, the benefit of eculizumab treatment was apparent within the first 2 weeks;  and dual response was achieved by 19 and 6% of patients, respectively, and the reponse was sustained till week 26 (p &amp;lt;/= 0.05 for all) [&lt;ulink linkID="1920039" linkType="Reference"&gt;1920039&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2017, further data were presented at the 3rd EAN Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Between Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) Fatigue score and MG-ADL total score, Neuro-QOL Fatigue score and QMG total score, and Neuro-QOL Fatigue score and Myasthenia Gravis-QOL15 total score, a close correlation was observed with correlation coefficients of 0.63, 0.57 and 0.75, respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;lt; 0.0001 and &amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkID="1950812" linkType="Reference"&gt;1950812&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In September 2011, data were presented at the annual Scientific Session of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) in San Francisco, CA. The cross-over study enrolled 14 patients with moderate to severe muscle weakness despite immunosuppressant treatment. In the first treatment period, the primary endpoint of a three-point reduction in  QMG score after 16 weeks was achieved by 86 and 57% of eculizumab and placebo recipients, respectively; the difference between the two groups was not significant. However, a significant improvement in the lead secondary endpoint of overall reduction in mean QMG total score from baseline to last visit was observed in eculizumab-treated patients.

In the first subgroup analysis assessing eculizumab in aHUS adult patients, with or without a history of kidney transplant, eculizumab achieved clinically meaningful improvements in hematologic markers of complement-mediated TMA and reversal of renal damage in both non-transplant patients and those with a history of kidney transplant. At 26 weeks, the mean change in platelet count from baseline was 132.6 x 109/l and 146.2 x 109/l for non-transplant and transplant patients, respectively. The mean change from baseline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 31.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 19.0 m/min/1.73 m2 in non-transplant and transplant patients, respectively. In the second subgroup analysis assessing eculizumab in aHUS adult patients, with or without dialysis at baseline, eculizumab achieved clinically meaningful improvements in hematologic markers of complement-mediated TMA and reversal of renal damage in both non-transplant patients and those with a history of kidney transplant. Eculizumab significantly improved platelet count in patients with and without dialysis; the mean change in platelet count from baseline was 163.2 x 109/l and 87.4 x 109/l for patients with and without dialysis, respectively. The mena eGFR was 35.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 20.0 m/min/1.73 m2 for the non-dialysis and dialysis groups, respectively. In the third subgroup analysis, assessing eculizumab in aHUS pediatric patients, with or without dialysis, eculizumab achieved clinically meaningful improvements in hematologic markers of complement-mediated TMA and reversed renal damage in both the dialysis and non-dialysis groups. The mean change in platelet count from baseline was 149.8 x 109/l and 180.2 x 109/l for the dialysis and non-dialysis groups, respectively.

Further clinical data from a retrospective subanalysis of this trial were presented at the same conference. Data demonstrated that complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy was inhibited and clinically meaningful improvements in platelet count and renal function were produced by eculizumab treatment after one year in patients with or without a history of renal transplant [&lt;ulink linkID="1682519" linkType="Reference"&gt;1682519&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2013, three-year data from a prospective, open-label, single-arm, phase II trial of eculizumab in adult and adolescent patients with a long  duration of aHUS and chronic kidney disease who had prior  plasma exchange or infusion therapy were presented at Kidney Week 2013, the annual meeting of the American Society of Nephrology in Atlanta, GA. The co-primary endpoints were the  TMA event-free status and hematologic normalization at a median of 156 weeks. Long-term treatment with eculizumab was associated with improvements in hematologic and renal function during a 3-year treatment period. Eculizumab achieved TMA event-free status and hematologic normalization in 95 and 90% of patients, respectively, at 3 years. Additionally, eculizumab improved the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate by week 4, and maintained long-term improvement in the quality of life based on the EuroQoL5D (EQ-5D)  scale at 3 years [&lt;ulink linkID="1498140" linkType="Reference"&gt;1498140&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2013, three-year data from a prospective, open-label, single-arm, phase II trial of eculizumab in adults and adolescent patients with actively progressing TMA (n = 17) were presented at Kidney Week 2013, the annual meeting of the American Society of Nephrology in Atlanta, GA. In the long-term extension phase, eculizumab inhibited complement-mediated TMA based on rapid and sustained improvement in platelet count at 3 years. Hematologic normalization and TMA event-free status was achieved with eculizumab treatment. Additionally, long-term eculizumab therapy achieved a sustained improvement in the mean change of estimated glomerular filtration at 3 years (38 ml/min/1.73m) [&lt;ulink linkID="1498140" linkType="Reference"&gt;1498140&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By October 2013, eculizumab was presumed to be in trials for aHUS in Turkey [&lt;ulink linkID="1493453" linkType="Reference"&gt;1493453&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2013, data were reported from  a retrospective study and  an ongoing prospective study in pediatric and adult Japanese aHUS patients.

Patients (n = 20) received eculizumab infusion (900 mg/week for 4 weeks, 1200 mg in week 5 and 1200 mg q2w) for 26 weeks.  The TMA event-free status was maintained by 18 of 19 patients for two years and the remaining one patient maintained for 22 months. The percentage of patients achieving TMA event-free status at two years was 95%. The percentage of patients achieving hematological normalization was 90% at  two years. At two years, the percentage of increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline was 42%.

Patients (n = 17) received eculizumab (900 mg/week for 4 weeks, 1200 mg in week 5 and 1200 mg for q3w). Regardless of the mutation status, eculizumab rapidly inhibited and sustained the terminal complement activity.  The percentage of patients with mutation who achieved TMA event-free status was 92, 100 and 70% in 002, 003 and retrospective studies, respectively, and the percentage of patients without mutation in the respective studies were 75, 86 and 71%.

In June 2011, final data from these patients were presented at the 16th Congress of the EHA in London, UK. Event-free TMA was achieved in 80% of patients. Key secondary endpoints were also achieved. Platelet count normalization was achieved in 90% of patients; all patients who had normal platelet count at baseline (85%) maintained that level after discontinuation of plasma exchange/infusion and commencement of eculizumab treatment. TMA intervention rate fell from a median of 0.23 events/patient/day to 0, and 35% of patients experienced a sustained improvement of at least one stage of CKD.

Patients receiving eculizumab demonstrated improvement from baseline to week 26 in platelet count of 73 × 10(9)/l. Hematologic normalization and TMA event-free status was achieved in 76 and 88% of eculizumab-treated patients, respectively. Eculizumab-treated patients also experienced significant increases in renal function evaluated by eGFR, and 4 out of 5 patients requiring dialysis at treatment initiation discontinued dialysis during treatment. Improvements in health-related quality of life were also reported by the eculizumab-treated patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1244045" linkType="Reference"&gt;1244045&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In November 2012,  2-year follow-up data from an extension study of the two trials were presented at the American Society of Nephrology annual meeting in San Diego, CA.

These events include the opsonization of particles for phagocytosis, leukocyte activation and assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435653"&gt;435653&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445228"&gt;445228&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435653"&gt;435653&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435654"&gt;435654&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435718"&gt;435718&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The system is responsible for killing and removing from the circulation organisms, cells and cell components which are recognized as foreign. In addition to host defense against bacterial agents, complement is involved in the disposal of immune complexes and the products of inflammatory injury, and serves as an interface between innate and adaptive immunity [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435653"&gt;435653&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Several complement proteins are cleaved during activation of the complement system and three pathways of activation have been described; the classical, the alternative and the lectin pathway [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435653"&gt;435653&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The pathways leading to the cleavage of C3 are triggered enzyme cascades. Downstream in these pathways, C3 is cleaved into C3a and C3b. C3a is released while C3b forms C5 convertases, which in turn cleave C5 to C5a and C5b. Following complement activation, pro-inflammatory peptides like the anaphylotoxins C3a and C5a are generated and C5b-9 (MAC) is formed. Assembly of the MAC from the terminal components (C5 to C9) of the cascade leads to membrane damage. In addition, complement activation products, especially the anaphylotoxins, elicit a number of biological effects including chemotaxis of leukocytes, degranulation of phagocytic cells, mast cells and basophils, smooth muscle contraction and the increase of vascular permeability [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435653"&gt;435653&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445228"&gt;445228&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445736"&gt;445736&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Under normal circumstances, the regulatory mechanisms of complement are balanced, so that the activation of complement occurs on the surface of invading microorganisms and the deposition of complement on normal cells and tissues is usually limited [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435653"&gt;435653&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445228"&gt;445228&lt;/ulink&gt;]. If the mechanisms that regulate this balance are abnormal, the complement system might then cause tissue injury [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435656"&gt;435656&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Excessive or inappropriate activation of the complement system can lead to harmful and life-threatening consequences secondary to severe inflammatory tissue destruction. These consequences can manifest clinically in a variety of ways, including multiple organ failure, hyperacute graft rejection and septic shock [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435656"&gt;435656&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Inappropriate complement activation and its deposition on host cells can also lead to direct complement-mediated cell lysis of target structures, or indirectly to tissue destruction due to the generation of powerful mediators of inflammation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435653"&gt;435653&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445228"&gt;445228&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Complement plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445236"&gt;445236&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435694"&gt;435694&lt;/ulink&gt;] and dermatomyositis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445242"&gt;445242&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It is also responsible for disease states associated with bio-incompatibility, including transplant rejection [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445249"&gt;445249&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition, complement activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac and intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445251"&gt;445251&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Other conditions in which complement activation has been proposed to play a role include stroke [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445254"&gt;445254&lt;/ulink&gt;], multiple sclerosis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445384"&gt;445384&lt;/ulink&gt;], pancreatitis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445255"&gt;445255&lt;/ulink&gt;], psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445272"&gt;445272&lt;/ulink&gt;], Alzheimer's disease [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445278"&gt;445278&lt;/ulink&gt;] and prion-induced diseases [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445286"&gt;445286&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Therapeutic inhibition of complement is, therefore, potentially important in protecting against the development of certain diseases and it has been shown to be useful in animal models of sepsis, intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury, myocardial reperfusion injury, nephritis, arthritis and graft rejection.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Several complement inhibitors are currently under investigation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="212463"&gt;212463&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="225318"&gt;225318&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="281110"&gt;281110&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435656"&gt;435656&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435722"&gt;435722&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435723"&gt;435723&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435725"&gt;435725&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="436916"&gt;436916&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;Eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (5G1.1), under development by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="13979"&gt;Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;, is a humanized C5 inhibitory monoclonal antibody (mAb) that prevents the cleavage of human complement component C5 into its pro-inflammatory components and targets the complement components C5a and C5b-9 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445382"&gt;445382&lt;/ulink&gt;]. As mentioned, the early steps of the complement cascade play an important role in the removal of infectious agents and several normal functions of the immune system. The rationale of specifically blocking C5 is that the normal upstream disease-preventing functions of complement remain intact, while the production of the abnormal downstream disease-causing actions of complement are blocked. This antibody, therefore, potentially avoids the disruption of antibacterial-protective mechanisms, which are believed to be mediated primarily through C3b [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="438165"&gt;438165&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;Eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; is undergoing phase II clinical trials for a variety of chronic inflammatory conditions, and is being developed as a potential treatment for RA, SLE and nephritis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="190673"&gt;190673&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="292328"&gt;292328&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="412090"&gt;412090&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The drug is currently in phase II trials for nephritis and has completed phase I/II trials in SLE and phase II trials in RA [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="335241"&gt;335241&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="328001"&gt;328001&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="335995"&gt;335995&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="396672"&gt;396672&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;Eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; is also currently undergoing phase I trials for psoriasis and pemphigus [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="384948"&gt;384948&lt;/ulink&gt;], and has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA for the treatment of dermatomyositis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="385057"&gt;385057&lt;/ulink&gt;], and membranous nephritis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="440583"&gt;440583&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Alexion has also developed a short-acting C5 complement inhibitor that is a humanized single chain mAb fragment. This compound is known as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11065"&gt;pexelizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (formerly 5G1.1-SC) and it is being tested for the treatment of acute cardiovascular diseases associated with complement activation, including acute myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina and revascularization/reperfusion therapies. This drug was designed to have the advantage of enhanced tissue penetration, desirable for effective treatment of these acute life-threatening conditions [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="188760"&gt;188760&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11065"&gt;Pexelizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; are currently in at least eight clinical development programs [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435963"&gt;435963&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A phase III clinical study with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11065"&gt;pexelizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in cardiopulmonary bypass patients has been initiated. In addition, two large phase II studies with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11065"&gt;pexelizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in acute MI patients are under way. Since &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11065"&gt;pexelizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; has recently been evaluated, this review will focus primarily on &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Humanized 5G1.1, Fab and scFv molecules were produced by grafting the complementary determining regions of 5G1.1 on to human framework regions [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258884"&gt;258884&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Competitive ELISA analysis indicated that no framework changes were required in the humanized variable regions for retention of high affinity binding to C5, even at framework positions predicted by computer modeling to influence CDR canonical structure. The humanized Fab and scFv molecules blocked complement-mediated lysis of chicken erythrocytes and porcine aortic endothelial cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Complete complement inhibition occurred at 3-fold molar excess, relative to the human C5 concentration. Humanized 5G1.1 scFv also effectively blocked C5a generation. In addition, intact humanized 5G1.1 antibody blocked human complement lytic activity at concentrations identical to the original murine monoclonal antibody, indicating that humanized 5G1.1 and its derivatives retained both the affinity and blocking functions of murine 5G1.1 antibody [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258884"&gt;258884&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258883"&gt;258883&lt;/ulink&gt;]. 5G1.1 is supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic solution (2 mg/ml) for iv injection [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="212467"&gt;212467&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="258884"&gt;258884&lt;/ulink&gt;] and it has picomolar affinity for a sequence within human C5. 5G1.1 can be administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously, allowing patient administration [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="438165"&gt;438165&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Heart disease&lt;/subtitle&gt;There is growing body of evidence pointing to a substantial disease-promoting role of complement components in MI and unstable angina [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445289"&gt;445289&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Activation of the complement cascade in MI patients is evidenced by elevated levels of activated complement byproducts in the blood of patients during acute MI and by the deposition of activated complement components in damaged heart tissue [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445382"&gt;445382&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Interestingly, terminal complement components play a key role in the apoptotic process in heart tissue during MI [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="241313"&gt;241313&lt;/ulink&gt;], and blockade of the complement cascade at C5 has been shown to substantially reduce myocardial apoptosis and tissue damage in rats [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="241313"&gt;241313&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Complement activation was also found in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445311"&gt;445311&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This finding was associated with increased patient morbidity, including MI, stroke, cognitive dysfunction and blood loss [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445311"&gt;445311&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Studies in primates demonstrated that inhibition of complement activation reduces heart damage associated with coronary ischemia and reperfusion in preclinical models. Furthermore, treatment of hypoxic/reoxygenated HUVECs with h5G1.1 scFv attenuated C5b-9 deposition, NF-kappaB translocation and VCAM-1 expression [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="353137"&gt;353137&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Intestinal and lung ischemia-reperfusion&lt;/subtitle&gt;A recent study reported that anti-C5a therapy significantly improved intestinal ischemia-reperfusion tissue injury as well as lung injury in rats [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445313"&gt;445313&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These results suggested that C5 inhibition could also limit the complaints in the broader general surgery population as well as in patients with ulcerative colitis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="357827"&gt;357827&lt;/ulink&gt;] Interestingly, C5 inhibition was associated with significant reduction in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha levels [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="357827"&gt;357827&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Inflammatory arthritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;Animals deficient in the complement component C5 are not susceptible to the onset of active arthritis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="363495"&gt;363495&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the absence of C5 cleavage, the presence of TNFalpha is not sufficient to promote arthritis. A recent study reported that administration of anti-C5 mAb ameliorates established collagen-induced arthritis in mice and rats [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="190673"&gt;190673&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="212456"&gt;212456&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Systemic administration of the anti-C5 mAb effectively inhibited terminal complement activation in vivo and prevented the onset of arthritis in immunized animals. In addition, anti-C5 mAb treatment was also highly effective in ameliorating established disease. These results suggested a critical role for activated terminal complement components, not only in the induction, but also in the progression of collagen-induced arthritis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="190673"&gt;190673&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="212456"&gt;212456&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Renal disease and lupus&lt;/subtitle&gt;A C5 inhibitor was administered in both an acute and rapid progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) model that normally leads to crescentic changes, the most common histological lesion observed in lupus nephritis. The inhibitor was also administered to the NZB/NZW F1 lupus-prone mouse model. C5 inhibition prevented histological and clinical development of nephritis in the RPGN model and C5 inhibitor administration in the lupus-prone mouse model reduced histologic and biochemical evidence of kidney disease. Survival at 10 months was markedly improved from 5% in placebo-treated lupus-prone mice to 85% in C5 inhibitor-treated lupus-prone mice [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="190673"&gt;190673&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="232606"&gt;232606&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="280073"&gt;280073&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Hematological diseases&lt;/subtitle&gt;C5 inhibition has also been shown to prevent platelet loss in a model of ITP [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="392090"&gt;392090&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;5G1.1 blocks complement activity for 1 to 2 weeks after a single dose [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="438165"&gt;438165&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;No toxicity has been reported in humans [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="228105"&gt;228105&lt;/ulink&gt;] or rhesus monkeys [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="212462"&gt;212462&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Interestingly, a recent study reported that C5 plays an important role in liver regeneration, strongly implicating the complement system as a crucial regulatory component of hepatic homeostasis. C5-deficient mice show severely defective liver regeneration and persistent parenchymal necrosis after exposure to carbon tetrachloride. In addition, these mice show marked delays in the re-entry of hepatocytes into the cell cycle (S phase) and diminished mitotic activity. Reconstitution of C5-deficient mice with murine C5 or C5a significantly restores hepatocyte regeneration after toxic injury. Furthermore, blockade of the C5a receptor abrogates the ability of hepatocytes to proliferate in response to liver injury [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445317"&gt;445317&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The role of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; on hepatic regeneration is unclear at this point.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;C5 is also known to mediate chemotactic and activation events that are the basis for granulomatous responses during murine tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mice with natural deficiency in C5 are unable to develop productive granulomatous responses, and are impaired in limiting organism growth within the lung [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445321"&gt;445321&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;A phase I/II, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating trial tested the role of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in ameliorating RA. The trial was designed to gather clinical data on the safety profile and biological effects of a single administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in RA. The preliminary analysis demonstrated that the drug was well tolerated and was associated with a significant reduction in disease activity in these patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445382"&gt;445382&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The safety and biological activity of the antibody was examined in 40 patients with mild-to-moderate RA, each of whom received a single dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (0.1 to 8 mg/kg). The drug was safe and well tolerated, and showed no detectable immunogenicity in the population studied. Furthermore, a single dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; potently and rapidly blocked complement activity in a dose-dependent fashion for up to 2 weeks [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="353141"&gt;353141&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Complement inhibition after a single dose was associated with a beneficial clinical effect, with the highest dose (8 mg/kg; n = 6) resulting in a significant 30% reduction in C-reactive protein levels, compared to placebo-treated patients in which C-reactive protein increased by 24%. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;Eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was also associated with a trend in reductions in other measurement of disease activity, including tender joint count, swollen joint count, patients' global assessment of disease and patients' global assessment of pain [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="291142"&gt;291142&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="305950"&gt;305950&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="322159"&gt;322159&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="335241"&gt;335241&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="347452"&gt;347452&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="335995"&gt;335995&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Systemic lupus erythematosus&lt;/subtitle&gt;Alexion has completed preliminary analysis of the phase I study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in SLE. The trial was designed to gather data on pharmacodynamics, safety and biological effects of a single administration of the drug in SLE patients. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;Eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was well tolerated and its administration was associated with significant reduction in the incidence of proteinuria. The phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating trial examined the safety and biological activity of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in 24 patients with mild SLE, each of whom received a single dose of the antibody (0.1 to 8 mg/kg). There was no detectable immunogenicity in the patients studied and a single dose of antibody blocked complement activity in patients for up to 2 weeks. Administration of a single dose of 8 mg/kg was associated with significant decrease in proteinuria [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="292328"&gt;292328&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="325861"&gt;325861&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="328001"&gt;328001&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Dermatomyositis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In 2001, Alexion completed a 2-month, phase I, pilot safety trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in 13 dermatomyositis patients with persistent dermatomyositis, undergoing concomitant treatment with moderate doses of methotrexate or steroids. The patients were evaluated in either a placebo (n = 3) or a single drug treatment arm (n = 10). Drug treatment consisted of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (8 mg/kg/week iv) for 5 weeks and then 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 2 months. The patients were evaluated after 2 months of treatment for safety and for trends in clinical improvement. In this placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, the drug was safe and well tolerated and associated with an improvement in skin rash. Exploratory clinical measurements included clinical and laboratory assessments of skin rash and muscle strength. There were consistent trends in improvements with drug administration in subjective and objective measurements of skin rash during the 2-month trial. While there was little baseline skin inflammation in the placebo group, a majority of drug-treated patients who completed the trial experienced an improvement of &gt;/= 50% in their skin rash score [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435888"&gt;435888&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="434351"&gt;434351&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="354030"&gt;354030&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pemphigoid&lt;/subtitle&gt;Published observations have shown that clinical improvement of pemphigoid is associated with reduced levels of complement activation in the previously affected skin, further supporting the rationale for testing the C5 inhibitor in this disease. Phase I trials of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;  in pemphigoid syndrome are ongoing [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="435888"&gt;435888&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="361798"&gt;361798&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426537"&gt;426537&lt;/ulink&gt;], but no data are currently available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Psoriasis&lt;/subtitle&gt;A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the safety profile and clinical effects of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in severe psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="352110"&gt;352110&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2001, Alexion completed a phase I pilot safety trial involving 40 psoriasis patients, which showed that the drug was well tolerated. Drug administration did not influence the clinical outcome as measured by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score, although favorable trends in certain measures of disease activity were observed. Drug administration dose-dependently blocked hemolytic activity in the blood of treated patients and dose-dependently reduced deposition of activated terminal complement in psoriatic plaques [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="412091"&gt;412091&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II &lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In a phase II trial in 209 patients, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; administration appeared to be safe and well tolerated and the adverse event profile was comparable to placebo. Patients were treated with placebo; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (8 mg/kg iv) once per week for 4 weeks and then once every month (induction/monthly group); &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (8 mg/kg iv) once per week for 4 weeks followed by once every 2 weeks (induction/biweekly group); or, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (8 mg/kg iv) once every 2 weeks (biweekly group). The results after 3 months of treatment showed that the induction/monthly group met the primary endpoint of the trial (improvement in ACR20 score after 3 months of treatment), while the induction/biweekly and biweekly groups did not statistically meet the endpoint. The ACR20 response in the induction/monthly group was 44% as compared to 18% ACR20 response in the placebo group, by per protocol analysis. Both induction/monthly and induction/biweekly groups also met the secondary endpoint of changes in C-reactive protein after 3 months of therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429348"&gt;429348&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In patients with elevated C5b-9 levels over 200 ng/ml, the ACR20 at 3 months of treatment were dose-dependent. The ACR20 results obtained in patients with elevated baseline C5b-9 levels were: placebo (9%); biweekly (33%); induction/monthly (57%); and induction/biweekly (50%). Further data from this trial are to be released following unblinding [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="397163"&gt;397163&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429348"&gt;429348&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Alexion has also started a phase IIb trial in RA patients. The trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; and to confirm the most efficacious dose regimen. The trial will consist of approximately 300 patients with mild-to-moderate disease who are being treated concomitantly with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3488"&gt;leflunomide&lt;/ulink&gt;. The trial will consist of three treatment arms; patients will be treated with placebo; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (8 mg/kg/week iv) for 4 weeks and then once every month; or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (8 mg/kg/week) for 4 weeks and then bimonthly. The patients will be evaluated after a 6-month drug phase for safety and efficacy, and the primary efficacy endpoint will be the ACR20 score [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="437814"&gt;437814&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Systemic lupus erythematosus and nephritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In August 1999, Alexion initiated a phase II study with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in lupus patients suffering from membranous nephritis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="335995"&gt;335995&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 40 lupus nephritis patients at four clinical sites in the US and has been designed to test the safety and biological efficacy of chronic administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; for up to 6 months [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="412090"&gt;412090&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2001, Alexion expected phase II results to be available in mid-2002 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="426537"&gt;426537&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;In clinical trials to date, the drug was well tolerated and showed no detectable immunogenicity in the patients studied. No major adverse reactions have been reported. In the dermatomyositis trial, the most common side effects were headache and rash, and it appeared that these side effects were comparable to the placebo group. In the psoriasis trial, the most common side effects were headaches and unspecified pain. The most common side effects in the RA trial were comparable to placebo and included diarrhea and headaches [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429348"&gt;429348&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="434351"&gt;434351&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;C5 inhibitors appear to intervene at a point that allows preservation of the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial responses at the C3 level, while conceivably inhibiting the downstream disease-causing actions. Selective suppression of this immune response could certainly provide a significant therapeutic advantage compared to existing therapies. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;Eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; blocks the production of harmful complement components and appears to be promising for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, including RA, SLE and a variety of conditions with skin involvement, including dermatomyositis, pemphigoid and psoriasis. There are other conditions in which C5a seems to play an important role, including asthma and HIV infection, and these conditions might potentially become therapeutic targets in which C5a inhibition could be useful [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445327"&gt;445327&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445336"&gt;445336&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Since complement activation has both positive and negative effects, the risk associated with complement inhibition is probably not negligible and long-term studies will be necessary to assess possible risks. In particular, a theoretical concern is the role that C5 plays in hepatic regeneration and in combating granulomatous infections such as tuberculosis. Long-term studies will determine whether C5 inhibition could have deleterious effects in these processes.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;So far, limited animal and human studies have shown that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; inhibits complement in a dose-dependent manner, is well tolerated and has no significant side effects. The results have been encouraging so far but more clinical trials are needed. There are still concerns that this drug does not block activation of the early stages of the complement system. This inhibitor allows the generation of C3a. Whilst C3a is considered a less potent inflammatory molecule than C5a, the C3a receptor tissue expression appears to be much broader than originally expected [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445349"&gt;445349&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445352"&gt;445352&lt;/ulink&gt;], and recent studies have shown that C3a can induce the production of inflammatory cytokines in a fashion similar to C5a [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445354"&gt;445354&lt;/ulink&gt;]. C3a could, in theory, play a significant role in inflammatory conditions and acute-phase response even after C5 inhibition. Nevertheless, if clinical trials prove successful, this drug as well as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11065"&gt;pexelizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; could have a broad range of applications where complement-mediated inflammation contributes to disease pathology. There are currently no biological therapies on the market with the actions and specificity of these drugs and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="15593"&gt;eculizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; could have a very strong therapeutic potential.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="13979">Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc</Company><Country
