In June 2012, the FDA issued a complete response letter and requested for additional information with regard to the safety and effectiveness of the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="1304683" linkType="Reference"&gt;1304683&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2013, the NDA was resubmitted and the company expected a notification by the FDA regarding the PDUFA date and also regarding the Advisory Committee meeting [&lt;ulink linkID="1387434" linkType="Reference"&gt;1387434&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in March 2013, the FDA had accepted the resubmitted NDA [&lt;ulink linkID="1392052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1392052&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in May 2013, the FDA had set July 17, 2013 for the Advisory Committee meeting review [&lt;ulink linkID="1423296" linkType="Reference"&gt;1423296&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, in June 2013, the company reported that it would perform further analysis of  data from study 022 and submit a revised NDA to the FDA [&lt;ulink linkID="1444687" linkType="Reference"&gt;1444687&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in August 2013, the FDA issued a complete response letter   and requested to evaluate respiratory safety data  from study 022 [&lt;ulink linkID="1470198" linkType="Reference"&gt;1470198&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2013, the company completed analysis of respiratory safety data from study 022 and resubmitted its NDA. At that time,   approval was expected in the second quarter of 2014 and launch in the second half of 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1503195" linkType="Reference"&gt;1503195&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2013, PDUFA date was set to May 25, 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1508078" linkType="Reference"&gt;1508078&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In April 2014, the FDA's Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products advisory committee had voted against the approval recommendation of MoxDuo IR due to insufficient evidence [&lt;ulink linkID="1549164" linkType="Reference"&gt;1549164&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in May 2014, the FDA issued a complete response letter and requested additional clinical information with regard to the safety and effectiveness of the drug. At that time, the company was planning to request a meeting with the FDA to clarify the steps required for approval [&lt;ulink linkID="1562060" linkType="Reference"&gt;1562060&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2014, the FDA had set the "End of Review" meeting for July 9, 2014 to discuss the NDA application [&lt;ulink linkID="1565235" linkType="Reference"&gt;1565235&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2014, feedback on end-of-review meeting with the FDA was provided on the requirements of approval for the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="1576757" linkType="Reference"&gt;1576757&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in August 2014, the US FDA rejected the NDA for the third time and suggested the company to conduct a repeat phase II trial and one or more phase III trials.  However, the company decided to discontinue the development of all the formulations of  MoxDuo due to the expenditure of the trial within the limited residual patent life [&lt;ulink linkID="1585733" linkType="Reference"&gt;1585733&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2008, QRx was seeking to outlicense the drug for territories outside the US [&lt;ulink linkID="971067" linkType="Reference"&gt;971067&lt;/ulink&gt;]; this was still the case in May 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="1057182" linkType="Reference"&gt;1057182&lt;/ulink&gt;].  However, in November 2010,  QRxPharma's strategy was to copromote its products in the US and seek strategic partnerships for other markets [&lt;ulink linkID="1149680" linkType="Reference"&gt;1149680&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2014, &lt;ulink linkID="20666" linkType="Company"&gt;Uniquest&lt;/ulink&gt; was seeking to outlicense the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="1555622" linkType="Reference"&gt;1555622&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2012, Canadian commercialization partner &lt;ulink linkID="27477" linkType="Company"&gt;Paladin Labs&lt;/ulink&gt; (a subsidiary of &lt;ulink linkID="1089706" linkType="Company"&gt;Endo International&lt;/ulink&gt;) planned to file a New Drug Submission (NDS) to Health Canada in the first half of 2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1329877" linkType="Reference"&gt;1329877&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1530098" linkType="Reference"&gt;1530098&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In August 2009, NDA filings with the FDA were expected in 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1037091" linkType="Reference"&gt;1037091&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in November 2009,  an NDA was to be filed by the  end of 2010  [&lt;ulink linkID="1060875" linkType="Reference"&gt;1060875&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In April 2010, an NDA was expected to be filed in the last quarter of 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1090589" linkType="Reference"&gt;1090589&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2010, the NDA was to be filed in the first quarter of 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1118628" linkType="Reference"&gt;1118628&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in November 2010, the NDA was expected to be filed in the first half of 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1149680" linkType="Reference"&gt;1149680&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in January 2011, launch was expected in the US in 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1164038" linkType="Reference"&gt;1164038&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2011, the FDA granted the company a pre-NDA meeting, to be held on March 22, 2011  [&lt;ulink linkID="1169595" linkType="Reference"&gt;1169595&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2011, a pre-NDA meeting was held with the FDA. The agency reviewed several critical components of the filing and provided feedback. At that time, a submission was expected in mid-2011 following completion of data analysis [&lt;ulink linkID="1179705" linkType="Reference"&gt;1179705&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2011, QRxPharma expected to file an NDA in August 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1200018" linkType="Reference"&gt;1200018&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2011, an NDA was filed with the FDA for moderate-to-severe pain under the 505(b)(2) pathway. At that time, technical data were to follow in August 2011 and data from study 022 were to be added later in 2011. Approval and launch were expected in 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1208053" linkType="Reference"&gt;1208053&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in August 2011, the company submitted the clinical data package to support the filed NDA and requested a priority FDA review for the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="1217530" linkType="Reference"&gt;1217530&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2011, the FDA accepted the NDA for review and set a PDUFA date for June 25, 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1237279" linkType="Reference"&gt;1237279&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2012, the FDA issued a complete response letter and requested for additional information with regard to the safety and effectiveness of the drug and granted a meeting to clarify the steps required for approval [&lt;ulink linkID="1304683" linkType="Reference"&gt;1304683&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2012,  the FDA requested additional data from the trials including data from study 022. At that time, the company expected response from FDA by mid-2013 after its refiling [&lt;ulink linkID="1316823" linkType="Reference"&gt;1316823&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in January 2013, the company planned for for NDA resubmission by March 2013 and a PDUFA date was set for  the third quarter of 2013. At that time, FDA expected a more extensive analysis of study 022  during the resubmission. At that time, launch was expected in the third quarter of 2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1357310" linkType="Reference"&gt;1357310&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2013, the NDA, which included  a comprehensive analysis of study 022, and the results of five other phase II and III trials,  was resubmitted and the company expected a notification by the FDA regarding the PDUFA date and also regarding the Advisory Committee meeting, by the end of the first quarter of 2013. At that time, approval was expected in the third quarter of 2013 and launch was expected before the end of 2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1387434" linkType="Reference"&gt;1387434&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2013, the FDA had accepted the resubmitted NDA and set the PDUFA date for August 26, 2013. At that time, the Advisory Committee meeting was expected to take place between late June and late July [&lt;ulink linkID="1392052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1392052&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in May 2013, the FDA had set July 17, 2013 for the Advisory Committee meeting to review respiratory safety data comparing MoxDuo with components [&lt;ulink linkID="1423296" linkType="Reference"&gt;1423296&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in June 2013, reviews of data from study 022 showed that the timing of electronically collected oxygen desaturation information at one trial site did not accurately reflect the local time zone or changes relating to daylight savings time in 17% of patients. This led to displacement of electronic oxygen desaturation data relative to nurse-reported events by 1 or 2 h of the 48-hour study. Based on this review, the company reported that it would perform further analysis of  data from study 022 and submit a revised NDA to the FDA [&lt;ulink linkID="1444687" linkType="Reference"&gt;1444687&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2013, the  FDA  issued a complete response letter   and requested to evaluate respiratory safety data  from study 022.  The company planned to refile the application  in the fourth quarter of 2013 and anticipated  a new PDUFA date  in the second quarter of 2014, and also an "end of review" meeting  with the FDA was planned in the "coming weeks". At that time, the company planned to launch the drug in 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1470198" linkType="Reference"&gt;1470198&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2013, the company reported the results from its end-of-review meeting with the FDA. The FDA encouraged the company to submit validated data and updated NDA following which PDUFA date would be set after 6 months of resubmission. At that time, the company planned to re-file NDA by mid-November  2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1486092" linkType="Reference"&gt;1486092&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2013, the company completed analysis of respiratory safety data from study 022 and refiled its NDA with additional documents requested by the FDA. By that time, the FDA had confirmed that study 008 satisfied safety requirements and the studies submitted in the initial NDA had no identified safety or efficacy issues. At that time, the company anticipated for an Advisory Committee meeting after the expected PDUFA  date   in 'late May 2014' with approval expected in the second quarter of 2014 and launch in the second half of 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1503195" linkType="Reference"&gt;1503195&lt;/ulink&gt;].

At that time, the company was planning to request a meeting with the FDA to clarify the steps required for approval [&lt;ulink linkID="1562060" linkType="Reference"&gt;1562060&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2014, the company provided feedback on the end-of-review meeting with the FDA during which feasibility, overall approach for registration of the drug, potential study design and the number of clinical studies were discussed. At that time, the company planned to utilize the FDA guidance to determine the regulatory path for approval of the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="1576757" linkType="Reference"&gt;1576757&lt;/ulink&gt;]. in August 2014, the US FDA rejected the NDA for the third time and suggested the company to conduct a repeat phase II trial and one or more phase III trials.

Dosing was expected to complete in the second quarter of 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1163008" linkType="Reference"&gt;1163008&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2011, the company expected the additional data of the phase III study [&lt;ulink linkID="1169595" linkType="Reference"&gt;1169595&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in April 2011, enrollment in the safety and tolerability trial was completed. Top-line data from the trial were to be reported in June 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1186777" linkType="Reference"&gt;1186777&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2011, results were reported showing that respiratory depression, the primary endpoint, was less severe and of shorter duration in patients on MoxDuo IR, than in those on morphine or oxycodone. The rate of moderate to severe vomiting was 32 and 42% in the MoxDuo IR and oxycodone groups, respectively. Rates for morphine were comparable to those for MoxDuo IR.  The incidence of nausea was less frequent with MoxDuo IR than with morphine or oxycodone; however, differences were not significant [&lt;ulink linkID="1200018" linkType="Reference"&gt;1200018&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later in June 2011, further data were reported. Results demonstrated that desaturations occurred in 12, 15 and 3% of morphine, oxycodone and MoxDuo treated patients, respectively. The relative risk ratio observed was 4 : 1 or 5 : 1 for morphine or oxycodone versus MoxDuo [&lt;ulink linkID="1204214" linkType="Reference"&gt;1204214&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2011, the study was completed and the drug  was found to be safe [&lt;ulink linkID="1241429" linkType="Reference"&gt;1241429&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By April 2009, QRx planned to file an SPA for a phase III trial in patients undergoing joint replacement surgery in the third quarter of that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1067805" linkType="Reference"&gt;1067805&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2009, a final, double-blind, controlled, phase III study (Q8003-009) to assess the effectiveness of Q-8003IR in total knee replacement surgery patients was  to begin in the first quarter of  2010  [&lt;ulink linkID="1060875" linkType="Reference"&gt;1060875&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2010, the trial (Study 009, &lt;ulink linkID="63776" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01055015&lt;/ulink&gt;, Q8003-009) began in the US. The randomized, double-blind trial would recruit 140 patients, who would receive iv morphine analgesia until the day after knee replacement surgery. After that time, patients would be randomized to receive a flexible  MoxDuo IR regimen (starting at 12 mg morphine/8 mg oxycodone) or a fixed low-dose control (6 mg morphine/4 mg oxycodone loading dose followed by 3 mg/2 mg) dosed every 4 to 6 h for 48 h. The primary endpoint was difference in pain intensity over the treatment period; secondary endpoints included safety, time to onset of analgesia, global assessment of efficacy and supplemental analgesic use. The trial was scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1074368" linkType="Reference"&gt;1074368&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1169698" linkType="Reference"&gt;1169698&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2010, dosing in the study was expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1090589" linkType="Reference"&gt;1090589&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By September 2010, the study was over halfway complete and at that time, an analysis showed that the planned enrollment count of 140 patients, would be sufficient to demonstrate differences in analgesic effect. Analysis of the study was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1127795" linkType="Reference"&gt;1127795&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2010, results were expected in December 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1140156" linkType="Reference"&gt;1140156&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2010, enrollment in the trial was completed. At that time, topline data were expected in February 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1154187" linkType="Reference"&gt;1154187&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2010, the  phase III trial was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1169698" linkType="Reference"&gt;1169698&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2011,    data from the completed study showed that  patients who received the flexible  MoxDuo IR regimen reported greater reductions in pain intensity scores compared with those in the low dose group [&lt;ulink linkID="1169595" linkType="Reference"&gt;1169595&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2011, further data were presented at the 30th Annual Scientific Meeting of the APS in Austin, TX. Of the 146 patients randomized, 142 were included in the safety and intent-to-treat population.  During 0 to 48 h interval, 60.3 and 51.4% of patients in the flexible and low dose arms, respectively, were considered responders.  Oxygen desaturation was reported by 22.1 and 18.9% of patients in the flexible and low dose arms, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1216235" linkType="Reference"&gt;1216235&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2008, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, fixed dose factorial, efficacy and safety study (&lt;ulink linkID="47416" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00831051&lt;/ulink&gt;; Q8003-021) of Q8003 12mg/8 mg and Q8003 6 mg/4 mg versus its individual morphine sulfate and oxycodone hydrochloride components for the management of acute moderate to severe postoperative pain following bunionectomy surgery in patients (n = 197) was initiated. In February 2009, the study was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1226604" linkType="Reference"&gt;1226604&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2011, clinical  data were presented at the 30th Annual Scientific Meeting of the APS in Austin, TX. A meta-analysis was performed with respiratory data obtained from  the study, on respiratory depression  in a post-operative setting.  Subjects (n = 975) received placebo (n = 60), MoxDuo (n = 433) and morphine or oxycodone alone (n = 482); a cumulative morphine equivalent dose (MED) of 12, 24 or &amp;gt;/= 30 mg were received by 71.5% of subjects in MoxDuo group that was at least twice that of morphine or oxycodone groups (6 to 12 or 24 mg). The rate of oxygen desaturation (SpO2) was 4.6% for 24 mg MED of MoxDuo compared with 2.5% for 12 mg MED of MoxDuo. The median number of episodes of SpO2 &amp;lt; 90% was lower for  MoxDuo. At an MED of 12 mg, the incidence of SpO2 &amp;lt; 90% was similar across all groups. The incidence rate of SpO2 &amp;lt; 90% was higher  for subjects located in higher altitudes [&lt;ulink linkID="1216238" linkType="Reference"&gt;1216238&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2008, the company's final phase III studies were expected to be 'initiated shortly' to complete the FDA's required NDA data package. At that time, the filing was slated for 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="908826" linkType="Reference"&gt;908826&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2008, the FDA approved the design of the trial and agreed that only two phase III trials would be needed for NDA filing, with no pharmacology, toxicology or long-term safety studies required. The trial was to recruit patients following bunionectomy or knee replacement surgery [&lt;ulink linkID="931779" linkType="Reference"&gt;931779&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2008, QRx submitted an SPA request to the FDA for  a phase III protocol comparing MoxDuo IR to its individual components in bunionectomy patients. The agency's response was expected by March 2009. By January, the company planned to submit SPA requests for the two remaining phase III trials [&lt;ulink linkID="1067802" linkType="Reference"&gt;1067802&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2009, the request was updated with data from a pilot phase III trial; the FDA was expected to respond by August 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="1067811" linkType="Reference"&gt;1067811&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2009, it was announced that one of the two final phase III studies would be a double-blind combination rule trial (study 008) in patients who had undergone bunionectomy surgery and the second would be a double-blind controlled study in patients who had undergone total knee surgery [&lt;ulink linkID="1037091" linkType="Reference"&gt;1037091&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1470198" linkType="Reference"&gt;1470198&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2009, the company planned to initiate a randomized, double-blind, active control, US, phase III trial (&lt;ulink linkID="62090" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01016808&lt;/ulink&gt;; Q8003-008). The study would compare safety and efficacy of Q-8003IR with its component doses of oxycodone and morphine in patients (expected n = 522). The primary endpoint would be difference in pain intensity scores baseline. The study was expected to start in December 2009 and to complete in April 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1059316" linkType="Reference"&gt;1059316&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later in November 2009, the trial was initiated. Patients would  receive  Q-8003IR  12 mg/8 mg versus 12 mg of morphine and 8 mg of oxycodone every 6 h for 48 h. The secondary endpoints included the patient's global assessment of effect,  the amount of supplemental analgesia (acetaminophen) used, and the incidence and intensity of opioid-related adverse effects. At that time,  dosing was expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1060875" linkType="Reference"&gt;1060875&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2010, the study was completed and results were reported showing that the primary endpoint was acheived, with pain reduction with Q-8003IR being significantly better than either of its component doses of oxycodone and morphine, both over the 48 h treatment period and during the first 24 h of dosing [&lt;ulink linkID="1090589" linkType="Reference"&gt;1090589&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were reported in May 2010. Use of supplemental analgesia was two-to-three-fold higher in the morphine and oxycodone groups; despite this pain reduction in these groups was lower than in the MoxDuo IR arm. MoxDuo IR was well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1095918" linkType="Reference"&gt;1095918&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2010, it was reported that Q-8003IR demonstrated a statistically superior analgesic effect compared to morphine and oxycodone alone, as well as a favourable side effect profile [&lt;ulink linkID="1145334" linkType="Reference"&gt;1145334&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2011, meta-analysis  data were presented at the 30th Annual Scientific Meeting of the APS in Austin, TX. Subjects  (n = 975) who underwent bunionectomy surgery, on respiratory depression  in a post-operative setting received placebo (n = 60), MoxDuo (n = 433) and morphine or oxycodone alone (n = 482); a cumulative morphine equivalent dose (MED) of 12, 24 or &amp;gt;/= 30 mg were received by 71.5% of subjects in MoxDuo group that was at least twice that of morphine or oxycodone groups (6 to 12 or 24 mg). The rate of oxygen desaturation (SpO2) was 4.6% for 24 mg MED of MoxDuo compared with 2.5% for 12 mg MED of MoxDuo. The median number of episodes of SpO2 &amp;lt; 90% was lower for  MoxDuo. At an MED of 12 mg, the incidence of SpO2 &amp;lt; 90% was similar across all groups. The incidence rate of SpO2 &amp;lt; 90% was higher  for subjects located in higher altitudes [&lt;ulink linkID="1216238" linkType="Reference"&gt;1216238&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2013, similar results were published [&lt;ulink linkID="1507166" linkType="Reference"&gt;1507166&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2009, data were reported from a randomized, double-blind, US pilot, phase III trial comparing the efficacy and safety of Q-8003IR with its component doses of morphine and oxycodone. In the study, 197 patients were treated with either Q-8003IR, morphine or oxycodone 24 h post-bunionectomy every 6 h for 48 h when pain reached a measure of 4 or above on the numerical pain scale. Q-8003IR significantly reduced pain compared to both morphine or oxycodone alone and resulted in fewer side effects. The drug reduced pain intensity scores by 80 to 100% compared with the monotherapy compounds meeting the primary endpoint of the study. Furthermore, patients receiving morphine or oxycodone alone were 2 to 4 times more likely to prematurely discontinue dosing than those on the optimal dose ratio for efficacy and tolerability which was determined to be 12 mg of morphine plus 8 mg of oxycodone. These results would provide sample size guidance for the upcoming phase III combination rule study required for NDA submission in 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1001515" linkType="Reference"&gt;1001515&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2007, a phase III extension trial began. In the placebo-controlled, double-blind trial (&lt;ulink linkID="12772" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00565760&lt;/ulink&gt;; Q8003-010), patients would receive the drug for 28 days, followed by a withdrawal period of up to 3 weeks during which doses would be reduced. The primary endpoint was safety and to generate a side effect profile of Q-8003IR. The trial would enroll patients from the company's 250-patient phase III trial for acute post-bunionectomy surgery pain; the study was completed in March 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="862601" linkType="Reference"&gt;862601&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="860914" linkType="Reference"&gt;860914&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2007, QRxPharma initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, US phase III trial (&lt;ulink linkID="12686" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00560183&lt;/ulink&gt;; Q8003-007). The study would compare the safety and efficacy of four doses of Q-8003IR with placebo in 250 patients experiencing moderate-to-severe pain following bunionectomy. The primary endpoint would be the difference in pain relief and pain intensity scores over the 48 h following surgery. Secondary endpoints  included time-to-onset of analgesia, duration of effect from a single oral dose, and safety. The trial was expected to be completed in April 2008. A safety extension trial would begin following enrollment into the first trial in order to obtain longer-term safety data. At that time, several phase III trials were anticipated [&lt;ulink linkID="854903" linkType="Reference"&gt;854903&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="854706" linkType="Reference"&gt;854706&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2008, the company reported positive initial data. The primary endpoint of change in pain intensity over the 48-h dosing period was met with 50% of subjects receiving Q-80031R reporting a good to excellent improvement in pain intensity compared with only 13% in the placebo group. The median dose received within a treatment group ranged from 3 mg/2 mg to 9 mg/6 mg of morphine/oxycodone every 4 h. The drug was well tolerated, with minimal somnolence and changes to respiratory parameters reported [&lt;ulink linkID="902731" linkType="Reference"&gt;902731&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2008, further data were presented. A total of 58% of patients treated with 12 mg morphine plus 8 mg oxycodone reported good to excellent global improvement, compared with 12% of placebo-treated patients. The greatest reduction in pain intensity scores was also seen in this arm, with patients' baseline pain scores of 6.6 units falling to 4.6 units, compared with a 0.14 unit increase in placebo-treated patients. The mean time to pain relief and duration time of analgesic effect was 42 min and 6.6 h in Q-8003IR-treated patients, compared to 4.4 and 2.8 h in placebo-treated patients. The 12 mg/8 mg dose was well tolerated, with an 8% rate of patient withdrawal, compared with a 6% rate in the placebo group. A total of 2% of 12 mg/8 mg-treated patients experienced somnolence. A total of 56% of 12 mg/8 mg-treated patients experienced mild-to-moderate nausea; No incidences of severe nausea were reported, however, 32% of patients reported vomiting (18% mild-to-moderate and 14% severe) and 20% of patients experienced mild-to-moderate dizziness. No incidences of severe dizziness were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="908826" linkType="Reference"&gt;908826&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2011, meta-analysis  data were presented at the 30th Annual Scientific Meeting of the APS in Austin, TX. Subjects  (n = 975) who underwent bunionectomy surgery, on respiratory depression  in a post-operative setting received placebo (n = 60), MoxDuo (n = 433) and morphine or oxycodone alone (n = 482); a cumulative morphine equivalent dose (MED) of 12, 24 or &amp;gt;/= 30 mg were received by 71.5% of subjects in MoxDuo group that was at least twice that of morphine or oxycodone groups (6 to 12 or 24 mg). The rate of oxygen desaturation (SpO2) was 4.6% for 24 mg MED of MoxDuo compared with 2.5% for 12 mg MED of MoxDuo. The median number of episodes of SpO2 &amp;lt; 90% was lower for  MoxDuo. At an MED of 12 mg, the incidence of SpO2 &amp;lt; 90% was similar across all groups.

Patients would be treated with Q-8003IR every 4 to 6 h over a 48-h period. Data would be used to further establish the optimal dose regimen for Q-8003IR, select an appropriate control group, and design an upcoming pivotal phase III trial in patients following total knee replacement surgery. Dosing was expected to be completed in April 2009  [&lt;ulink linkID="985368" linkType="Reference"&gt;985368&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="988358" linkType="Reference"&gt;988358&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In August 2009, the open-label, 44-patient trial was completed, meeting all of its primary endpoints, which included analgesic efficacy against Percocet. In the Q-8003IR group there were fewer cases of moderate to severe nausea, vomiting, hypotension and constipation, and greater overall tolerability than in the Percocet group. Significantly greater pain relief was achieved in patients on a flexible dosing regimen of Q-8003IR, than in those on a fixed low dose of 2 or 3 mg (p &amp;lt; 0.05) [&lt;ulink linkID="1037091" linkType="Reference"&gt;1037091&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2010, similar results were reported.
