Patients treated in the real-world setting were treated earlier and experienced a significantly faster time to resolution and shorter attack duration. Median time to treatment was 1.8 h in the IOS group and 6.5 h in the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="57395"&gt;FAST-3&lt;/ulink&gt; trial (p &amp;lt; 0.001), median time to resolution was 4.3  versus 8 h respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and median duration of attack 7.8  versus 16.9 h (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Patients from both environments who were treated by a health care professional were compared as a sub-study; self-administered patients were shown to treat their attacks faster. However, results were similar to those found when self-administered patients were included: median time to treatment was 1.7  versus 6.5 h (p &amp;lt; 0.001); median time to resolution was 3.5  versus 8 h (p &amp;lt; 0.0001); and median duration of attack was 7.3  versus 16.9 h  (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) for IOS and &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="57395"&gt;FAST-3&lt;/ulink&gt;,  respectively. Further results were presented in February 2013.     Significantly shorter  duration of attack was observed in patients patients treated &amp;lt; 1 h compared to those treated &gt;/= 1 h after attack onset (p &amp;lt; 0.001).  There was a significant reduction in   duration of attack treated &amp;lt;  2 h compared to &gt;/= 2 h  (p &amp;lt;0.001) and attacks treated &amp;lt; 5 h compared to &gt;/= 5 h  after attack onset (p &amp;lt; 0.001).  Attacks treated &amp;lt; 1 h resolved significantly faster compared to attacks treated 1 h after attack onset (p = 0.033).  Attack duration was significantly shorter for self treated compared to  health care professional (HCP) treated attacks. Further results were presented in February  2013. Patients with HAE with normal C1-INH  received the drug sooner when self administered compared to administration by HCP (p = 0.046), whereas, time to injection was  not significantly affected by the administrator in patients with HAE  type I/II.  In patients with HAE   with normal C1-INH,  significantly longer time was taken to resolve compared to  patients with   HAE  type I/II (p &amp;lt; 0.001).

A total of 93.1% of the attacks were treated with a single Firazyr injection. Of 289 attacks that required Firazyr reinjection, 199 were severe/very severe. Of 256 laryngeal attacks, 16 required reinjection. In patients using long-term prophylaxis (LTP) versus not using LTP, reinjection was significantly more likely (8.0 versus 6.3% respectively; p = 0.023). For attacks of higher severity, reinjection was significantly more likely (odds ratio of 2.2, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). In patients lower BMI (&amp;lt;/= 25 kg/m2) versus higher BMI (&gt;/= 25 kg/m2), reinjection was more likely, although not significantly (odds ratio of 1.4; p = 0.1479).

A total of 71 subjects experienced qualifying attacks and were randomized to blinded study drug (36 &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt;, 35 placebo); only the 71 randomized subjects were analyzed for efficacy. An additional 12 subjects were never randomized but received open-label &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; for treatment of laryngeal angioedema and/or prior to emergency surgical procedures. Of the 35 subjects randomized to placebo, 23 also received &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; (eg, rescue, open-label). In total, 83 subjects received at least one dose of study drug and were analyzed for safety; 71 subjects were exposed to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; (59 randomized, 12 open-label only) and 12 subjects were exposed only to placebo.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The primary endpoints were time until the beginning of unequivocal relief of the defining symptom following initial treatment, and the number of attacks of angioedema during each treatment phase. Secondary endpoints included quality of life, average severity of attacks, the average duration of attacks and the presence or absence of unequivocal beginning of relief of the defining symptom within 4 h of treatment. Enrolled patients were suffering from moderate to severe acute HAE attacks in the face, abdomen or genitals. The patient treatment phase of the study was completed in January 2007. Patients (n = 24) were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; followed by placebo or placebo followed by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt;. All the patients received twice-weekly treatment with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; for a 12-week period and twice-weekly treatment with placebo for a 12-week period. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/ProtocolDescription&gt;</Description><OutcomeSummary>&lt;Outcomes&gt;&lt;para&gt;Results presented in March 2007 showed  that primary endpoint and also  secondary endpoints were  met using the protocol-defined intent to treat analysis. The time-to-sustained relief of acute HAE symptoms was reduced from more than 4 h for placebo to 2 h for the drug (p = 0.026). &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; was effective across all attack sites, including the face, abdomen and genitals and even laryngeal attacks, which were treated open-label  [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="774286"&gt;774286&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="850105"&gt;850105&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Results presented in March 2008 showed  that primary endpoint was met with a 53% reduction in the number of attacks in the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; group (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The secondary endpoints also showed highly significant differences in favor of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt;, including a 66% reduction in days of swelling (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and reductions in the average severity of attacks (p = 0.0008) and average duration of attacks (p = 0.0004).  No immunogenicity and no decrease in efficacy was observed [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="829053"&gt;829053&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="887841"&gt;887841&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Results presented in August 2010 showed that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; significantly reduced the frequency of hereditary angioedema attacks (p&amp;lt; 0.001), in addition to reducing the severity and duration of attacks, the need for open-label rescue therapy and the total number of days of swelling compared to patients receiving placebo. Patients administered &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt;  experienced a significant reduction in the time to unequivocal relief of symptoms versus those receiving placebo (p = 0.02). During the two 12-week, crossover periods the average normalized attack rates for all 22 subjects were 6.26 and 12.73 for the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; and placebo treatments, respectively. The estimated average difference in attack rates between &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; and placebo was 6.47 (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Than during placebo, the mean score for the severity of attacks was significantly lower during &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; prophylaxis  (1.3 +/- 0.85 versus 1.9 +/- 0.36, p = 0.001). The total duration of attacks was also shorter with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; prophylaxis compared to placebo (2.1 +/- 1.13 versus 3.4 +/- 1.39 days, p = 0.002). The number of subjects requiring open-label rescue therapy was less with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; prophylaxis (11 versus 22), as was the total number of open-label injections (4.7 +/- 8.66 versus 15.4 +/- 8.41 injections, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and the total number of days of swelling (10.1 +/- 10.73 versus 29.6 +/- 16.9 days; p &amp;lt; 0.001) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1121639"&gt;1121639&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1121897"&gt;1121897&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2017, pooled results were  presented from six clinical hereditary angioedema (HAE) studies (NCT00289211,  &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="61593"&gt;NCT01005888&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="21809"&gt;NCT00438815&lt;/ulink&gt; , &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="21810"&gt;NCT00462709&lt;/ulink&gt;,  &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="65223"&gt;NCT01095510&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="170961"&gt;NCT02052141&lt;/ulink&gt;). Overall, an increase was observed in C1-INH functional activity and antigen levels. In children and adults, generally similar pharmacokinetic profiles were observed for C1-INH doses. With multiple doses, C1-INH accumulation was not observed. A total of 75 to 100% of children aged 6 to 11 years achieved symptom relief from HAE attacks after treatment with C1-INH. At &amp;lt;/= 72 h post administration of C1-INH, of 40 medical procedures, no HAE attacks were observed for 39 medical procedures. A 79 to 88% reduction in number of HAE attacks were observed in C1-INH concentrate treated children aged 6 to 11 years; and also in children aged 2 to 5 years, the results were similar.

Sinusitis, nasopharyngitis, streptococcal pharyngitis, HAE, constipation, cough, rash and bronchitis were the most common adverse events observed in 3 to 5% of the patients. There were no hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, related to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt;. HBV, HCV and HIV testing revealed no evidence of viral transmission [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1199541"&gt;1199541&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2017, pooled results from LEVP 2006-1, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="21810"&gt;LEVP 2006-4&lt;/ulink&gt;, and  &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="170961"&gt;0624-301&lt;/ulink&gt;,  0624-203 (2 to 5 years, n = 3; 6 to 11 years, n = 32; 12 to 17 years, n = 26)   were presented. Headache, nausea, pyrexia, and infusion site erythema were the adverse reactions that were due to Cinryze in children. These adverse reactions were not severe and did not led to discontinuation of the drug. The safety and tolerability of Cinryze was found to be similar among children, adolescents, and adults [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1908965"&gt;1908965&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2017, pooled results were  presented from six clinical hereditary angioedema (HAE) studies (NCT00289211,  NCT01005888, NCT00438815 , NCT00462709,  NCT01095510 and NCT02052141). In patients, treatment with C1-INH concentrate was generally well tolerated; and mostly mild or moderately severe treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) like headache, nausea, pyrexia, and infusion site erythema were reported. Severe TEAEs possibly related to the study drug were not reported, and drug discontinuation due to TEAEs was not observed.

If there was no response to treatment 60 min after the first dose, a second 1000 U dose would be administered. The study design also allowed for short-term prophylaxis with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; prior to emergency or non-cosmetic surgical or dental procedures and an additional 12 patients would receive &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; only for this purpose [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1100105"&gt;1100105&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1121639"&gt;1121639&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1121897"&gt;1121897&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1199541"&gt;1199541&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/ProtocolDescription&gt;</Description><OutcomeSummary>&lt;Outcomes&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2010, results were presented. Using a conservative definition of response, substantial relief was achieved in 87% of HAE attacks; however, using a less conservative definition of substantial relief as either three consecutive reports of symptom improvement, or improvement of the defining symptom followed by cessation of symptom assessments, substantial relief was achieved in 95% of HAE attacks within 4 h. In addition, there was no loss of efficacy with subsequent repeat administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt;. During the study, 84 laryngeal attacks occurred; however, none required intubation following &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1100105"&gt;1100105&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2010, further results were published. The estimated median time to the onset of unequivocal relief was 2 h for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt;-treated patients (p = 0.02) compared to greater than 4 h for placebo-treated patients. The onset of unequivocal relief occurred within 4 h in 21 patients in the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; group and in 14 patients in the placebo group (60 versus 42.4%, p = 0.062). However, the difference between the groups was not significant. The median time to complete resolution significantly shorter for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; treated patients compare to placebo (12.3 versus 25 h, p = 0.004). C1 inhibitor antigenic and functional levels increased during treatment in patients who received &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt;, but not in placebo-treated patients. No significant changes in C4 levels were observed [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1121639"&gt;1121639&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1121897"&gt;1121897&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2011, results were presented. Of the 77 patients in the trial who had experienced gastrointestinal (GI) attacks, 97% achieved relief within 4 h of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; administration &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"/&gt;and the median time to beginning of relief was 30 min.     &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; efficacy did not diminish with repeated administration in patients treated for more than one GI attack.  Of the 51 &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt;-treated patients with facial and extremity attacks, 96% achieved relief within 4 h. Median time to beginning of relief (30 min for both GI and facial and extremity subgroups) was comparable to the overall median response time for all attacks at all anatomic locations in the study [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1199541"&gt;1199541&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2017, results were presented.

      prophylactic therapy to lower the HAE attack rate in patients who were not adequately
      controlled at the recommended &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; dosing regimen.
There would  be three potential dose escalation steps of 12-week period each:
&lt;br/&gt;Step 1:   subjects would receive &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt;  1500 U iv biw.&lt;br/&gt;Step 2:  subjects would receive &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; 2000 U iv biw.&lt;br/&gt;Step 3:  subjects would receive &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; 2500 U
      iv biw.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Each step would consist of 12 weeks of safety monitoring, followed by calculation of average monthly angioedema attack rate based on subject reports of angioedema symptoms (regardless of intensity) and actual duration of therapy for that step.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;If a subject was deemed a 'success' at a given step and the investigator and medical monitor would determine that it was safe for the subject to continue on that dose, the subject would enter a 3 month follow-up period at that dose level with continued safety monitoring. The subject could not re-enter the study for purposes of dose escalation during the follow-up period.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;If a subject was not deemed a 'success,' the subject would initiate the next highest step of the dose escalation algorithm provided that the investigator and medical monitor would agree that dose escalation was appropriate. If at the end of step 3 (2500 units), a subject was not deemed a 'success,' then the week 12 visit would represent study completion and the subject would be  referred to the physician who managed their HAE care.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/ProtocolDescription&gt;</Description><OutcomeSummary>&lt;Outcomes&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2012, results showed that   &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; was well tolerated at all dose levels and the safety profile at  doses up to 2500 units was consistent with previous clinical trials at lower doses. There were no systemic thrombotic events and  discontinuations in the study. Most of the adverse events (AEs)  were mild to moderate in intensity. A total of two patients had   treatment-related  AEs (one with localized blood clot in a port-a-cath on day 81 treated with streptokinase, catheter-site pain on first day of dosing of two dose escalation steps, and dyspnea on day 173; and one with muscle spasm).

The analysis was conducted to evaluate how the use of attenuated androgens (AA) impacted the outcome of subjects while on &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;C1INH-nf&lt;/ulink&gt;. Of 22 subjects, 8  were using AA for prophylaxis with a mean historical attack rate of 13.88 per 12 weeks.  Of these eight subjects, five discontinued AA use prior to randomization. Among these five, the mean number of attacks over the 12-week placebo period was 15, compared to 6.8 attacks during the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;C1INH-nf&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment period; which represented a  decrease of 54.7% in attack rate which was similar to the reduction in attack rate (52%) from the overall study population [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1429129"&gt;1429129&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2014, results were presented. Patients treated with C1INH-nf had 2-fold reduction in the mean number of attacks (6.25 attacks per 12-week period) when compared with placebo (12.73 attacks per 12-week period). In the C1INH-nf group, mean short-form 36 scores were greater when compared with placebo and baseline.

At steady state, mean minimum concentration and Cmax were 0.422 and 0.718 U/ml in patients receiving 1000 U C1-INH, which indicated a substantial increase in plasma circulating levels with chronic treatment. During 12-weeks of treatment, patients who had &amp;lt; 2 and &amp;lt;1 attacks/month were 86 and 76% in C1-INH (1000 U) group, respectively, with plasma Cmax levels 0.394 to 1.096 U/ml for both; and 34% of patients were attack free with plasma Cmax levels of 0.476 to 1.096 U/ml, suggested that increased C1-INH plasma levels following C1-INH treatment more effectively prevented attacks.

Eventhough exogenous Cinryze-treated patients achieved supraphysiological levels throughout, endogenous Cinryze measured before and after plasmapheresis (PP) demonstrated decreased functional Cinryze serum concentration by 43.3% (p &amp;lt; 0.05) for both cohorts (Cinryze and placebo) associated with PP [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1927006"&gt;1927006&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Outcomes&gt;</OutcomeSummary><References>0624-201; 2012-000441-12; NCT01147302</References><TreatmentSummary>&lt;Regimens&gt;&lt;para&gt;Patients (n = 18) received 20, 000 units of Cinryze or placebo (Cinryze n = 9, placebo n = 9) in divided doses every other day for 2 weeks [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1927006"&gt;1927006&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Regimens&gt;</TreatmentSummary><Indications>Kidney transplant rejection</Indications><Drugs>Cinryze</Drugs></Row><Row><ProtocolTitle>Effect of C1-esterase Inhibitor on Systemic Inflammation in Trauma Patients With a Femur or Pelvic Fracture</ProtocolTitle><TrialStatus>Terminated</TrialStatus><Trial id="73822"></Trial><DevStatus id="C3">Phase 3 Clinical</DevStatus><AdverseSummary></AdverseSummary><Description>&lt;ProtocolDescription&gt;&lt;para&gt;Patients were  randomized to receive either placebo (saline 0.9%) or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cetor&lt;/ulink&gt; 200 U/kg iv  infusion over 30 min, just before the start of the femur or pelvic fixation operation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1246961"&gt;1246961&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/ProtocolDescription&gt;</Description><OutcomeSummary></OutcomeSummary><References>34932; CAESAR; EudraCT: 2010-024327-24; NCT01275976</References><TreatmentSummary></TreatmentSummary><Indications>Inflammatory disease</Indications><Drugs>Cinryze</Drugs></Row><Row><ProtocolTitle>A European, Post-Authorization, Observational Study Of Patients With Hereditary Angioedema</ProtocolTitle><TrialStatus>Completed</TrialStatus><Trial id="85360"></Trial><DevStatus id="NS">Phase not specified</DevStatus><AdverseSummary></AdverseSummary><Description>&lt;ProtocolDescription&gt;&lt;para&gt;Patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) in Europe who were receiving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="54366"&gt;Cinryze&lt;/ulink&gt; in routine clinical practice for prevention or treatment of angioedema attacks would be included in this study.  Approximately 20 sites would be  planned for enrollment.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/ProtocolDescription&gt;</Description><OutcomeSummary></OutcomeSummary><References>0624-401; NCT01541423; SHP616-401</References><TreatmentSummary></TreatmentSummary><Indications>Hereditary angioedema</Indications><Drugs>Cinryze</Drugs></Row></ns2:com.thomsonreuters.ls.service.contract.analytics.v2.soap.AnalyticsOutputV2>
