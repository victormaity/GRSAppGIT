From week 0 to 18, in SIRROUND-D and -T studies, SAEs like pneumonia and cellulitis were most commonly reported. Sirukumab was well tolerated in patients with moderately to severely active RA. Overall, no dose relationship was observed between sirukumab 50 mg q4w and 100 mg q2w for types or frequencies of adverse events [&lt;ulink linkID="1935590" linkType="Reference"&gt;1935590&lt;/ulink&gt;].   Further post hoc analysis data were presented at same conference.

Further data were presented at the same conference. In 18-week placebo-controlled period of SIRROUND-D and –T studies, grade or frequency of neutropenia did not exhibit any dose relationship. Decrease in neutrophils began at week 2 and remained stable which over time. Transient grade 3/4 neutropenia was resolved without recurrence after dose interruption or resolved within the dosing interval such that no change in dose schedule was required. In long-term neutropenia analysis across five phase III studies, no correlation was observed between majority of grade 4 decreases in neutrophils and infections  [&lt;ulink linkID="1935775" linkType="Reference"&gt;1935775&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2016, clinical data from four phase III studies (SIRROUND-M, -D, -T and -H) which evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects of sirukumab were presented at the 80th ACR Annual Meeting in Washington DC. Serum samples from healthy controls (n = 230) and patients (n = 1, 193) were collected at baseline and week 4 across the four studies. In the SIRROUND studies patients received sirukumab (100 mg q2w or 50 mg q4w) or placebo. Across all the studies, eight analytes (acute phase proteins, C-reactive protein, hepcidin, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 , S100 calcium-binding protein A12 and surfactant protein D) among the elevated analytes were suppressed by sirukumab (50 mg q4w and 100 mg q2w). Both doses of sirukumab showed similar changes in the analyte levels, the only exception was C-reactive protein in the SIRROUND-T study. Across multiple RA populations, sirukumab showed consistent decrease in the inflammatory proteins that were elevated at baseline [&lt;ulink linkID="1874108" linkType="Reference"&gt;1874108&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2017, further  post hoc analysis data were presented at the 18th EULAR Annual European Congress of Rheumatology, Madrid, Spain. In 50 mg q4w and 100 mg q2w sirukumab treatment group, patients who were anemic at baseline reported greater improvement in hemoglobin (11 to 16 g/l and 13 to 16 g/l increase, respectively). Regardless of baseline anemic status, in adalimumab and placebo groups, statistically significant increases in hemoglobin levels were not observed. By week 16, patients in both sirukumab dosage groups reported consistent reduction in prevalence of anemia [&lt;ulink linkID="1935793" linkType="Reference"&gt;1935793&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1937785" linkType="Reference"&gt;1937785&lt;/ulink&gt;].In October 2018, further data were presented at the 82nd ACR Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL. There were no correlations trends of increasing occurrences of events with higher sirukumab exposures for major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancy, death, serious infection, thrombocytopenia and triglyceride elevation in RA patients receiving up to 3.4 years of sirukumab treatment. Between sirukumab exposure and neutropenia, ALT elevation, LDL elevation, total cholesterol elevation, abnormal HDL or bilirubin elevation, weak correlations were observed, in patients treated with higher sirukumab [&lt;ulink linkID="2084253" linkType="Reference"&gt;2084253&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2016, clinical data from two global, phase III studies (SIRROUND-D, and SIRROUND-T) were presented at the 80th ACR Annual Meeting in Washington DC. Serum samples from baseline, week-4 and 24 were collected from the patients (n = 89; from Asia pacific, Europe and North America) in the SIRROUND-D and –T studies. Patients received sirukumab (100 mg, q2w or 50 mg, q4w). Compared with European and North American patients, the serum composite score, and individual rheumatoid arthritis-associated analytes including chemokine ligand-13, matrix metallopeptidase-3 and soluble programmed death-1 were found to be significantly elevated in the Asia pacific patients. In Asia pacific patients, stronger pharmacodynamic effects and significantly greater down regulation of both the serum composite score and IL-6 gene signature were observed at both 4 and 24-weeks post-treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="1873963" linkType="Reference"&gt;1873963&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further clinical data in 2548 patients were presented at the same conference. At week 24, the proportion of patients who achieved clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in short form-36 (SF-36)-physical component summary was 47.2 and 41.8 (sirukumab 50 mg), and 50.8 and 47.9 (sirukumab 100 mg) and 30.8 and 29.3% (placebo arms); in SF-36-mental component summary was 45.4 and 39 (sirukumab 50 mg), and 43.6 and 37.3 (sirukumab 100 mg), 36 and 27.2% (placebo arms); in the functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT)-fatigue score was 61.4 and 55.7 (sirukumab 50 mg), 59.4 and 55.8 (sirukumab 100 mg), and 43.9 and 40.5% (placebo arms) in DMARD-refractory and TNF-refractory patients, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1874130" linkType="Reference"&gt;1874130&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2017, further data were presented at the 18th EULAR Annual European Congress of Rheumatology, Madrid, Spain.  When compared to placebo, sirukumab-treated patients with PDMA had a significant improvement in core depressive symptoms in both studies.

In May 2011, data from the initial 12-weeks were presented at EULAR 2011 in London, UK. Patients treated with sirukumab showed a mean improvement from baseline. Moderate and good DAS28 (CRP) responses were achieved by 43.8 and 37.5% of the sirukumab group, respectively, compared with 21.1 and 10.5% of the placebo group. In the active treatment group, 75% of patients achieved ACR20 responses. Mean improvements for swollen and tender joint counts, physical function as assessed by HAQ-DI and serum CRP levels were significantly greater in sirukumab-treated patients.  Patient assessment of pain also improved, but not significantly. Sirukumab treatment led to greater improvements in morning stiffness than placebo and caused a greater increase in mean LDL cholesterol. Sirukumab was generally well-tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1194560" linkType="Reference"&gt;1194560&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1195847" linkType="Reference"&gt;1195847&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in November 2011, data from the part-B proof of concept trial  were reported. Data showed that sirukumab significantly improved signs and symptoms as measured by ACR50 response at week 12. Primary endpoint was achieved in 24% of patients in the combined sirukumab (100, 50 and 25 mg) group. Continued improvement at week-24 was seen in ACR50 response: 60% with 100 mg every 2 weeks; 50% with 100 mg every 4 weeks; 30% with 50 mg every 4 weeks and 36% with 25 mg every 4 weeks. The drug decreased up to 80% of CRP in patient's blood serum at week 2 through week-24. Sirukumab increased the serum hemoglobin levels in anemic patients and effected the hepcidin levels and markers of anemia. These data would be presented  at the 2011 American College of Rheumatology Annual Scientific Meeting in Chicago, IL [&lt;ulink linkID="1236966" linkType="Reference"&gt;1236966&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2012,  data were presented from the dose-ranging part of the study at EULAR 2012 in Berlin, Germany. The percentage of patients who achieved remission peaked at week 24 in the 100-mg sirukumab q2w (n = 30) and q4w (n = 30) groups and remained higher than week-12 rates at week 38. Highest remission rates (all three criteria) at all time points were seen in patients who received 100 mg q2w sirukumab throughout the study, with a statistically significant difference from placebo according to week 12 DAS28 (20%), and week 24 and 48 Boolean (13%) and SDAI scores (23%). Boolean-based remission rates were lower for all groups at all time points than simplified disease activity index-based ACR/EULAR criteria [&lt;ulink linkID="1296285" linkType="Reference"&gt;1296285&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data presented at this meeting showed that at week 12, the overall ACR50 response was 42% for sirkumab, compared with 3.3% for placebo. A total of 19 patients receiving sirukumab normalized hemoglobin by week 12 [&lt;ulink linkID="1296327" linkType="Reference"&gt;1296327&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data presented at the meeting showed that sirukumab had linear pharmacokinetics over a dose of 25 to 100 mg. Adverse events associated with patients receiving sirukumab included leucopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. A total of 4 of 136 patients developed antibodies to sirukumab by week 38 [&lt;ulink linkID="1296329" linkType="Reference"&gt;1296329&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the meeting that showed sirukumab-treated patients had higher short form-36 physical component summary scores and ACR core components, with the exception of tender joint count. A higher proportion of sirukumab-treated patients also achieved a health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI) response and improvement in HAQ-DI, compared with placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1299816" linkType="Reference"&gt;1299816&lt;/ulink&gt;].   In June 2015, further results were presented at the 16th EULAR Annual European Congress in Rome, Italy. In prevalent depressed mood and anhedonia patients, sirukumab improved the severity of core depression symptoms even after adjusting for RA severity and in RA nonresponders when compared to placebo. There was a correlation between higher soluble IL-6 receptor levels at baseline and significant improvement core depressive symptoms [&lt;ulink linkID="1668433" linkType="Reference"&gt;1668433&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2015, further clinical data were presented at the 28th ECNP Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. At week 12, sirukumab improved depressive symptoms and fatigue in prevalent depressed mood and anhedonia patients.  In RA non-responders, significant improvement in depressive symptoms was observed, but not  fatigue [&lt;ulink linkID="1687436" linkType="Reference"&gt;1687436&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2016, clinical data were presented from a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter, single-dose, phase I study (&lt;ulink linkID="176514" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02079545&lt;/ulink&gt;), performed to bridge the pharmacokinetics  between PFS-U delivery system and PFS-AI product presentations   of sirulumab, at 117th ASCPT Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA.  Healthy subjects (n = 144) were randomized (3:3:3:7:7) to 1 of 5 treatment groups, which includes sirukumab (50 and 100 mg) in two sc injection devices, and 100 mg as an iv infusion. Mean absolute bioavailability of sirukumab was 92.4, and 81.4% when administered by PFS-AI and PFS-U, respectively. Cmax, tmax, AUC (0 to infinity), AUC (0 to 77 days), and t1/2 for sc doses ranges from 4.40 to 34.61 (microg/ml), 5 d, 116.13 to 262.70 microg.day/ml, 110.26 to 228.50 microg.day/ml, 15.87 to 18.72 days, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1743492" linkType="Reference"&gt;1743492&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2012, an open-label, multi-center, drug-drug interaction phase I study (&lt;ulink linkID="89277" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01636557&lt;/ulink&gt;; CR100842; CNTO136ARA1001; 2011-001704-35) began in Germany, South Africa, Maldova and Korea in patients (n = 12) with RA.
