In both phase II and ENGAGE studies, femur T-scores, spine and femur Z-scores were improved over time. In the ENCORE study of patients stabilized after a mean of ten years of enzyme therapy (ERT; n = 157), T- and Z-scores (spine and femur) remained in the reference range for up to four years; the least square mean of spine Z-scores improved by 0.29 (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). In the EDGE study (n = 170, mostly ERT switch) of patients stabilized on eliglustat during a 6- to 18-month lead-in period, T- and Z-scores (spine and femur) were normal and maintained.

In June 2016, further clinical data were presented at the 21st EHA Annual Meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.  Relative to baseline, spleen and liver volumes were decreased and mean lumbar spine bone mineral density was came back to normal range from osteopenic with corresponding reductions in biomarkers after 4 years [&lt;ulink linkID="1771414" linkType="Reference"&gt;1771414&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2017, further data were presented at the 13th ICIEM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After eight years of eliglustat treatment, mean hemoglobin was increased by 2.1 g/dl and platelet count increased by 110%, respectively. Mean spleen was decreased by 68% and liver volumes decreased by 31%. Of 4 long-term therapeutic goals (spleen, liver, hemoglobin, and platelets by 100, 100, 93 and 53% of patients, respectively), &amp;gt;/=3 were met by all patients by eight years.

In February 2018, further clinical data were presented at the 14th Annual Lysosomal Disease Network WORLD Symposium in San Diego, CA. All eight mean SF-36 domain scores (six were below normal at baseline) and mean fatigue severity score were normalized; and the mean total scores for the validated Gaucher disease Severity Scoring System changed from ‘moderate' to ‘mild-to-borderline.' Greater margins of improvements were observed in severely affected patients  [&lt;ulink linkID="2009532" linkType="Reference"&gt;2009532&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, further clinical data were presented at the 23rd EHA Annual Congress in Stockholm, Sweden. In three patients, four adverse events (AEs; osteonecrosis and asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) led to treatment withdrawal; 98% AEs were considered mild or moderate and 95% were unrelated to treatment. A total of 10 patients reported 20 AEs, considered related to treatment. No deaths were reported. The changes in platelets (%), Hb (g/dL), liver volume (%) and spleen volume (%) from baseline were +113, +2.2, -34 and -69, respectively.

In vitro results showed Genz-78132 to be 100- to 5000-fold more potent for substrate inhibition than sugar-based analogs belonging to the deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) family, as measured by inhibition of the expression ganglioside GM1. Genz-78132 was at least 20-fold more potent than AMP-DNJ at inhibiting re-accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in liver tissues in a Fabry mouse model following a single infusion of alpha-galactosidase. In the same model, no difference in the inhibition of the re-accumulation of GL-3 was seen between the untreated controls and NB-DNJ treated animals at a 100-fold greater dose than Genz-78132. Compared with the sugar analogs, Genz-78132 was highly specific for inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase. Genz-78132 was well tolerated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro cell viability was maintained at 100% at high doses whilst sugar analogs led to in vitro cell death at much lower doses.

Gaucher disease is an inherited defect of lysosomal functions caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene leading to accumulation of glucocerebroside, primarily in macrophages. Gaucher disease is characterized by visceromegaly and skeletal complications, including osteoporosis and painful episodes of osteonecrosis. In vitro studies demonstrated that, following exposure to eliglustat tartrate, the abundance of GM1 and GM3 gangliosides in cultured human erythroleukemia cells and murine melanoma cells was decreased. In vivo, eliglustat tartrate administered to Asp409Val/null mice lowered the concentrations of glucocerebroside in the liver, lung and spleen and reduced the number of Gaucher cells in the liver. In a phase Ib clinical trial in healthy volunteers, plasma glucocerebroside concentrations were decreased after dosing with eliglustat tartrate, and in phase II clinical trials in patients with type 1 (non-neuronopathic) Gaucher disease, spleen and liver volumes were diminished. Patients also demonstrated improved bone mineral density, correction of abnormal bone marrow signal with MRI and normalization of glucocerebroside and ganglioside GM3 levels. Eliglustat tartrate is orally active and, with potent effects on the primary identified molecular target for type 1 Gaucher disease and other glycosphingolipidoses, appears likely to fulfill high expectations for clinical efficacy.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Gaucher disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in which diverse mutations in the cognate human gene GBA1 lead to diminished activity of the lysosomal enzyme acid beta-glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase; EC 3.2.1.45) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118193"&gt;1118193&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Gaucher disease is over-represented in people of Ashkenazi Jew heritage, but is pan-ethnic [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1124052"&gt;1124052&lt;/ulink&gt;]; a severe form (often referred to as type 3 Gaucher disease) is most prevalent in Arabic countries, China and other parts of Asia, but also occurs in a small, isolated community in Northern Sweden [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118194"&gt;1118194&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Most patients with Gaucher disease are not Jewish.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;When acid beta-glucocerebrosidase is deficient as a result of mutations in GBA1, undegraded glucocerebroside (glucosylceramide) accumulates principally within macrophages [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118198"&gt;1118198&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118202"&gt;1118202&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These cells, which become engorged with undigested glycolipid as a result of their inability to degrade extracellular macromolecules derived from phagocytosed and effete blood components, take on an abnormal morphology and are termed 'Gaucher cells'. These pathological storage cells are found primarily in organs that are rich in macrophages, such as the spleen, liver, bone marrow and occasionally the lungs. As a result, Gaucher disease is associated with visceromegaly and complex diseases of the bones, including osteoporosis and painful episodes of osteonecrosis. Splenic enlargement, which is often massive (&gt; 3 kg in an adult), is associated with a bleeding tendency, susceptibility to infection and anemia, resulting from sequestration of platelets, leukocytes and red cells, respectively. Additionally, infiltration of the bone marrow by pathological macrophages leads to impaired hematopoiesis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118198"&gt;1118198&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118202"&gt;1118202&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The principal manifestations of Gaucher disease in most patients are restricted to the viscera, skeleton and bone marrow (type 1), but in cases where the activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase is severely impaired in situ, neurological features arise [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118206"&gt;1118206&lt;/ulink&gt;]. While the presence of some mutations, and hence genotyping by molecular analysis of the GBA1 gene, may predict severe neurological disease, facile biochemical assays of acid beta-glucosidase activity employing artificial substrates cannot predict clinical severity. Neurological manifestations may progress either rapidly in the so-called acute neuronopathic form (type 2 Gaucher disease) or may follow a more unpredictable and chronic course in the neurological variant known as type 3 Gaucher disease; those with early-onset neurological manifestations represent approximately 5% of all patients affected in populations of European ancestry: acute neurological forms that occur in infancy are fatal within a few years, those forms with more slowly progressive neurological disease run an uncertain course, and those affected almost invariably have prominent systemic features [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118206"&gt;1118206&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Type 1 Gaucher disease, the most common variant, has an estimated birth frequency of approximately 1 in 60,000, although many individuals harboring mutations in GBA1 are mildly affected and may never come to the attention of medical services [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1124052"&gt;1124052&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118210"&gt;1118210&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;After the enzyme deficiency in Gaucher disease was identified, efforts were made to augment residual enzyme activity, and thus correct the inherited defect of glycosphingolipid metabolism. It took more than two decades of research before macrophage-targeted enzyme therapy was successfully introduced [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118213"&gt;1118213&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The first such therapy was &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="70317"&gt;alglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; (Ceredase), a modified human beta-glucocerebrosidase produced from human placental tissue, developed by the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20518"&gt;NIH&lt;/ulink&gt;, with support from &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="16299"&gt;Genzyme Corp&lt;/ulink&gt; and the National Gaucher Foundation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="467449"&gt;467449&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1068562"&gt;1068562&lt;/ulink&gt;], under orphan drug legislation. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="70317"&gt;Alglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt;, administered by intravenous infusion, reversed the visceral manifestations of Gaucher disease, and improved blood counts and general well-being [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1068562"&gt;1068562&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The subsequent application of genetic engineering ultimately led to the generation of the successor to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="70317"&gt;alglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; (Cerezyme), a recombinant analog of human beta-glucocerebrosidase expressed in CHO cells, developed by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="16299"&gt;Genzyme&lt;/ulink&gt;. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;Imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; is a highly successful drug available in numerous countries for the treatment of adults and children with Gaucher disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="480491"&gt;480491&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118222"&gt;1118222&lt;/ulink&gt;], including the chronic neuronopathic type 3 variant in which it improves life-quality, as well as reducing hematological manifestations and visceral engorgement [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118206"&gt;1118206&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118229"&gt;1118229&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118231"&gt;1118231&lt;/ulink&gt;]. While the hematological and inflammatory manifestations of the condition are reversible, skeletal collapse, necrotic injury with fibrosis, and tissue death are clearly beyond any therapy. Therefore, where possible, it is critical that patients should gain access to treatment as early as possible in the course of their disease.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Until 2009, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt;, an ultra-orphan agent, was administered to more than 5500 patients worldwide with Gaucher disease. Since June 2009, however, there has been a worldwide shortage of the agent caused by a vesivirus contamination at &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="16299"&gt;Genzyme&lt;/ulink&gt;'s production facility [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118270"&gt;1118270&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; remains the standard-of-care for the treatment of Gaucher disease, at least two other similar products, predicated on the macrophage-targeting system but employing distinct cell lines for protein expression, have been developed by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20436"&gt;Shire Human Genetic Therapies Inc&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="47399"&gt;velaglucerase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt;) and &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18767"&gt;Pfizer Inc&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1014359"&gt;Protalix BioTherapeutics Inc&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="55979"&gt;taliglucerase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1110622"&gt;1110622&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118237"&gt;1118237&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="47399"&gt;Velaglucerase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt;, a human recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme replacement therapy produced using gene-activation technology, was launched in the US in February 2010 for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1077827"&gt;1077827&lt;/ulink&gt;] and received marketing approval in Europe in August 2010 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128403"&gt;1128403&lt;/ulink&gt;]. An NDA for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="55979"&gt;taliglucerase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt;, a plant cell culture-derived recombinant form of active human glucocerebrosidase, was accepted for review by the US FDA in July 2010 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1115447"&gt;1115447&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Despite its manifest clinical benefit, enzyme therapy has disadvantages: manufacture is costly to set up and such therapy is inconvenient to administer. Infusions of drug, usually given every 2 to 4 weeks, cause minor pain and may 'medicalize' patients; some patients, especially young children, develop a fear of needles and an aversion to the prescribed treatment. In less developed countries, the administration of an intravenous agent may be regarded as an elaborate procedure, particularly in places where clean needles and appropriate equipment for infusion of the drug under safe circumstances are not readily available. While enzyme therapy provides striking therapeutic effects in Gaucher disease, residual foci of pathological macrophages with scarring and vicinal necro-inflammatory changes persist at sanctuary sites within the viscera and bone marrow, even in patients receiving full doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; for many years [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1077356"&gt;1077356&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Hence, therapeutic penetration of Gaucher tissue within the bone marrow, skeleton and lung may be less than optimal. Furthermore, in the small number of patients with neurological manifestations of Gaucher disease, the inability of proteins to penetrate the blood-brain barrier leaves a therapeutic void and represents a genuine unmet medical need [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="439509"&gt;439509&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In an attempt to avoid these issues, companies have investigated non-biological agents for the treatment of Gaucher disease, with particular emphasis on those that are orally available and that can pass the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Gaucher disease belongs to the class of lysosomal diseases known as glycosphingolipidoses, which result directly or indirectly from the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, many hundreds of which are derived from glucocerebroside. The first step in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis is the formation of glucocerebroside, the primary storage molecule in Gaucher disease, via glucocerebroside synthase (uridine diphosphate [UDP]-glucosylceramide glucosyl transferase) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="480502"&gt;480502&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Glucocerebroside synthase is located on the cytosolic leaflet in the Golgi complex. Inhibition of this enzyme was predicted by Norman Radin to serve as the immediate target of therapy in Gaucher disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118242"&gt;1118242&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128461"&gt;1128461&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128462"&gt;1128462&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The sugar mimetic &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin; launched for the treatment of Gaucher disease in the US and EU [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518279"&gt;518279&lt;/ulink&gt;] and Niemann-Pick disease in the EU [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1076071"&gt;1076071&lt;/ulink&gt;]), inhibits glycosidases, including alpha-glycosidases, that mediate packaging of HIV in infected human cells, but, at micromolar concentrations, it also inhibits glucocerebroside synthase, and hence the biosynthesis of glucocerebroside in cultured cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118272"&gt;1118272&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although it has been suggested that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; serves as a ceramide analog [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="480502"&gt;480502&lt;/ulink&gt;], it is likely that the action of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt;, as with other imino sugars, arises from its monosaccharide structure and that it serves as a simple mimetic of the activated sugar nucleotide substrate moiety. Despite remaining a second-line agent, with a relatively low 'take-up' as an oral agent in Gaucher disease, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; nonetheless addresses the first challenge to enzyme therapy: it has an innovative mode of action as well as a more acceptable route of administration for most patients. However, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; is not licensed for use in children and, in young adults, contraception is advised. The unwanted effects of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; are partly predictable from its mode of action: it causes prominent bloating, diarrhea and flatulence resulting from inhibition of small intestinal disaccharidases, including lactase and sucrase-isomaltase activity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="439514"&gt;439514&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="476900"&gt;476900&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118245"&gt;1118245&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118267"&gt;1118267&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118268"&gt;1118268&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118269"&gt;1118269&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Additionally, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; caused abnormalities in male gametes leading to temporary infertility in certain strains of mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118272"&gt;1118272&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Weight loss has also been noted, but it is unclear whether this is related to the other abdominal and digestive effects; it is notable that this effect of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; is not observed in experimental animals treated with the galactose congener N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118272"&gt;1118272&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Other unwanted effects of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; include tremor and peripheral neuropathy. Despite these drawbacks, at the time of its development and licensing, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; as an orally available small molecule offered the potential to address aspects of Gaucher disease, including neurological manifestations, which remain refractory to protein-based therapies.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Eliglustat tartrate (Genz-112638) is based on improved inhibitors of glucocerebroside synthase, and is currently under development by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="16299"&gt;Genzyme&lt;/ulink&gt;. Unlike &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt;, eliglustat tartrate and its congeners are potent, highly specific inhibitors of glucocerebroside synthase at nanomolar concentrations; the inhibition is non-competitive with respect to the nucleotide sugar substrate [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118242"&gt;1118242&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, as a transition state analog rather than a sugar analog, eliglustat tartrate lacks the capacity to inhibit intestinal disaccharidases at concentrations in the high micromolar range; neither does it inhibit the acid glycosidase beta-glucocerebrosidase, which is itself deficient in Gaucher disease. Eliglustat tartrate and its free base (Genz-99067) have been extensively studied in vitro [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118811"&gt;1118811&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Eliglustat tartrate has been evaluated in phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers and phase II clinical trials [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="532874"&gt;532874&lt;/ulink&gt;], and it is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1005994"&gt;1005994&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Eliglustat tartrate is manufactured via a seven-step process, beginning with the coupling of S-(+)-2-phenyl glycinol with phenyl bromoacetate [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3050968"&gt;US-07196205&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA2947422"&gt;US-06855830&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The resulting (5S)-5-phenylmorpholin-2-one was reacted with two equivalents of 1,4-benzodioxan-6-carboxaldehyde in a chiral-stabilized azomethine ylid cycloaddition reaction [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128485"&gt;1128485&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The lactone of the oxazolo-oxazinone cycloadduct formed was opened via reaction with pyrrolidine followed by hydrolysis of the oxazolidine ring, and the amide group was then reduced to the amine. The octanoic acid amide was formed via reaction of the resulting amine with the N-hydroxysuccinide ester of octanoic acid to form the eliglustat free base. The final step was formation of the tartaric acid salt [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3050968"&gt;US-07196205&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA2947422"&gt;US-06855830&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Eliglustat tartrate is one of a series of ceramide-analog glucocerebroside synthase inhibitors, which began with 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) and related compounds [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128541"&gt;1128541&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These inhibitor structures mimic the transition state.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;PDMP and its homologs have dual activity - they inhibit glucocerebroside synthase and also 1-O-acylceramide synthase, which results in elevation of intracellular ceramide levels and inhibition of cell growth [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128543"&gt;1128543&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The PDMP structure was thus modified and refined to increase potency for glucocerebroside inhibition, while reducing the inhibition of 1-O-acylceramide synthase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128543"&gt;1128543&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a series of refinements, the morpholine group was replaced with pyrrolidine and longer chain fatty acids were used [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118242"&gt;1118242&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Small, electron-donating, hydrophilic groups on the aromatic ring further increased activity and selectivity. Studies demonstrated that the chiral 1R,2R-(D-threo)-stereoisomer was the only active stereoisomer among this class of compounds. D-threo-4'-hydroxy-1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (P4) and D-threo-3'4'-ethylenedioxy-P4 have low nanomolar potency for glucocerebroside synthase inhibition, with minimal effects on ceramide levels in cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118242"&gt;1118242&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Preclinical studies demonstrated D-threo-3'4'-ethylenedioxy-P4 as the more potent compound, with an IC50 value of ~ 0.5 nM in intact K562 cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118242"&gt;1118242&lt;/ulink&gt;]. During subsequent preclinical development, it was found that D-threo-3'4'-ethylenedioxy-P4 had poor pharmacokinetic properties, with slow uptake, extremely long t1/2, poor clearance and resulting in vivo toxicities [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118242"&gt;1118242&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1130366"&gt;1130366&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A series of homologs was synthesized, with the goal of improving the pharmacokinetic profile, but retaining the low nanomolar potency and specificity for glucocerebroside synthase inhibition [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The homolog D-threo-3'4'-ethylenedioxy-1-phenyl-2-octanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol exhibited optimal pharmacokinetic properties and potent, specific inhibition of glucocerebroside synthase. The mean IC50 value, as determined in A375 cell lysates or intact K562 cells, was 24 nM, with a range of 14 to 34 nM, or 6 to 14 ng/ml [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The salt form of this compound, eliglustat tartrate, was selected for further development as an oral drug for Gaucher disease.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vitro&lt;/subtitle&gt;The inhibitory action of eliglustat tartrate on glycosphingolipid synthesis was tested indirectly by assaying GM1 and GM3 gangliosides on the surface of cultured human erythroleukemia (K562) cells and murine melanoma (B16/F10) cells, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Cells were incubated for 72 h with eliglustat tartrate (0.6 to 1000 nM). The reduction in surface levels of GM1 and GM3 was dose-dependent, with mean IC50 values of 24 nM for GM1 and 29 nM for GM3 gangliosides. The specificity of the compound was determined relative to intestinal disaccharidases, glycogen debranching enzyme and neutral as well as acidic beta-glucocerebrosidase in rat tissue homogenates and intact human cells. At concentrations of &gt;/= 2500 microM, no inhibition was detected against intestinal lactase, sucrase and maltase activities, alpha-glucosidases I and II, lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) and glycogen debranching enzyme. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;Miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; is a known inhibitor of alpha-glucosidases I and II in the endoplasmic reticulum and also intestinal lactase, sucrase and maltase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the context of in vitro experiments and estimations of eliglustat tartrate concentrations in plasma, concentrations of 6 to 14 ng/ml (14 to 34 nM) are predicted to be within the therapeutic range for patients with Gaucher disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vivo&lt;/subtitle&gt;Given the potent inhibitory activity of eliglustat tartrate as well as its manifest specificity, particularly in comparison with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt;, preclinical animal studies were undertaken in a genetically engineered murine model of Gaucher disease (Asp409Val/null mice) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These animals exhibit occasional Gaucher cells in the viscera in association with the lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebroside and were studied for efficacy measures at a presymptomatic age (10 weeks) and also at a late adult age (~ 7 months) when the storage cells were evident.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 10-week-old Asp409Val/null mice, eliglustat tartrate was investigated for its effects on the potential accumulation of Gaucher cells and glucocerebroside [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="871388"&gt;871388&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1054490"&gt;1054490&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The drug was administered (75 or 150 mg/kg/day po) for 10 weeks. Concentrations of glucocerebroside were dose-dependently reduced in extracts of liver, lung and spleen tissue; administration at the higher dose resulted in reductions in glucocerebroside levels of 60, 40 and 75% in the liver (p &amp;lt; 0.05), lung (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and spleen, respectively, compared with animals receiving vehicle alone. Histological examination of the livers at the end of the study revealed only the occasional presence of Gaucher cells, with cell numbers significantly reduced compared with 20-week-old mice receiving vehicle alone (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Physiological examination also demonstrated a reduced number of Gaucher cells in the liver of Asp409Val/null mice compared with untreated controls [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 7-month-old symptomatic Asp409Val/null mice receiving eliglustat tartrate (150 mg/kg/day po) for 10 weeks, glucocerebroside levels remained at baseline levels in the lung, liver and spleen for the duration of treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;]. After 10 weeks of treatment, glucocerebroside levels were 60, 50 and 40% lower in the liver, lung and spleen, respectively, than in vehicle-treated mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="871388"&gt;871388&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1054490"&gt;1054490&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Studies were also undertaken to investigate the sequential use of enzyme replacement therapy (&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt;) and eliglustat tartrate in the Asp409Val/null murine model of Gaucher disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118811"&gt;1118811&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1124595"&gt;1124595&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; (10 mg/kg iv) was undertaken in 3-month-old mice, with dosing every 2 or 3 days on two to eight occasions; this induced a marked and progressive decrease in glucocerebroside concentrations in the liver, spleen and lung after two infusions. To determine the relative effects of enzyme therapy and substrate reduction therapy with eliglustat tartrate, two groups of 3-month-old Asp409Val/null mice received either &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; (10 mg/kg iv at two-day intervals) or eliglustat tartrate (150 mg/kg/day po, mixed in chow) and a third group was given these treatments sequentially. When administered after enzyme dosing, eliglustat tartrate significantly decreased the amount of glucocerebroside re-accumulating in the liver and spleen of animals. The extent of cellular infiltration in the liver, as judged by staining for the CD68 macrophage marker, demonstrated similarly reduced numbers of CD68+ Gaucher cells. Asp409Val/null mice receiving both &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; and eliglustat tartrate exhibited a significantly lower accumulation of glucocerebroside compared with animals receiving either agent alone, over the 10-week period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118811"&gt;1118811&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Studies have also been conducted to investigate the effect of eliglustat tartrate on hepatic insulin action in diet-induced obese mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1124596"&gt;1124596&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Obese mice treated with eliglustat tartrate (75 or 125 mg/kg/day po) for 12 weeks demonstrated reduced HbA1c levels and increased glucose tolerance relative to controls. In another group of obese mice treated with eliglustat tartrate (120 mg/kg/day po) for 22 days, liver ceramide concentrations remained unchanged relative to baseline, while concentrations of glucosylceramide and ganglioside GM3 in liver tissue decreased by 20 to 30% [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1124596"&gt;1124596&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These results suggest a potential role for eliglustat in the treatment of obesity or type 2 diabetes.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;In vitro testing using eliglustat tartrate in K562 and B16/F10 cells demonstrated no overt cytotoxicity, even at the highest concentration tested (1000 nM) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 7-month-old symptomatic Asp409Val/null mice, eliglustat tartrate (150 mg/kg/day po) for 10 weeks resulted in no observable effects on the well-being or feeding habits of the mice, and they continued to gain weight normally during development [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Unlike comparable studies in mice treated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="480498"&gt;480498&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118262"&gt;1118262&lt;/ulink&gt;], preclinical studies conducted in rats with eliglustat tartrate did not demonstrate significant inhibition of the neutral glucocerebrosidase encoded by the GBA2 gene, and no effect on spermatogenesis or sperm morphology and function was identified [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128496"&gt;1128496&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Toxicology studies in mature cynomolgus monkeys confirmed a lack of effect on spermatogenesis in primates [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1131860"&gt;1131860&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Toxicology studies were conducted in healthy laboratory rats (28-day and 26-week experiments) and tolerance studies were conducted in healthy dogs (28-day and 13- and 52-week experiments) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128496"&gt;1128496&lt;/ulink&gt;]. With the exception of delayed gastrointestinal motility observed at the highest dose only, no unwanted effects or toxicity were observed following single doses up to 100 mg/kg of eliglustat tartrate in rats, including effects on behavior, physiological function (as assessed by the Irwin observation test) rate of respiration and renal function [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128496"&gt;1128496&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism and pharmacokinetics&lt;/subtitle&gt;In studies in human liver microsome preparations, eliglustat free base was actively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system; primary degradation was catalyzed by the CYP2D6 isozyme and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128496"&gt;1128496&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The biodistribution of eliglustat tartrate was examined in healthy rats [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128496"&gt;1128496&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Eliglustat tartrate was not found in brain tissue indicating that the drug either did not penetrate the blood-brain barrier or was a substrate for multidrug efflux transporters of the ATP-binding cassette and/or the P-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug-resistance associated protein family, which limit movement of molecules into the brain and enhance their efflux from the brain. In an in vitro study with MDR-transfected MDCK cells, eliglustat tartrate demonstrated a very high efflux ratio. Additional studies with radiolabelled eliglustat tartrate in Pgp-deficient mice (Crl:CF-1 mdr1aPgp) showed a 10-fold increase in radioactivity in brain versus normal (CF-1) mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1131860"&gt;1131860&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Thus, it was concluded that the drug was transported out of the brain, thus suggesting that eliglustat tartrate would not have a therapeutic role for glycosphingolipidoses associated with neurodegenerative features [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128496"&gt;1128496&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Single- and multiple-dose administration of eliglustat tartrate was examined in three phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers (n = 159), to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the drug, and also the effect of ingested food. Eliglustat tartrate was administered as escalating single doses (&amp;lt;/= 30 mg/kg po; n = 99), escalating multiple doses (&amp;lt;/= 350 mg po, bid; n = 36) or in conjunction with food (300 mg po; n = 24) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In most volunteers, a twice-daily dose of 50 mg induced plasma concentrations of eliglustat tartrate that were within the predicted therapeutic range of ~ 10 ng/ml, as determined by the IC50 value of eliglustat tartrate for glucocerebroside synthase in K562 cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="871388"&gt;871388&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This trial demonstrated that plasma concentrations of eliglustat tartrate could be attained within the predicted therapeutic range (6 to 14 ng/ml) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The pharmacokinetics of escalating single doses of eliglustat tartrate demonstrated a linear, but non-proportional, response [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Maximum plasma concentrations were recorded ~ 2 h after oral ingestion; plasma concentrations demonstrated a monophasic terminal decay with a t1/2 value of ~ 6 h. Following multiple dosing, non-linear absorption led to plasma concentrations that were higher than predicted. After twice-daily dosing, steady-state concentrations of the drug were achieved ~ 60 h after administration. Examination of urine collected over 8 h following administration of eliglustat tartrate demonstrated that &amp;lt; 1.5% of the drug was excreted in the unchanged form. Ingestion of food had no significant effect on either the rate or extent of absorption [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;As preclinical studies with liver microsomes had demonstrated that the predominant metabolism of eliglustat free base was by the CYP2D6 isozyme [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128496"&gt;1128496&lt;/ulink&gt;], participants in the phase I clinical trial receiving multiple doses of eliglustat tartrate were genotyped for CYP2D6 metabolizer status. As predicted, a rank-order relationship between the metabolism of CYP2D6 substrates and plasma concentrations of eliglustat free base was identified. While the principal route for metabolism involves CYP2D6 in humans, the CYP3A4 isozyme also contributes a minor pathway. Metabolism generated nine metabolites of eliglustat; these were either minimally active or completely inactive with respect to glucocerebroside synthase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="6910"&gt;NCT00358150&lt;/ulink&gt;; GZGD00304) in patients (n = 26) with Gaucher disease, treatment with eliglustat tartrate (50 mg po, bid) resulted in a mean Tmax of 2.3 +/- 0.9 h and a mean t1/2 of 6.8 +/- 4.7 h [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1095727"&gt;1095727&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In a phase Ib clinical trial in healthy volunteers, plasma glucocerebroside levels were reduced after 4 to 10 days of dosing with eliglustat tartrate (50, 200 and 350 mg po, bid) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="871388"&gt;871388&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1054490"&gt;1054490&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;At the time of publication, a phase II, multicenter, open-label, single-assignment clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="6910"&gt;NCT00358150&lt;/ulink&gt;; GZGD00304) to explore the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of eliglustat tartrate in patients (n = 26) with type 1 Gaucher disease was ongoing. Data from the first [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1095727"&gt;1095727&lt;/ulink&gt;] and second [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1125834"&gt;1125834&lt;/ulink&gt;] years of this trial have been reported.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Men and women with enzymatically documented type 1 Gaucher disease were eligible for the clinical trial. Entry required a spleen enlarged by at least 10-fold compared with a healthy spleen, together with one or more of the following hematological indices: platelet count between 45 and 100 x 10(3)/mm3 and/or hemoglobin concentration between 8.0 and 10.0 g/dl for women or 8.0 and 11.0 g/dl for men. Patients were excluded if they had undergone a splenectomy, experienced new bone crises or skeletal disease identified during the previous year, experienced anemia resulting from causes other than Gaucher disease, had structural or functional cardiac abnormalities, or if they had serious Gaucher manifestations, including liver infarcts, bleeding varices and neurological and lung complications. Patients who had received prior treatment with either &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; during the previous year or bisphosphonate drugs during the previous 3 months were also excluded. Patients who enrolled in the trial were required to avoid consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice, which may interfere with the metabolism of eliglustat and the action of the Pgp transporter [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1095727"&gt;1095727&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Patients initially received a single dose of eliglustat tartrate (50 mg po) with blood sampling over the following 24 h; the next day, eliglustat tartrate dosing (50 mg po, bid) was initiated. On day 10, samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, including predose plasma concentrations. From day 20, the dose was adjusted (100 mg po, bid) for patients whose trough concentrations were &amp;lt; 5 ng/ml. Patients completing 52 weeks on the trial were allowed to enter a trial extension [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1095727"&gt;1095727&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A composite primary efficacy endpoint was based on achieving two of three parameters: &gt;/= 15% reduction in spleen volume (as determined by MRI or spiral CT imaging), &gt;/= 0.5 g/dl increase in hemoglobin concentration and &gt;/= 15% increase in platelet count, relative to baseline. Secondary endpoints included change in liver volume relative to baseline, levels of plasma markers of Gaucher disease activity (including chitotriosidase and pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine C-C motif ligand 18 [CCL18], ACE and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase [TRAP]) and levels of exploratory biomarkers, including plasma glucocerebroside and ganglioside GM3. Skeletal changes were evaluated by conventional radiology, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and T1-weighted MRI of femurs. Safety monitoring included physical examination, routine clinical laboratory tests and neurological examinations, and also detailed studies of potential cardiac events via ECG with Holter and telemetry monitoring, as well as Doppler echocardiography. Other safety evaluations included nerve conduction velocity and neuropsychological testing. Of the 26 patients enrolled in the trial, 10 were male and 16 were female; 7 patients were Jewish [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1095727"&gt;1095727&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;After 26 weeks in the clinical trial, preliminary results from eight patients demonstrated that plasma glucocerebroside levels had normalized, with a mean increase in hemoglobin levels of 1.3 +/- 0.5 g/dl, a mean decrease in spleen and liver volume of 29.8 +/- 7.9 and 10.1 +/- 6.3%, respectively, and a mean increase in platelet levels of 42.7 +/- 20.7%, relative to baseline [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1054493"&gt;1054493&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Of the 22 patients who completed 1 year of the trial, 20 attained the composite primary endpoint for efficacy, with improvements in at least two of the three abnormal values present at baseline. Two patients failed to attain composite endpoints because of decreased platelet count; both had met the endpoint for decrease in spleen volume. At 1 year, the mean hemoglobin concentration for those patients completing the trial had increased significantly by 1.62 +/- 1.28 g/dl (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and the mean platelet count had increased by 40.3 +/- 37.5% (p &amp;lt; 0.001), relative to baseline. At 1 year, spleen and liver volumes had decreased significantly, by 38.5 +/- 11.4 and 17 +/- 10.5 %, respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.001), relative to baseline [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="987252"&gt;987252&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1027480"&gt;1027480&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1037636"&gt;1037636&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1054491"&gt;1054491&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1095727"&gt;1095727&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;No bone crises occurred and there were no changes in mobility or bone pain. There were early signs of improvement in Gaucher cell infiltration of the bone marrow in the femurs ('dark marrow') in 35% of patients. There was a 35 to 50% decrease in chitotriosidase, CCL18, ACE and TRAP relative to baseline, and plasma levels of glucocerebroside and ganglioside GM3 normalized. One patient experienced progression of asymptomatic osteonecrosis, which was noted in retrospect to be present at baseline. There were significant and salutary improvements in quality-of-life scores for physical functioning and general health, and a trend toward improvement of the medium Fatigue Severity Scale Score [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1037636"&gt;1037636&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1095727"&gt;1095727&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;After 18 months, data from 22 patients indicated a mean increase in hemoglobin levels of 1.6 +/- 1.3 g/dl, a mean decrease in spleen and liver volume of 39 +/- 11 and 17 +/- 10%, respectively, and a mean increase in platelet levels of 40 +/- 37%, relative to baseline. Chitotriosidase and CCL18 levels decreased by 52 and 55%, respectively, relative to baseline. Plasma glucocerebroside levels normalized in all patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1058582"&gt;1058582&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1099023"&gt;1099023&lt;/ulink&gt;]. An improvement of Gaucher cell infiltration of the bone marrow was demonstrated in seven (32%) patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1058582"&gt;1058582&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1099023"&gt;1099023&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1124948"&gt;1124948&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Data at 2 years demonstrated continued improvement across all endpoints compared with baseline [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118755"&gt;1118755&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1125834"&gt;1125834&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Of the original 26 patients, 20 completed 2 years of treatment and the majority were continuing in an extended trial beyond 2 years. Spleen and liver volumes had decreased by a mean of 52.4 +/- 10.7 and 23.9 +/- 12.8%, respectively. Organ volume reductions were greatest in patients with severe baseline organomegaly. Average hemoglobin concentration had increased by 2.1 +/- 1.5 g/dl overall and 3.1 g/dl in 10 patients with baseline anemia, with a a continuing increase in platelet counts (81.5 +/- 56.0% from baseline) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118755"&gt;1118755&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1125834"&gt;1125834&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Biomarkers continued to decrease significantly with chitotriosidase and CCL18 activities each at a median value of 75% at 2 years, relative to baseline [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1125834"&gt;1125834&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Continued analysis of the skeletal manifestations in Gaucher disease, including bone mineral density as determined by DXA, demonstrated salutary changes with significant improvements of Z-score in the lumbar spine of +0.6 in 16 patients determined at 1 and 2 years [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118755"&gt;1118755&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1125834"&gt;1125834&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Of 18 patients with abnormal dark marrow signal identified independently by MRI at baseline, 6 had improved after 1 year and an additional 2 patients had demonstrated improvement after 2 years on the trial; the abnormal marrow signal in 10 other patients had remained stable [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118755"&gt;1118755&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1125834"&gt;1125834&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These effects are striking and indicate clinical efficacy comparable with that reported for patients receiving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; over a 48-month period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118832"&gt;1118832&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Blood biomarker evaluations demonstrated improvements, particularly in CCL18 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118839"&gt;1118839&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Plasma glucocerebroside and the ganglioside GM3, which is derived from it, were elevated at baseline. Soon after the administration of the drug in the trial patients, plasma concentrations of these glycosphingolipids declined to within the normal range. Further analysis demonstrated strong correlations between the trough plasma concentrations of the drug and reductions in spleen volume and chitotriosidase: adjustment of the dose might augment treatment responses in those who metabolize the drug rapidly and in whom its concentration in the plasma reduces to &amp;lt; 5 ng/ml [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118839"&gt;1118839&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;After 1 year, all 20 of the eligible patients from the phase II clinical trial chose to continue in the extension period and subsequently into the third year of the trial.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="16299"&gt;Genzyme&lt;/ulink&gt; has initiated three multicenter phase III clinical trials of eliglustat tartrate. The first of these trials (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="59003"&gt;NCT00943111&lt;/ulink&gt;; ENCORE; GZGD02607) was a randomized, open-label, parallel-assignment trial in adults (expected n = 186) with type 1 Gaucher disease, designed to compare the safety and efficacy of eliglustat tartrate (50, 100 or 150 mg po, bid) with that of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; (varied doses, iv). A requirement of this trial was to enroll patients who had received &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; for at least 3 years and who had achieved clinical stability by reaching key therapeutic goals. At the time of publication, international recruitment in the trial had been initiated, despite difficulties arising from the worldwide shortage of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118270"&gt;1118270&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The primary endpoint of this trial was the percentage of patients with stable disease after 52 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included total T- and Z-scores for bone mineral density, change in spleen volume, hemoglobin levels, liver volume and platelet counts relative to baseline after 52 weeks of treatment.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A second phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="53675"&gt;NCT00891202&lt;/ulink&gt;; ENGAGE; GZGD02507) was to evaluate eliglustat tartrate (50 or 100 mg po) in patients (expected n = 36) with a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 Gaucher disease. The primary endpoint of this trial was reduction in spleen volume relative to baseline after 39 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included change in hemoglobin levels, liver volume and platelet counts relative to baseline. At the time of publication, patients were being recruited to this trial.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A third phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-assignment, dose-comparison clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="64496"&gt;NCT01074944&lt;/ulink&gt;; EDGE; GZGD03109) has been initiated to compare the effects of once- or twice-daily dosing of eliglustat tartrate (50, 100 or 150 mg po) in patients (expected n = 234) with type 1 Gaucher disease. The trial is planned to run for 12 months, with the primary endpoint being the number of randomized patients who remain stable after treatment for both dosing regimens. Secondary endpoints were hemoglobin levels, platelet count, spleen and liver volume, biomarker levels, and assessments of bone disease and Gaucher symptoms. At the time of publication, patients were being recruited to this trial.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side effects and contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;In the phase Ia clinical trial, no serious adverse occurrences were noted, but mild to moderate gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea, dizziness and vomiting, were more frequent with escalating single and multiple doses of eliglustat tartrate [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Electrocardiography with continuous telemetry was employed to monitor the cardiac electrophysiology in the phase Ia and Ib clinical trials [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the multiple-dose arm of the trial, no cardiac effects were evident at any of the three administered doses. In the single-dose trial, however, slight prolongation of PR, QRS and QT/QTc intervals occurred at the time of the maximum plasma concentrations in some volunteers receiving high doses (10 to 30 mg/kg). Estimated plasma concentrations were ~ 240 ng/ml in these participants, which was approximately 20-fold greater than the predicted therapeutic concentration of 6 to 14 ng/ml [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over clinical trial (ICH-EC14) was undertaken to assess the potential of eliglustat tartrate to affect cardiac repolarization in healthy volunteers (n = 99) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Neither a therapeutic (200 mg) nor supratherapeutic (800 mg) dose of eliglustat tartrate had any significant effect on cardiac repolarization.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the phase II clinical trial, serious adverse events were reported in three patients, including three radiation exposures in two unexpectedly pregnant patients and one spontaneous abortion, all of which were considered unrelated to the treatment (trial participants were required to use secure contraception) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1095727"&gt;1095727&lt;/ulink&gt;]. There were also two patients with asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), one of which was considered serious because the patient (a 60-year-old male) had to be hospitalized for detailed cardiac telemetry: this was considered possibly related to the treatment, occurring after the first dose. The second instance of NSVT occurred in a 56-year-old female and was assessed as mild and unrelated to treatment. In these two patients, these events were detected at 6 and 12 h, respectively, after the first dose on day 1, but the drug was not detectable in the plasma in either patient at the time. Detailed independent cardiological review suggested that the tachycardias were unrelated to treatment; pre-existing cardiac valve abnormalities were identified in both patients. The second patient underwent a Holter study 1 month after discontinuing the trial and NSVT again was observed, indicating a lack of relationship to the trial drug. A detailed analysis of all patients in the phase II clinical trial for QTcF interval demonstrated no effects, although minor changes were observed in the PR and QRS intervals. The most commonly reported adverse event was viral infection (n = 6). Other adverse events included abdominal pain (n = 2), diarrhea (n = 2), palpitations (n = 1) and headache (n = 1) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1095727"&gt;1095727&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Patent summary&lt;/subtitle&gt;A family of compounds encompassing eliglustat free base appears to be first claimed in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA2951737"&gt;US-06916802&lt;/ulink&gt; (amino ceramide-like compounds having a C(7) to C(9) alkanoyl moiety; expiry April 2022).

Again, the use of eliglustat free base is disclosed generically and the nonanoyl derivative is preferred. At the time of publication, no corresponding national or regional filings had been published.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Gaucher disease, an extremely rare inborn error of metabolism, is a chronic multisystem disorder. Enzyme replacement therapy has hitherto provided the best standard-of-care, and induces remission of the principal visceral manifestations of the condition, with improved hematological parameters and diminished risk of bleeding and infection, as well as enhanced quality of life and well being. With timely diagnosis and treatment, enzyme therapy restores normal growth and maturation in affected infants and children, and reduces the frequency of episodes of osteonecrosis. In adults, treatment results in less frequent osteonecrosis and improvements in bone mineral density, thus reducing fracture risk; however, enzyme therapy does not affect established disease in the skeleton and visceral involvement with fibrotic scarring [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118876"&gt;1118876&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118879"&gt;1118879&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118198"&gt;1118198&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1124052"&gt;1124052&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128497"&gt;1128497&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128578"&gt;1128578&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Currently, Gaucher disease requires lifelong enzyme therapy, but there is no doubt that the requirement for intravenous infusions is cumbersome and intrusive for many patients. In some parts of the world, intravenous infusions pose difficulties where public healthcare provision and hospital services are tenuous.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In vivo studies indicate that in a transgenic murine model with glucocerebrosidase deficiency and some features of human Gaucher disease, eliglustat tartrate is an active and specific inhibitor of glucocerebroside synthase with a salutary action on the associated metabolic abnormalities, storage material and histological effects [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="827240"&gt;827240&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118811"&gt;1118811&lt;/ulink&gt;], thus providing a basis for clinical trials.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The emerging clinical development program for eliglustat tartrate indicates that it is a potent agent with clinical effects in Gaucher disease, which are comparable with those induced by targeted enzyme therapy. So far, eliglustat tartrate appears to have an acceptable safety profile with few adverse events. Administration as a twice-daily oral therapy represents a significant advantage over intravenous infusions and will be attractive for many patients, particularly young individuals. Given the inability of eliglustat tartrate to effectively enter brain tissue, however, the compound is unlikely to offer benefit to patients with neurological features of Gaucher disease, particularly neurological manifestations classified as type 3 Gaucher disease, for which, at present, no treatment is available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The safety profile of eliglustat tartrate appears to be superior to that of the only oral agent currently licensed for Gaucher disease, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; (an iminosugar that is not metabolized, but which is associated with a high frequency of gastrointestinal effects/peripheral neuropathy, tremor and other unwanted effects). As a ceramide analog and potent inhibitor of glucocerebroside synthase, eliglustat tartrate offers numerous advantages. Emerging data demonstrating that eliglustat tartrate has beneficial effects on the abnormal bone marrow signal, widely believed to signify ongoing risks of osteonecrosis, are striking. At the same time, the marked improvements in bone mineral density in patients receiving eliglustat tartrate for up to 24 months in the phase II clinical trial are also noteworthy. Given the safety profile and efficacy of eliglustat tartrate in patients with moderate type 1 Gaucher disease and the salutary effect on bone mineral density and abnormal bone marrow signals in patients, the criteria for a clinical proof-of-concept was met in the phase II clinical trial. With these data in hand, there is every reason to expect that eliglustat tartrate will received a license for adults with Gaucher disease and will supersede &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; and, possibly for many patients, enzyme therapy.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Nevertheless, type 1 Gaucher disease requires chronic treatment, and while eliglustat tartrate may well represent a valuable alternative to the best available treatment with enzymatic augmentation, it should be remembered that certain long-term safety criteria must be met before it can be generally accepted. The drug, unlike the iminosugars, is subject to complex metabolism via the CYP system. Not only would co-existent medication lead to metabolic interactions that could alter its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, but also it is uncertain what effect the numerous metabolites generated by the CYP system may have, although those so far identified have little or no activity on the synthesis of glycosphingolipids or on CYP enzymes [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128496"&gt;1128496&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Careful monitoring would be prudent in patients taking eliglustat tartrate in conjunction with other agents known to interact with the CYP2D6 system; such drugs include &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8956"&gt;paroxetine&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44299"&gt;ketoconazole&lt;/ulink&gt; and rifampicin [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118817"&gt;1118817&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;While eliglustat tartrate appears likely to be highly acceptable for patients as an oral agent for Gaucher disease, it is important to note that, as with the statins, administration in women of childbearing age poses particular difficulties for long-term use. Although possible unwanted effects in the cardiovascular system, particularly in relation to intracardiac conduction abnormalities, have been intensely scrutinized, any oral agent subject to complex metabolism may have unwanted effects that are only observed after prolonged administration in the disease population and which cannot be predicted; moreover, from a theoretical viewpoint, it should be recognized that the long-term effects of modulating glycosphingolipid biosynthesis with a potent inhibitory molecule in humans are unknown. However, at the time of publication, with the exception of potential cardiac effects, no other safety concerns have become apparent in more than 4 years of exposure in humans. As with enzyme replacement therapy, determining whether eliglustat tartrate has salutary effects on the existing risks of B-cell malignancies, parkinsonism and other rare manifestations of Gaucher disease, including pulmonary hypertension, will require ongoing study.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In summary, eliglustat tartrate is an innovative agent based on the established principle of substrate inhibition for the treatment of inherited metabolic diseases. It is salutary to note that most authorities consider &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt;, the first agent to offer a safe and definitive treatment for Gaucher disease, to be the preferred, first-line option [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="439514"&gt;439514&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118854"&gt;1118854&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118876"&gt;1118876&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Only long-term follow-up will enable the appropriate conclusions to be drawn about the applicability of eliglustat tartrate to the general Gaucher population. Gaucher disease requires expert monitoring, and with the requirement to ensure that serum concentrations of eliglustat are held within the therapeutic range, the need for the drug to be provided by experienced doctors in specialist centers is ever more apparent. Treating patients with Gaucher disease mandates a continuing health contract between the patient, the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industrial complex and appropriate, often academic, healthcare partners.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="16299"&gt;Genzyme&lt;/ulink&gt;, currently facing difficulties in its monopoly position in the supply of targeted enzyme replacement therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118270"&gt;1118270&lt;/ulink&gt;], has understandably committed substantial resources to the clinical development of eliglustat tartrate. With the comprehensive array of phase III clinical trials now underway in Gaucher disease, the therapeutic position of eliglustat tartrate will soon be defined. As matters stand, eliglustat tartrate holds much promise as an effective and convenient therapy in the principal marketplace for &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="16299"&gt;Genzyme&lt;/ulink&gt; and its competitors in the field of rare genetic diseases. This market manifestly enabled &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="16299"&gt;Genzyme&lt;/ulink&gt; to attain almost iconic status, as the revenue from its international business approaches 'blockbuster' values for several, highly successful ultra-orphan drugs, much of which is predicated on the market principles created during the development of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;alglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7456"&gt;imiglucerase&lt;/ulink&gt;. While the market ultimately depended on the efficacy of the biological agents for Gaucher disease, by the same token, it should provide a productive platform for development of eliglustat tartrate, as well as for pharmaceutical application in related glycosphingolipidoses, such as Fabry disease. Because neither enzyme therapy nor &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3791"&gt;miglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; affect the neurological manifestations of neuronopathic Gaucher disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="977506"&gt;977506&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118879"&gt;1118879&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1118891"&gt;1118891&lt;/ulink&gt;], continued research into the development of inhibitors of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis that penetrate the blood-brain barrier and are not substrates for the multidrug resistance transporter, will be of strategic importance in the field. In this context, research into the activity and properties of congeners of eliglustat tartrate offers genuine hope for the pressing clinical needs of patients with neurodegenerative diseases caused by disturbances in glycosphingolipid metabolism.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="16299">Sanofi Genzyme</Company><Country
