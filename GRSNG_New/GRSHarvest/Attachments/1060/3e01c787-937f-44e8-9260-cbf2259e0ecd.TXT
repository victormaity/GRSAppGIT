SMART anti-IFN-gamma humanized monoclonal antibody, for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases. In March 2004, PDL reported that fontolizumab had failed to meet the primary endpoint in two phase II CD trials [&lt;ulink linkID="528130" linkType="reference"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By January 2006, a pilot phase II RA trial was underway [&lt;ulink linkID="645250" linkType="Reference"&gt;645250&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2003, PDL anticipated initiating a phase I trial of fontolizumab for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by the end of the second quarter of 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="488784" linkType="reference"&gt;488784&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in August 2006, PDL and Biogen Idec stated that they had agreed to discontinue the evaluation of HuZAF in RA, and the companies had no plans for development in other indications at this time [&lt;ulink linkID="1026378" linkType="Reference"&gt;1026378&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;PDL was previously developing fontolizumab as a potential treatment for psoriasis. By late 2001, it had entered phase I trials for this indication [&lt;ulink linkID="443330" linkType="reference"&gt;443330&lt;/ulink&gt;], however, in November 2003, due to the lack of activity observed in the trial, PDL announced that it would not pursue fontolizumab for a registration in psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkID="511332" linkType="reference"&gt;511332&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;CROHN'S DISEASE&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2004, PDL presented phase II data at the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, in Monterey, CA, showing that fontolizumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in both the HARMONY I and HARMONY II studies. In HARMONY II, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 133 evaluable CD patients, fontolizumab demonstrated no benefit over placebo, although the antibody was well tolerated. A total of 91 patients received a second iv dose of fontolizumab (4 or 10 mg/kg) or placebo at day 28. In this group, significant improvements over placebo were observed. In the 196-patient HARMONY I study, fontolizumab was administered at 1 or 4 mg/kg iv, followed by additional sc doses. At day 28 following a single infusion, there were no differences in response between fontolizumab groups and the placebo group. At the 1 mg/kg dose, 39% of patients achieved a clinical response, and at 4 mg/kg  33% of patients responded. In the placebo group 38% of patients responded. At that time, additional analysis of the HARMONY I data was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="528130" linkType="reference"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were presented at the 12th Annual European Gastroenterology Week meeting in Prague, Czech Republic [&lt;ulink linkID="566219" linkType="Reference"&gt;566219&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;As of February 2003, PDL planned to initiate a second phase II trial, investigating higher doses of fontolizumab, later that year [&lt;ulink linkID="488452" linkType="reference"&gt;488452&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The phase II trial, to be conducted in Europe at up to 25 sites, was to evaluate an initial iv 4 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg dose followed by additional lower sc doses [&lt;ulink linkID="488784" linkType="reference"&gt;488784&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="488991" linkType="reference"&gt;488991&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2003, the phase II trial in 120 patients was started [&lt;ulink linkID="490211" linkType="reference"&gt;490211&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2003, PDL expected to report results from both phase II CD trials in the first quarter of 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="499493" linkType="reference"&gt;499493&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2003, at the 11th Ulcer Research Conference in Dubovnik, Croatia, it was reported that 28 patients had shown anti-inflammatory effects in this trial [&lt;ulink linkID="507952" linkType="reference"&gt;507952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2003, at the inaugural Antibody Therapeutics conference in San Diego, CA, it was reported that 130 patients were enrolled and results were expected by mid-2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="517357" linkType="reference"&gt;517357&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2002, PDL initiated a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to be conducted at up to 25 sites in North America and Europe. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the antibody for induction of a clinical response, defined as a decrease of at least 100 points in the patient's CD activity index (CDAI) score at day 29 of the study. Up to 175 patients were to be randomized into one of four treatment groups or placebo and to receive an initial iv loading dose of 1 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg or placebo. Beginning on study day 29, patients who received active drug would be randomized to receive one sc dose of 0.1 or 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks for a total of three additional doses, and patients who received placebo would continue to receive placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="450688" linkType="reference"&gt;450688&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Enrollment of the trial was complete by November 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="511332" linkType="reference"&gt;511332&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase I/II double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial planning to  involve up to 56 CD patients began in January 2001. The trial was designed as a two-stage study; patients receiving the active drug and having a clinically meaningful response in stage A were to enter stage B where they would receive three additional doses of drug or placebo at 4-week intervals. Endpoints to be analyzed included safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, antibody responses and changes in disease state [&lt;ulink linkID="395717" linkType="reference"&gt;395717&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2001, PDL reported preliminary results from this study   at which time 29 CD patients had been entered and evaluated in stage A. [&lt;ulink linkID="428018" linkType="reference"&gt;428018&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2002, further preliminary results from 45 CD patients who participated in this trial were presented at the Digestive Disease Week meeting in San Francisco, CA. Single doses of either 0.1, 1 or 4 mg/kg, or placebo, were administered by iv infusion over 60 min; response rates were 0, 25 and 50% for fontolizumab groups, respectively, and 40% for placebo. Adverse events were mild or moderate, with an influenza-like syndrome being the only drug-related event. Of the 45 patients evaluated, 18 subsequently received 3 doses of 0.05, 0.5 or 2 mg/kg fontolizumab or placebo by 60-min iv infusion every 4 weeks. Of the treated patients, 85% responded; however, so did 75% of the placebo-treated patients, though this might have been a result of the single dose of fontolizumab that they received in the first stage of the study [&lt;ulink linkID="452003" linkType="reference"&gt;452003&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="452048" linkType="reference"&gt;452048&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="451111" linkType="reference"&gt;451111&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data from this trial were presented at the DDW meeting in New Orleans, LA, in May 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="538242" linkType="reference"&gt;538242&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;PSORIASIS&lt;/subtitle&gt;In January 2001, PDL announced its intention to initiate a phase I double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to obtain safety, pharmacokinetic and preliminary efficacy data in up to 35 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Fontolizumab would be administered as single escalating doses [&lt;ulink linkID="395717" linkType="reference"&gt;395717&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="413349" linkType="reference"&gt;413349&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A phase I pilot study in psoriasis patients was underway by late 2001 [&lt;ulink linkID="443330" linkType="reference"&gt;443330&lt;/ulink&gt;] and was ongoing as of January 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="475617" linkType="reference"&gt;475617&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2003, data from the trials were presented at the SRI Seventh International Inflammation in Drug Discovery and Development Meeting, in San Diego, CA. A total of 20 patients with plaque psoriasis were given fontolizumab 0.1, 1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg iv. At the 10 mg/kg dose three out of four patients showed histological improvement of their lesions. The drug was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile [&lt;ulink linkID="482596" linkType="reference"&gt;482596&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2003, PDL confirmed that no evidence of activity was observed in the study. At this time, the company announced that it did not plan to pursue fontolizumab for a registration in psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkID="511332" linkType="reference"&gt;511332&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;OTHER PHASE I DATA&lt;/subtitle&gt;Results from a phase I escalating-dose study, examining the safety of the antibody in 22 healthy volunteers, were presented at the 64th annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology, Philadelphia 2000. Volunteers received single iv doses ranging from 0.01 m/kg to 4 mg/kg: the antibody was safely administered to the subjects with no serious or severe adverse events reported at the doses tested [&lt;ulink linkID="387632" linkType="reference"&gt;387632&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The ability of fontolizumab to block a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction was also determined: the data suggest that the antibody is active at low doses and could play a role in the treatment of autoimmune conditions in which IFN-gamma may be important, such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis [&lt;ulink linkID="387632" linkType="reference"&gt;387632&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><AdditionalInformation><displayLabel>Additional Information</displayLabel><value>&lt;AdditionalInformation&gt;&lt;para&gt;As of February 2003, PDL was actively seeking to outlicense the development and commercialization rights to fontolizumab outside of the US and Canada [&lt;ulink linkID="488452" linkType="reference"&gt;488452&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in August 2005, &lt;ulink linkID="1005244" linkType="Company"&gt;Biogen Idec&lt;/ulink&gt; agreed to jointly develop and commercialize fontolizumab in the US and Europe. Outside those territories, Biogen Idec would fund all development and commercialization and pay a royalty to PDL. The deal was subject to antitrust review and approval [&lt;ulink linkID="615683" linkType="Reference"&gt;615683&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The deal with Biogen Idec was closed in September 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="622633" linkType="Reference"&gt;622633&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;PDL's SMART antibodies combine the binding site of a mouse monoclonal antibody with 90% of a human antibody. The human antibodies were obtained from human donors and the production was made genetically stable via a patented 'trioma' technology [&lt;ulink linkID="184800" linkType="reference"&gt;184800&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 1996, Protein Design Labs was issued with patent &lt;ulink linkID="IN2687201" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-05585089&lt;/ulink&gt; which covers the SMART humanized monoclonal antibodies [&lt;ulink linkID="228824" linkType="reference"&gt;228824&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/AdditionalInformation&gt;</value></AdditionalInformation></DevelopmentProfile><ExpertReview>&lt;para&gt;Francis J Dumont, 421 Dogwood Avenue, Egg Harbor Township, NJ 08234, USA&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Submission date: 27 February 2005&lt;br/&gt;Publication date: 5 April 2005&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Cytokines play critical roles in the regulation of immune responses. Alterations in the production or activity of cytokines may therefore lead to immune dysfunction, including chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587647"&gt;587647&lt;/ulink&gt;]. One cytokine whose excessive release appears to be associated with a number of pathological processes related to chronic immune activation is interferon (IFN)gamma, which is predominantly secreted by natural killer (NK) cells and by subsets of activated T-lymphocytes, especially T-helper type 1 (Th1) cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587648"&gt;587648&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;IFNgamma exerts diverse and complex effects on immune and non-immune cells and often acts in synergy with other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta and TNFalpha [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587648"&gt;587648&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The unique characteristic of its action lies in its ability to upregulate the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on macrophages and other cells, which enhances antigen presentation to T-cells. In addition, IFNgamma promotes cellular immunity through the activation of macrophages, NK cells and effector T-cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587648"&gt;587648&lt;/ulink&gt;]. High-level production of IFNgamma is considered to be a hallmark of Th1-type immunity, which is characterized by activation of the antimicrobial activity of macrophages and by inflammatory reactions with a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) character [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587651"&gt;587651&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587654"&gt;587654&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587655"&gt;587655&lt;/ulink&gt;]. IFNgamma itself is one of the factors that promote the differentiation of Th1 cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587661"&gt;587661&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587662"&gt;587662&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587663"&gt;587663&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Since the pathophysiology of several autoimmune disorders is thought to be driven by Th1 type inflammation, inhibiting the action of IFNgamma has been envisaged as an approach for the treatment of these diseases [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="459264"&gt;459264&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="476587"&gt;476587&lt;/ulink&gt;], [479028], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587791"&gt;587791&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;One means to selectively target IFNgamma for therapeutic purposes is by antibody-mediated blockade of its function. To this end, &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19162"&gt;Protein Design Labs Inc&lt;/ulink&gt; (PDL) has generated a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), called &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (alternatively known as HuZAF), that possesses binding and potent neutralizing activity against human IFNgamma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587792"&gt;587792&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;Fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; has been evaluated in two autoimmune diseases known to be associated with increased IFNgamma production: psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="526730"&gt;526730&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587797"&gt;587797&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587799"&gt;587799&lt;/ulink&gt;], and Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="466189"&gt;466189&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="513707"&gt;513707&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587805"&gt;587805&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These trials showed that the antibody was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile. Although a single dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was not sufficient to induce a significant clinical response in psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511332"&gt;511332&lt;/ulink&gt;] or CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="452003"&gt;452003&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="452048"&gt;452048&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="528130"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;], administration of two monthly doses of the mAb resulted in significantly improved responses and remission rates in CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="528130"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This result suggested that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; may have therapeutic activity in CD. A phase I study investigating the safety and pharmacology of multiple doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in CD has therefore been initiated, [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589815"&gt;589815&lt;/ulink&gt;], and PDL is seeking a partner to further develop &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; for the potential treatment of this disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589575"&gt;589575&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="579638"&gt;579638&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;Fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; has also been considered for evaluation in other autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="488784"&gt;488784&lt;/ulink&gt;] and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="488991"&gt;488991&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="528130"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;Fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; is derived from a high affinity murine mAb (named AF2) raised against recombinant human IFNgamma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587811"&gt;587811&lt;/ulink&gt;]. AF2 was selected for its potent IFNgamma-neutralizing activity, as measured by a blockade of the interaction of the cytokine with its cell surface receptor complex. The epitope recognized by AF2 was identified as a conformational determinant that comprises two non-contiguous amino acids juxtaposed in the tertiary structure of IFNgamma, in a portion of the cytokine that is proximal to, but distinct from, the surface that interacts with the IFNgamma receptor [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587811"&gt;587811&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;To generate &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the antigen binding site of AF2 were grafted into the framework regions of a human antibody (referred to as Eu) consisting of human IgG1 heavy chains and kappa light chains [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587792"&gt;587792&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587814"&gt;587814&lt;/ulink&gt;], [WO-00032634]. The variable heavy chain (VH) domain of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was designed using a human sequence with high homology to the original mouse sequence based on a best-sequence-fit approach [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587792"&gt;587792&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A framework residue (H11) distal to the antigen binding site at the interface between the variable and constant immunoglobulin domains was shown to be essential for preserving the antigen binding pocket conformation required for potent neutralization of IFNgamma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587792"&gt;587792&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Crystallographic evidence that the VH domain of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; structurally mimics that of its mouse precursor has recently been reported [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587821"&gt;587821&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;Fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was shown to possess IFNgamma-binding and -neutralizing activities closely comparable to those of AF2 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587792"&gt;587792&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;In an assay measuring the induction of MHC class II expression in a melanoma cell line by natural IFNgamma (~ 0.25 nM), addition of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; suppressed this induction with an IC90 value of &amp;lt; 1 nM [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587792"&gt;587792&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This indicated that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; can block IFNgamma activity at a molar ratio of &amp;lt; 4:1 &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; to IFNgamma molecules [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587792"&gt;587792&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Another in vitro study determined the effect of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; on the induction by IFNgamma of the secretion of chemokines, including IP-10, MIG and I-TAC, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the intestinal epithelial cell line HT29 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518854"&gt;518854&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This is an important parameter because during inflammation the production of IFNgamma is thought to lead to increased local levels of such chemokines, which in turn selectively recruit activated T-cells by interacting with their receptor, CXCR3 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587811"&gt;587811&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The secretion of IP-10 in PBMC from healthy individuals (stimulated via CD3/CD28 for 4 days) was dose-dependently inhibited by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (IC50 = 10 microg/ml, IC90 = 100 microg/ml) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518854"&gt;518854&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A similar effect was observed in IFNgamma-stimulated HT-29 cells, where &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; produced &amp;gt; 90% inhibition at 10 microg/ml. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;Fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; also prevented the phosphorylation of STAT-1 and the upregulation of HLA-DR induced by IFNgamma in these cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518854"&gt;518854&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further evidence that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; inhibited the production of IFNgamma-induced chemokines was obtained using a CXCR3-dependent chemotaxis assay, in which the chemotactic capacity of the supernatant from stimulated PBMCs was reduced by ~ 50 to 60% after incubation with the mAb [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518854"&gt;518854&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;In chimpanzees, a single intravenous infusion of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; at 2 or 20 mg/kg resulted in average distribution and elimination half-lives (t1/2) of 21.1 h and 14.5 days, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518865"&gt;518865&lt;/ulink&gt;], [WO-03097082].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In healthy human volunteers, the Cmax of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; increased dose-proportionally from 0.16 to 78 microg/ml after single intravenous doses ranging from 0.01 to 4 mg/kg. The elimination t1/2 was also dose-dependent, ranging from 13.8 to 24.7 days [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387632"&gt;387632&lt;/ulink&gt;], [WO-03097082].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In CD patients who received a single intravenous dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; at 0.1, 1.0 or 4.0 mg/kg, pharmacokinetic parameters fit a two-compartment model. Cmax averaged from 1.0 to 73.3 microg/ml and elimination t1/2 averaged from 9 to 23 days, which is consistent with the aforementioned values obtained in healthy individuals [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="538242"&gt;538242&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;A range of studies with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; have been conducted in chimpanzees, some of which examined toxicology and immunogenicity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518865"&gt;518865&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Studies reportedly ranged from 42-day single-dose acute studies to multi-dose chronic studies of 336 days duration. However, other than an oral presentation at the Annual Meeting of the American College of Toxicology in 2002, no results have apparently been published [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518865"&gt;518865&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;A phase I escalating-dose study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was conducted in healthy volunteers (n = 22). &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;Fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was administered in single intravenous doses ranging from 0.01 to 4 mg/kg, which resulted in no serious or severe adverse effects. DTH responses to mumps and Candida antigens were reduced &amp;gt; 90% at 48 h after &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; doses of 0.03 mg/kg or higher, demonstrating that the mAb has immunosuppressive efficacy in vivo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387632"&gt;387632&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, dose-escalation study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was completed in patients (n = 35) with plaque psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="482596"&gt;482596&lt;/ulink&gt;], [WO-03097082]. Patients were randomized to receive single intravenous infusions of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (0.1, 1.0, 3.0 or 10 mg/kg) or placebo. The psoriasis area severity index (PASI) was determined as a measure of disease activity. On days 15 and 29 post-dosing, mean PASI scores were reduced by 31.9 and 21.9%, respectively, with the 3 mg/kg dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, as compared to 4.3 and 8.3%, respectively, with the 0.1 mg/kg dose [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="482596"&gt;482596&lt;/ulink&gt;], [WO-03097082]. At the 10 mg/kg dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, three out of four patients showed histological improvement of their lesions [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="482596"&gt;482596&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase I, open-label, multi-dose, dose-escalation trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; to explore safety and pharmacology in patients with moderate to severe CD was underway at the time of publication [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589815"&gt;589815&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Participants were to be administered four doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; as intravenous infusions over a period of 10 weeks.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I/II&lt;/subtitle&gt;A phase I/II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was conducted in patients (n = 45) with moderate to severely active CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="451111"&gt;451111&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="452003"&gt;452003&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="452048"&gt;452048&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This study comprised two stages. In stage A, patients received a single intravenous infusion of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; at 0.1, 1.0, or 4.0 mg/kg (n = 6, 14 and 15, respectively) or placebo (n = 10), and were evaluated 4 weeks thereafter. Clinical response was defined as a 70-point decrease in CD activity index (CDAI), and remission corresponded to a CDAI    ≤ 150. Increased doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; were found to correlate with higher rates of clinical response and greater numbers of remission. At 0.1 mg/kg, 50% of the patients responded and none achieved a remission, while at 4 mg/kg, 71% of patients responded and 50% achieved a remission. However, a high response rate was observed in the placebo group, where 60% of the patients showed a clinical response and 40% achieved remission, such that the effect of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; at 4 mg/kg was not significantly different from placebo. The patients who responded to the drug in stage A were then re-randomized to enter phase B of the trial, in which they received three additional doses of either &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (0.05, 0.5 or 2.0 mg/kg iv) or placebo at 4-week intervals. A total of eleven of the thirteen patients treated with the drug in stage B, and three of the four patients who received placebo retained their response or remission on day 113 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="452003"&gt;452003&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="452048"&gt;452048&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further analyses revealed that the total serum level of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; correlated positively with the improvement in CDAI observed on day 29, and negatively with the serum level of IP-10 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="538242"&gt;538242&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;The first phase II trial (HARMONY I) evaluated &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; at 1 or 4 mg/kg in CD patients (n = 196). In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, the drug or placebo were given in a single intravenous infusion over 60 min. A clinical response was defined as a 100-point reduction in CDAI score, which was more stringent than in the previous phase I/II trial. Using this criterion, there were no statistically significant differences in response between the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; groups and the placebo group on day 28 following the infusion. A clinical response was noted in 39% of the patients who received the drug at 1 mg/kg (n = 78) and 33% of those who received the drug at 4 mg/kg (n = 78), as compared to 38% of the patients who received the placebo (n = 40) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="528130"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a second phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial (HARMONY II), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was tested as an initial intravenous infusion of 4 or 10 mg/kg, followed by an additional intravenous dose at study day 28 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="528130"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This trial involved 133 patients with moderate to severe CD. As in HARMONY I, a 100-point reduction in CDAI score defined a positive clinical response. On day 28 after the initial dose, a clinical response was achieved by 38% of the patients who received &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; at 4 mg/kg (n = 45), and 44% of those who received the drug at 10 mg/kg (n = 45). These response rates were not statistically different from that observed in the placebo group (n = 43), where 33% of the patients responded. Therefore, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; failed to meet the primary endpoint at study day 28 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="528130"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, when patients (n = 91) were given a second intravenous dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; on day 28, significant differences in response rates were observed at subsequent time points. On day 56, 69% and 67% of the patients achieved a clinical response in the 4 and 10 mg/kg &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; groups, respectively, as compared with 35% of the patients in the placebo group [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="528130"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="566219"&gt;566219&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The beneficial effect of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; compared to placebo was also manifested by a significant reduction in mean CDAI scores until the end of the follow-up period, at study day 112. Moreover, the percent of remission was higher for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; than for placebo, especially in those patients who had an elevated serum level (&gt; 4 mg/ml) of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, at the start of the study [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="566219"&gt;566219&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. From day 28 throughout, the median level of CRP was markedly reduced in the patients treated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; compared to placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;Administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (at doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg) by a single intravenous infusion over 60 min was well tolerated in the various clinical trials in healthy volunteers [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387632"&gt;387632&lt;/ulink&gt;] and patients with psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="482596"&gt;482596&lt;/ulink&gt;] or CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="452003"&gt;452003&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="528130"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. All reported adverse events that could be attributed to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, most commonly a flu-like syndrome, were considered only mild to moderate [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="452003"&gt;452003&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="528130"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; appeared minimally immunogenic, since only one of the 35 CD patients treated with a dose of 4 mg/kg developed transiently-detectable, but clinically non-relevant, anti-&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; antibodies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="538242"&gt;538242&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Patent Summary &lt;/subtitle&gt;A patent application assigned to PDL, WO-09211018, published in July 1992, first described the murine anti-human IFNgamma mAb AF2. Evidence that this mAb potently neutralizes IFNgamma in a functional assay is reported. Amino acid sequences and the corresponding oligonucleotide sequences of the light and the heavy chains of a humanized version of AF2 are also presented.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Humanized antibodies to human IFNgamma, including &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, are further described and claimed to be useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases in WO-00032634, published in June 2000. The antibodies were constructed with CDRs of the AF2 mAb functionally joined to framework and variable regions of the human Eu antibody. The amino acids from the mouse antibody were substituted for the original human framework residues based of computer modeling. Framework residues that occurred only rarely at their positions in the database of human antibodies were replaced by a human consensus amino acid at those positions or by the corresponding mouse antibody amino acids. In &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, position H11 was substituted with the amino acid occupying the equivalent position of the heavy chain of AF2. The final sequences of the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; light and heavy chain variable domains incorporating all of the substitutions are listed. Two other humanized mAbs were also designed: Haf25, which lacks substitutions at positions H11 and H38, and HuXAF, which lacks a substitution at position H38. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;Fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; is demonstrated to display an IFNgamma neutralizing activity that is significantly better than that of Haf25 and slightly higher than that of HuXAF, indicating that H11 substitution makes an important contribution to this activity.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Another PDL patent application, WO-03097082, published in November 2003, claims the utility of anti-IFNgamma antibodies for the treatment of CD or psoriasis. Data from the phase I/II study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="452003"&gt;452003&lt;/ulink&gt;] and from the phase I study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="482596"&gt;482596&lt;/ulink&gt;] are presented to support this contention.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;Fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was designed for the purpose of selectively blocking the action of human IFNgamma. The data obtained so far indicate that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; achieved this goal. It proved capable of potently neutralizing the biological activity of IFNgamma in vitro [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="518854"&gt;518854&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587792"&gt;587792&lt;/ulink&gt;], and of inhibiting the production of an IFNgamma-induced chemokine (IP-10) in vivo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="538242"&gt;538242&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The latter effect is important since there is evidence that IFNgamma-induced chemokines play a critical role in T-cell recruitment to inflammatory sites [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587823"&gt;587823&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587881"&gt;587881&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition, when administered intravenously to healthy human volunteers or patients, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; displayed the desirable attributes of a slow rate of elimination [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387632"&gt;387632&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="538242"&gt;538242&lt;/ulink&gt;] and low immunogenicity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="538242"&gt;538242&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It was also well tolerated, and did not cause any major side effect, at least during the relatively short follow-up periods of the studies performed to date [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387632"&gt;387632&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="482596"&gt;482596&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="452003"&gt;452003&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="528130"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These properties make &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; an agent suitable for further clinical evaluation. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;One major question is whether the inhibition of IFNgamma by &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; would provide a therapeutic benefit in disease conditions where this cytokine is suspected to play an important pathogenic role. This was addressed in psoriasis and CD, which are both chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorders predominantly driven by Th1-type immunity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="526730"&gt;526730&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587805"&gt;587805&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Collectively, the results of the trials conducted in these diseases showed that a single dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, was not sufficient to produce a significant clinical response when compared with placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="482596"&gt;482596&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="528130"&gt;528130&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By contrast, single injections of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; at doses as low as 0.03 mg/kg significantly reduced DTH skin reactions in healthy volunteers [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="387632"&gt;387632&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Hence, the doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; tested in psoriasis and CD would be expected to be pharmacologically active with respect to IFNgamma inhibition. It is nevertheless possible that in the case of chronic inflammation, higher dose levels of the mAb are required in order to penetrate diseased tissues and block the action of IFNgamma in situ. Another possibility is that the pathogenic effects of IFNgamma are protracted such that, to be beneficial, the blockade of this cytokine needs to persist longer than the clearance rate of a single &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; dose. In support of this possibility, the latest phase II study in CD patients demonstrated a significant clinical improvement compared to placebo when &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was administered twice, 4 weeks apart [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This suggests that, provided the cumulative dose and duration of treatment are high enough, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; has the potential to exert a therapeutic action in CD. Obviously, additional studies, including the ongoing multi-dose phase I trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in patients with moderate to severe CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589575"&gt;589575&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589815"&gt;589815&lt;/ulink&gt;] will be necessary to determine the validity of this conclusion. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The results obtained with two infusions of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; compare favorably with the efficacy data of other biological therapies that have been evaluated in CD. For instance, repeated infusions are also required for the chimeric anti-TNFalpha mAb &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6850"&gt;infliximab&lt;/ulink&gt; to be effective at maintaining remission in CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587826"&gt;587826&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6850"&gt;Infliximab&lt;/ulink&gt; is, at present, the only biological agent approved for the treatment of CD, but it has beneficial activity in only about 30% of patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587837"&gt;587837&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, its immunogenicity often leads to a loss of clinical response after multiple dosing [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587842"&gt;587842&lt;/ulink&gt;], and its use is associated with increased risks of tuberculosis and lymphoma and the occurrence of SLE and new-onset demyelination [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587844"&gt;587844&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589588"&gt;589588&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although the problem of immunogenicity should be mitigated with the fully human anti-TNFalpha mAb, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14163"&gt;adalimumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="13601"&gt;Abbott Laboratories&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="582555"&gt;582555&lt;/ulink&gt;], it is clear that TNFalpha blockade is not the ultimate strategy for the treatment of CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587853"&gt;587853&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Another recent approach is the blockade of the alpha4-integrin adhesion molecule with the humanized mAb, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511461"&gt;511461&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The clinical response obtained using this agent in CD was similar to that seen with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;], since 51 to 71% of CD patients who received two &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; infusions exhibited a 70-point reduction in CDAI scores as compared to 38% of those who received placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511461"&gt;511461&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Note, however, that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, which had been approved for use in multiple sclerosis, was recently withdrawn due to the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in three patients treated with the antibody, including one in a CD clinical trial [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="592477"&gt;592477&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The inability of each one of the aforementioned biological agents to induce a clinical response in a majority of patients may reflect the heterogeneity of the pathogenic mechanisms leading to CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587805"&gt;587805&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587869"&gt;587869&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In future studies, it may thus be worthwhile to determine whether &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; would complement or be synergistic with other agents to achieve higher rates of therapeutic responses. Alternatively, a better understanding of the immunoregulatory defects and genetic factors that cause the disease may help identify those patients who are most likely to respond to a particular treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511461"&gt;511461&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587869"&gt;587869&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this respect, it is interesting that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; appeared most effective in the patients with high CRP serum level [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="589547"&gt;589547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This parameter may thus guide the selection of CD patients for further evaluation of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;While &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; is the only specific IFNgamma antagonist to be currently developed, another reagent targeting Th1 responses, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="24303"&gt;ABT-874&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="13601"&gt;Abbott Laboratories&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="24236"&gt;Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc&lt;/ulink&gt;) is under evaluation for the potential treatment of CD and other autoimmune diseases. This reagent is a humanized mAb directed to the p40 subunit of IL-12, a cytokine that initiates Th1-mediated inflammation in part by promoting IFNgamma production [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587872"&gt;587872&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Since IL-12 p40 is a component of IL-23, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="24303"&gt;ABT-874&lt;/ulink&gt; is also likely to block the latter cytokine, which plays an important role in the differentiation of autoreactive pathogenic T-cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587873"&gt;587873&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A recent study in 79 patients with active CD showed that after seven weekly subcutaneous injections of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="24303"&gt;ABT-874&lt;/ulink&gt;, 75% of patients experienced a clinical response (&gt; 100 point-drop in CDAI) as compared to 25% of patients in the placebo group [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="578232"&gt;578232&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The clinical improvement in patients receiving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="24303"&gt;ABT-874&lt;/ulink&gt; was accompanied by decreased IFNgamma and TNFalpha production in the colonic lamina propria [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="578232"&gt;578232&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Therefore, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="24303"&gt;ABT-874&lt;/ulink&gt; may have therapeutic effects that overlap those of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;. However, it is also possible that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="24303"&gt;ABT-874&lt;/ulink&gt; may prove more effective than &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in additional CD trials as there is evidence that IL-12 (and/or IL-23) plays a more critical pathogenic role than IFNgamma in mouse models of colitis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="592581"&gt;592581&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="592584"&gt;592584&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="592585"&gt;592585&lt;/ulink&gt;], with the caveat that such models are imperfect surrogates for therapeutic responses in human CD. At present, it is thus unclear whether these two compounds would compete commercially with each other if they were to be approved for clinical use in CD.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Besides the question of therapeutic efficacy, future clinical trials of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in CD will need to address the potential adverse consequences of a prolonged blockade of IFNgamma. Since this cytokine is involved in host defenses [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587648"&gt;587648&lt;/ulink&gt;], it seems possible that its long-term inhibition might predispose patients to infections, as seen in the case of TNFalpha blockade [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587844"&gt;587844&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, there is evidence that, in addition to its pro-inflammatory function, IFNgamma also exerts anti-inflammatory effects in certain situations [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587874"&gt;587874&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587878"&gt;587878&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This may be due to the fact that IFNgamma can induce the production of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, an enzyme that promotes tryptophan catabolism and kynurenine formation, and thereby suppresses T-cell proliferation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="530750"&gt;530750&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Therefore, the possibility that chronic treatment with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; might exacerbate disease manifestations in some patients will have to be carefully examined. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In conclusion, the preliminary evidence that repeated administration of fontolozimab has clinical and biological activity in CD is encouraging and deserves to be further investigated. This appears particularly warranted given the incurable nature and increasing worldwide incidence of CD, which clearly call for novel agents to facilitate the clinical management of this debilitating disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587837"&gt;587837&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587853"&gt;587853&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587880"&gt;587880&lt;/ulink&gt;]. If &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7183"&gt;fontolizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; were to be found useful for the treatment of CD, further evaluation of its therapeutic potential in other autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, SLE and RA may also be justified. &lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="1005244">Biogen Inc</Company><Country
