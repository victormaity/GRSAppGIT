In the US, the product as an oral capsule is indicated for the treatment of adults with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and an amenable galactosidase alpha gene (GLA) variant based on in vitro assay data [&lt;ulink linkID="2062538" linkType="Reference"&gt;2062538&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2016, migalastat was launched in Germany [&lt;ulink linkID="1767700" linkType="Reference"&gt;1767700&lt;/ulink&gt;];  in February 2017, the drug was launched in the UK [&lt;ulink linkID="1903857" linkType="Reference"&gt;1903857&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in March 2017, the drug was launched in Italy [&lt;ulink linkID="1907065" linkType="Reference"&gt;1907065&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2018,  the drug was launched in Japan for Fabry disease [&lt;ulink linkID="2016600" linkType="Reference"&gt;2016600&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2038352" linkType="Reference"&gt;2038352&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In August  2018, the US FDA  granted Accelerated Approval for  migalastat for Fabry disease; the product was immediately launched [&lt;ulink linkID="2062302" linkType="Reference"&gt;2062302&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2062501" linkType="Reference"&gt;2062501&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2018, a phase IIIb study was initiated in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 18 years with Fabry's disease [&lt;ulink linkID="2096873" linkType="Reference"&gt;2096873&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Amicus is also developing &lt;ulink linkID="79475" linkType="Drug"&gt;migalastat co-formulated with JR-	051&lt;/ulink&gt; (a biosimilar a-Gal A enzyme replacement therapy) for the potential treatment of all Fabry disease patients (independent of genetic mutation) [&lt;ulink linkID="1392030" linkType="Reference"&gt;1392030&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1553396" linkType="Reference"&gt;1553396&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;ulink linkID="28355" linkType="Company"&gt;&lt;/ulink&gt;Amicus and former licensee GSK were also previously developing migalastat  in combination with marketed enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) for Fabry disease; in October 2012, a phase II trial of  migalastat in combination with the marketed  ERTs &lt;ulink linkID="11205" linkType="Drug"&gt;Fabrazyme&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="14366" linkType="Drug"&gt;Replagal&lt;/ulink&gt; was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1139469" linkType="Reference"&gt;1139469&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2013, Amicus and GSK were still considering further development of migalastat co-administered with marketed ERTs [&lt;ulink linkID="1383143" linkType="Reference"&gt;1383143&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, by May 2013, the companies were focusing on co-formulating migalastat with their proprietary investigational ERT, &lt;ulink linkID="65147" linkType="Drug"&gt;JR-051&lt;/ulink&gt;, in-licensed from   &lt;ulink linkID="17330" linkType="Company"&gt;JCR Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt;,    [&lt;ulink linkID="1418414" linkType="Reference"&gt;1418414&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="1553396" linkType="Reference"&gt;1553396&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In February 2012, Amicus stated that the use of migalastat in the treatment of Fabry disease was covered by six licensed patents in the US expiring in 2018, and by corresponding patents in Europe, Japan and Canada expiring in 2019, exclusive of any patent-term extensions (these patents include claims covering methods of increasing the activity of and preventing the degradation of alpha-Gal A, and methods for  treating Fabry disease using migalastat) [&lt;ulink linkID="1905064" linkType="Reference"&gt;1905064&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition, the company jointly owned a US method patent with an expiry date of 2027, for which a divisional application was pending, and a patent related to the commercial preparation of migalastat that  was anticipated to lead to a patent with an expiry date of 2026; by March 2015, the commercial preparation of migalastat patent had been granted in the US and expires in 2026 [&lt;ulink linkID="1641390" linkType="Reference"&gt;1641390&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At that time, several patent applications were pending in the US; the latest patent expiry date of the pending patents was expected to be 2029. Amicus also planned to or had filed US and foreign counterparts of the applications. Patent applications were also pending in the US, Europe, Canada, Brazil China, Hong Kong,  Israel, Japan and Mexico covering administration of migalastat plus ERT, with an anticipated expiry date of 2024 if issued; the counterpart patent in India had been issued. In addition, a provisional patent application in the US covering administration of migalastat plus ERT had an anticipated expiry date of 2032 if issued [&lt;ulink linkID="1268930" linkType="Reference"&gt;1268930&lt;/ulink&gt;]; foreign counterparts of the application were pending in Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan and South Africa, with an anticipated expiry date between 2032 to 2033 [&lt;ulink linkID="1641390" linkType="Reference"&gt;1641390&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By  March 2015, patents covering specific combinations had been issued in Europe, China, India and Mexico, which expires in 2024; other applications from this patent family were pending in the US, Europe, Canada, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan and Mexico, with an anticipated expiry date of 2024 if issued [&lt;ulink linkID="1641390" linkType="Reference"&gt;1641390&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By March 2015, patents covering specific combinations had been issued in Europe, China, India and Mexico, which expires in 2024; other applications from this patent family were pending in the US, Europe, Canada, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan and Mexico, with an anticipated expiry date of 2024 if issued. At that time, Amicus stated that it owned an issued US patent covering a method of treating Fabry disease patients who have several alpha-galactosidase A mutations with migalastat, which expire in 2029; the company had filed foreign counterparts of that patent in Japan, Canada, Mexico and Australia, with an anticipated expiry date of 2029 if issued [&lt;ulink linkID="1641390" linkType="Reference"&gt;1641390&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2017, Amicus stated that it owned two issued US patents related to the dosing regimen of migalastat which expires in 2027, exclusive of any patent-term extensions as well as a pending application which, if granted, also expires in 2027; foreign counterpart patents were issued in Australia, Europe, Hong Kong, and Japan, and foreign applications were pending in Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, and Mexico. At that time, Amicus owned an issued US patent directed to synthetic steps related to the commercial process for preparing migalastat, which expires in 2026, including issued patents in China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel and Japan with foreign counterpart applications pending in Brazil and India. Additionally, Amicus jointly owned issued patents in the US, Europe, Hong Kong and Mexican covering a method of determining whether male Fabry disease patients were likely to respond to treatment with migalastat which expires in 2027. Amicus also owned two issued US patents covering a method of treating a patient diagnosed with Fabry disease with migalastat whom has one of several alpha-Gal A mutations, which expires in 2029. In addition, the company had a pending US application covering a method of determining which alpha-Gal A mutations were likely to be amenable to migalastat treatment which, if granted, expires in 2029; foreign counterpart patents have been issued in Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico and Australia, which expires in 2029 [&lt;ulink linkID="1905064" linkType="Reference"&gt;1905064&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/PatentsAndGenerics&gt;</value></PatentsAndGenerics><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;By February 2012, the FDA had prohibited  use of the tradename Amigal in the US [&lt;ulink linkID="1268930" linkType="Reference"&gt;1268930&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2008, an end of phase II meeting with the FDA was planned. The agency indicated the  data from the completed phase II studies supported the start of phase III trials, and that migalastat met the requirements for accelerated approval [&lt;ulink linkID="931265" linkType="Reference"&gt;931265&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By August 2012, the FDA had indicated that it would include the 12-month biopsy data from the phase III 011 study to evaluate the efficacy of migalastat, following its Type C meeting with Amicus. At that time, data from the 011 trial would form the basis of approval [&lt;ulink linkID="1287038" linkType="Reference"&gt;1287038&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2013, the FDA indicated that it would consider the complete efficacy and safety data profile for both the stage 1 and 2 parts of study 011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1354922" linkType="Reference"&gt;1354922&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1384163" linkType="Reference"&gt;1384163&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1392030" linkType="Reference"&gt;1392030&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In March 2015, Amicus planned to file  for accelerated approval in the US under Subpart H for the monotherapy of Fabry disease following a Type C meeting with the FDA to review the data from Study 011 and Study 012 and discuss the approval pathway; as part of Subpart H approval a post-approval confirmatory study was required [&lt;ulink linkID="1643350" linkType="Reference"&gt;1643350&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By September 2015, a pre-NDA meeting had been held with the FDA. At that time, the company anticipated providing a protocol submission for the phase IV study required by the Subpart H approval at the same time as filing [&lt;ulink linkID="1695193" linkType="Reference"&gt;1695193&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2015, further follow-up discussions occurred and Amicus received final FDA minutes from the pre-NDA meeting. The FDA required additional data on the effect of the drug on GI symptoms in Fabry disease to support full US approval and a Subpart H strategy. Additionally, the agency requested further integration of existing clinical data across studies. At that time, submission was no longer expected by the end of 2015 [&lt;ulink linkID="1699894" linkType="Reference"&gt;1699894&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2016, during discussions and review of a briefing document submitted by Amicus, the FDA indicated that kidney globotriaosylceramide was  not considered a basis for an accelerated approval under Subpart H. Amicus planned to collect additional data on  GI symptoms in Fabry patients who have an amenable mutation required for full approval of migalastat in the US; at that time,  Amicus was working with the agency to finalize the protocol for a pivotal, crossover-design study in treatment-naive Fabry patients who had an amenable mutation and GI symptoms; data were expected in 2019. An intermediate Expanded Access Program (EAP) was planned to ensure short-term access to US  patients currently on enzyme replacement therapies who met EAP requirements [&lt;ulink linkID="1878864" linkType="Reference"&gt;1878864&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2017, the FDA informed Amicus that no further studies were required and that an NDA could be submitted, due to additionally submitted data analysis from existing studies [&lt;ulink linkID="1944328" linkType="Reference"&gt;1944328&lt;/ulink&gt;]. in December 2017, Amicus submitted an NDA for the treatment of Fabry disease. The filing was based on the data from two phase III studies (FACETS and ATTRACT) [&lt;ulink linkID="1991770" linkType="Reference"&gt;1991770&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2018, the FDA accepted the NDA for priority review and a PDUFA date was set for August 13, 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="2004545" linkType="Reference"&gt;2004545&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August  2018, the US FDA  granted accelerated approval of the drug for the treatment of adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and an amenable GLA variant; the product was immediately launched. As a condition of the Accelerated Approval, the drug would be studied in a confirmatory phase IV program [&lt;ulink linkID="2062302" linkType="Reference"&gt;2062302&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2062501" linkType="Reference"&gt;2062501&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2004, the FDA granted  Orphan Drug status [&lt;ulink linkID="661272" linkType="Reference"&gt;661272&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2017, the FDA awarded  Fast Track designation for the treatment of Fabry disease with amenable mutations [&lt;ulink linkID="1963622" linkType="Reference"&gt;1963622&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;By March 2017, migalastat had been approved in Switzerland for  Fabry disease [&lt;ulink linkID="1904920" linkType="Reference"&gt;1904920&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The drug had been launched in Switzerland by March 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="2011170" linkType="Reference"&gt;2011170&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By June 2009, Amicus and Shire had completed a series of discussions with the EMA, which had recommended a head-to-head registration trial evaluating migalastat  in males and females with Fabry disease compared to ERT [&lt;ulink linkID="975932" linkType="Reference"&gt;975932&lt;/ulink&gt;&lt;ulink&gt;&lt;/ulink&gt;],   [&lt;ulink linkID="1020055" linkType="Reference"&gt;1020055&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2014, a benefit/risk assessment in Europe was expected to be based on both overall data from Study 012 and results from the entire clinical development program [&lt;ulink linkID="1573835" linkType="Reference"&gt;1573835&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2014, positive data from Study 012 were reported. At that time, the company planned to proceed with submitting an MAA to the EMA under the Centralized Procedure for the approval of migalastat for Fabry disease [&lt;ulink linkID="1586507" linkType="Reference"&gt;1586507&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in December 2014, a successful pre-submission meeting occurred [&lt;ulink linkID="1620169" linkType="Reference"&gt;1620169&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2015, the EMA's CHMP granted the proposed migalastat filing Accelerated Assessment  [&lt;ulink linkID="1663289" linkType="Reference"&gt;1663289&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2015, Amicus filed an MAA under the Centralized Procedure with the EMA for Fabry patients who have amenable mutations; at that time, the company planned to pursue a country-by-country  approval process after authorization [&lt;ulink linkID="1666339" linkType="Reference"&gt;1666339&lt;/ulink&gt;]; the filing was accepted later that  month for Accelerated Assessment [&lt;ulink linkID="1673487" linkType="Reference"&gt;1673487&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2016,  AmicusÂ initiated an EAP to make the drug accessible to Fabry patients with amenable mutations; temporary use authorization  was granted in France [&lt;ulink linkID="1745562" linkType="Reference"&gt;1745562&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2016, the EMA's CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of the drug with a label that would include all 269 amenable mutations screened through Amicus' Amenability Assay [&lt;ulink linkID="1748273" linkType="Reference"&gt;1748273&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1748656" linkType="Reference"&gt;1748656&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2016, the EC approved the drug for Fabry disease in the EU   and Liechtenstein, based mainly on results from Study 011 and Study 012. Migalastat was immediately launched in Germany; at that time the product was approved in Iceland  and launch  was presumed to have ocurred shortly after [&lt;ulink linkID="1767700" linkType="Reference"&gt;1767700&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2072461" linkType="Reference"&gt;2072461&lt;/ulink&gt;]; by October 2016, the product was available in Norway [&lt;ulink linkID="2072467" linkType="Reference"&gt;2072467&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2017, the product was launched in the UK [&lt;ulink linkID="1903857" linkType="Reference"&gt;1903857&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2017, the drug was launched in Italy [&lt;ulink linkID="1907065" linkType="Reference"&gt;1907065&lt;/ulink&gt;]; by that time, the product had been launched in France through a temporary authorisations for use and additional EU-five launches were expected  [&lt;ulink linkID="1905153" linkType="Reference"&gt;1905153&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2017, the drug was launched in France [&lt;ulink linkID="1923347" linkType="Reference"&gt;1923347&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By June 2017, the  EU label included 313 GLA mutations that had been identified and determined to be amenable based on screening using the Galafold Amenability Assay; at that time,  Amicus expected to submit additional GLA mutation updates to the label as   mutations become identified and tested in the Galafold Amenability Assay [&lt;ulink linkID="1941733" linkType="Reference"&gt;1941733&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2018, the drug was launched in Spain [&lt;ulink linkID="1998111" linkType="Reference"&gt;1998111&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2006, the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products recommended granting Orphan Drug status for Fabry disease [&lt;ulink linkID="661272" linkType="Reference"&gt;661272&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in May 2006, European Orphan status was granted [&lt;ulink linkID="1173958" linkType="Reference"&gt;1173958&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2016, the COMP recommended keeping the drug on the EU registry of orphan medicinal products for the treatment of Fabry disease [&lt;ulink linkID="1756764" linkType="Reference"&gt;1756764&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Japan&lt;/subtitle&gt;In August 2016, Amicus  stated that based on  the outcome of  a meeting with with the PMDA, a filing in Japan would include data from completed clinical studies, as well as a phase I study that  evaluated the pharmacokinetics of migalastat in Japanese volunteers; the PMDA did not require a further trial in Japanese patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1785326" linkType="Reference"&gt;1785326&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2017, Amicus submitted a Japanese NDA to the PMDA  seeking marketing authorization for migalastat for Fabry disease [&lt;ulink linkID="1941733" linkType="Reference"&gt;1941733&lt;/ulink&gt;];  in March 2018, the drug was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients aged 16 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and who have an amenable mutation.

The study was completed in February 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1241354" linkType="Reference"&gt;1241354&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2017, further clinical data were presented at the 13th ICIEM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The mean annualized rate of change in estimated GFR (CKD-EPI) from baseline to month-48 was â 0.7 ml/min/1.73 m2. The most common adverse event reported was mild to moderate headache. Few serious adverse events were considered related to migalastat [&lt;ulink linkID="1966190" linkType="Reference"&gt;1966190&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In September 2009, the first patient was randomized to receive migalastat or placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1268930" linkType="Reference"&gt;1268930&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2011, patient recruitment was closed [&lt;ulink linkID="1020325" linkType="Reference"&gt;1020325&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1232137" linkType="Reference"&gt;1232137&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Enrollment was completed in December 2011, at 67 patients  [&lt;ulink linkID="1249884" linkType="Reference"&gt;1249884&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2012, data were presented at the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) Symposium, in Birmingham, UK. A total of 67 out of 180 patients (37%) who underwent screening had a-gal A mutations and were enrolled in the study. The 6-month primary treatment period was completed in 2Q12 and the 6-month follow-up period was expected to complete in 4Q12 [&lt;ulink linkID="1321374" linkType="Reference"&gt;1321374&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2012, topline 6-month data were reported; a &amp;gt;/= 50% reduction in kidney interstitial capillary GL-3 was observed in 41% of  migalastat-treated patients compared with 28% of placebo-treated patients. The difference was not statistically significant [&lt;ulink linkID="1351830" linkType="Reference"&gt;1351830&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In February 2013, similar 6-month data were presented at the 9th Annual Lysosomal Disease Network WORLD Symposium in Orlando, FL [&lt;ulink linkID="1384163" linkType="Reference"&gt;1384163&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In 2Q13, Amicus had a Type C Meeting with the FDA, and subsequently revised the statistical analysis plan to pre-specify the primary analysis at month 12 as the mean change in GL-3 in patients with amenable mutations in a GLP-validated human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell-based in vitro (GLP HEK) assay [&lt;ulink linkID="1551584" linkType="Reference"&gt;1551584&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2014,  data from a post-hoc analysis of stage 1 were presented at the 10th Annual World Symposium of the Lysosomal Disease Network in San Diego, CA. Using the GLP HEK assay to further predict patients who had mutations amenable to migalastat treatment, 15 of the 67 patients previously deemed amenable were no longer considered so. Analysis of those patients considered amenable using the new assay revealed a change from baseline in mean number of GL-3 inclusions per capillary of -0.31 for migalastat compared with +0.10 for placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1528560" linkType="Reference"&gt;1528560&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1528562" linkType="Reference"&gt;1528562&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At that time, the company was planning to analyze mean change in GL-3Â at 12-months (stage 2) in the modified-intent-to treat population and also in the subgroup of patients deemed amenable using the GLP HEK assay [&lt;ulink linkID="1524280" linkType="Reference"&gt;1524280&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2014, 12- and 24-month data from Fabry patients with amenable mutations were announced. In GLP HEK amenable patients who switched from placebo to migalastat after month 6, a significant reduction in kidney interstitial capillary GL-3 at month 12 was observed; GLP HEK amenable patients treated for 12 months with migalastat had a durable reduction in kidney interstitial capillary. In GLP HEK amenable patients, kidney function  remained stable over 18 to  24 months [&lt;ulink linkID="1551584" linkType="Reference"&gt;1551584&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2014, similar  data were presented at SSIEM 2014 in Innsbrck, Austria. Gb3 reduction in podocytes, mesangial cells and glomerular endothelial cells was also observed in 22 to 48% of patients receiving migalastat for 12 months [&lt;ulink linkID="1589464" linkType="Reference"&gt;1589464&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Levels of Lyso-Gb3 were significantly reduced following treatment with migalastat at months 6 and 12 in patients with amenable mutations; no decreases were observed in patients with non-amenable mutations and larger decreases were observed in patients with higher baseline levels [&lt;ulink linkID="1589496" linkType="Reference"&gt;1589496&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In October 2014, additional data were presented at American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA, from patients in this study and those in the extension Study 041. Data demonstrated that migalastat treatment for at least 18 months resulted in continued stability of kidney function for an average of 32 months. The mean  estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  over an average of 32 months with migalastat in Studies 011 and 041 was -0.20 and +0.63 using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formulas, respectively;  when patients were stratified for gender and baseline proteinuria, patients treated with migalastat experienced less decline in kidney function than untreated patients from a previously published natural history study. Additional subgroup analysis comparing the change in GL-3 substrate levels between amenable patients and non-amenable patients based on the GLP HEK cell assay confirmed that patients with amenable mutations had declining levels of GL-3 when treated for 6 months with migalastat, while patients with non-amenable mutations had no change or increasing levels of GL-3 after 6 months of migalastat treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="1603398" linkType="Reference"&gt;1603398&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Also in October 2014, data were presented at ASHG Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA. The change in mean annualized estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over 18 to 24 months with migalastat hydrochloride in AT1001-011 study was -0.30 and +0.79 ml/min/1.73 m2/year using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formulas, respectively. In study AT1001-011, fatigue and paresthesia were serious adverse events  reported by one patient [&lt;ulink linkID="1605029" linkType="Reference"&gt;1605029&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2015, cardiac endpoint data  were reported.

In the same month, similar data were presented at 33rd Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="1628530" linkType="Reference"&gt;1628530&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2015, pre-specified secondary and tertiary endpoint data on patient-reported outcome measures  assessed in 50 patients with amenable mutations were presented at the 11th Annual Lysosomal Disease Network WORLD Symposium in Orlando, FL. After  18 to 24 months of treatment, improvements in GI symptoms were observed, including significant improvements in diarrhea and indigestion and favorable trends in reflux and constipation [&lt;ulink linkID="1632804" linkType="Reference"&gt;1632804&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1635086" linkType="Reference"&gt;1635086&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In September 2016, further data were presented at the SSIEM 2016 Annual Symposium in Rome, Italy. Over 24 months, the annualized rate of change in eGFR (CKD-EPI) with migalastat was â0.3 ml/min/1.73 m2. By 7.7 g/m2, LVMi decreased [&lt;ulink linkID="1894722" linkType="Reference"&gt;1894722&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. An improvement from baseline of &amp;gt;/= 0.4 units based on the minimally clinically important difference for diarrhea was observed; with clinically relevant change in 69% of patients on migalastat compared to 11% of patients on placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1894723" linkType="Reference"&gt;1894723&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In September 2017, further clinical data were presented at the 13th ICIEM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Statistically significant reduction in kidney interstitial capillary GL-3 from months 0 to 6 (p =Â 0.008) and months 6 to 12 was observed (p = 0.014). The annualized rate of change in estimated GFR (CKD-EPI) over 24 months was -0.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 [&lt;ulink linkID="1966184" linkType="Reference"&gt;1966184&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further clinical data were presented at the same conference. Response in Kidney interstitial capillary globotriaosylceramide (KIC GL-3) and/or Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale diarrhea sub-domain (GSRS-D) when either or both were elevated at baseline was observed in 83% patients treated with migalastat compared with placebo (33%) [&lt;ulink linkID="1966162" linkType="Reference"&gt;1966162&lt;/ulink&gt;]. InÂ February 2019, further results from a post hoc analysis were presented at the 15th Annual Lysosomal Disease Network WORLD Symposium in Orlando, FL. The difference in median change in PTC-GL-3 inclusions were -0.91 and -0.02 in the migalastat and placebo groups, respectively. A &amp;gt;/= 50% reduction in PTC GL-3 was achieved by 78 and 25% of patients in the migalastat and placebo groups, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2118998" linkType="Reference"&gt;2118998&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2009, Amicus and Shire planned to discuss the design of a phase III trial with the EMA. The trial would evaluate the safety and efficacy of migalastat versus standard-of-care enzyme replacement therapies (ERT) in Fabry patients [&lt;ulink linkID="975932" linkType="Reference"&gt;975932&lt;/ulink&gt;&lt;ulink&gt;&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2009, the company was evaluating the EMA's feedback regarding the trial. The primary endpoint  would assess renal function   [&lt;ulink linkID="1020055" linkType="Reference"&gt;1020055&lt;/ulink&gt;].  The  18-month, randomized, open-label study (&lt;ulink linkID="71196" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01218659&lt;/ulink&gt;; Study 012; FAB-AT1001-012; ATTRACT) was to compare migalastat to ERT in patients (n = 68) with Fabry disease who were receiving ERT (agalsidase) and had a mutation responsive to migalastat. Patients would either receive the drug or remain on ERT. The trial began in September 2011 in Europe, the US, Japan and South America [&lt;ulink linkID="2119266" linkType="Reference"&gt;2119266&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="1067672" linkType="Reference"&gt;1067672&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2011, the first patient was dosed. At that time, the trial was expected to enroll 50 patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1221828" linkType="Reference"&gt;1221828&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By October 2012, target enrollment had been achieved, with 56 patients enrolled in the study [&lt;ulink linkID="1333664" linkType="Reference"&gt;1333664&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In June 2014, after advice from the European regulator, renal function outcomes in the entire data set had been specified for analysis, taking into consideration the low recruitment of the trial due to the orphan nature of the disease [&lt;ulink linkID="1573835" linkType="Reference"&gt;1573835&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2014, 18-month data from the trial were reported, showing that migalastat met the co-primary endpoints of mean annualized changes in eGFR and measured (iohexol) GFR (mGFR). At 18 months, the change in eGFR and mGFR was comparable between migalastat and ERT. Plasma levels of the lyso-Gb3 biomarker for Fabry disease remained low and stable in patients with amenable mutations who switched to migalastat from ERT at 18 months. In patients (n = 48) with GLP HEK-amenable mutations who completed trial, 96% decided to continue with the 12-month treatment extension [&lt;ulink linkID="1586507" linkType="Reference"&gt;1586507&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In November 2014, further  data were presented at the ASN Kidney Week 2014 in Philadelphia, PA. At 18 months, the mean annualized estimated eGFR and mGFR rates were -0.40 and -1.03 ml/min/1.73 m2/year  and -4.35 and -3.24 ml/min/1.73 m2/year in the migalastat and ERT groups, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1614699" linkType="Reference"&gt;1614699&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1612696" linkType="Reference"&gt;1612696&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2015, cardiac data from were reported. A decrease in LVMi, a measure of cardiac hypertrophy, was demonstrated after treatment with the drug at 18 months in patients who switched from ERT with amenable mutations [&lt;ulink linkID="1625146" linkType="Reference"&gt;1625146&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the same month, similar data were presnted at 33rd Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="1628530" linkType="Reference"&gt;1628530&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2015, pre-specified secondary and tertiary endpoint data on patient-reported outcome measures of pain and quality-of-life were reported at the 11th Annual Lysosomal Disease Network  WORLD Symposium 2015 in Orlando, FL. The Brief Pain Inventory and Short Form 36 measures showed that pain and quality-of-life remained stable in patients swapping from ERT to  migalastat [&lt;ulink linkID="1632804" linkType="Reference"&gt;1632804&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further clinical data were also presented at the same conference.   Event frequency observed for a composite endpoint (renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular events) with migalastat was 29% when compared with 44% for ERT. In patients who switched to migalastat, LVMi was decreased from baseline to month 18 (mean = -6.6 g/m2). Migalastat was generally safe and well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1635100" linkType="Reference"&gt;1635100&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2016, similar data were presented at the WORLD Symposium 2016 held at in San Diego, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="1739324" linkType="Reference"&gt;1739324&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2016, further data were presented at the SSIEM 2016 Annual Symposium in Rome, Italy. Migalastat and ERT exhibited comparable effects on renal function [&lt;ulink linkID="1894722" linkType="Reference"&gt;1894722&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2016, similar data were published [&lt;ulink linkID="1873474" linkType="Reference"&gt;1873474&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1874222" linkType="Reference"&gt;1874222&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2017, further data were presented at the 13th Annual Lysosomal Disease Network WORLD Symposium in San Diego, CA. Over 18 months with migalastat and ERT, renal or cardiac events were experienced by 24 and 33%, and 6 and 17% of patients, respectively. Only one cerebrovascular event was reported in the ERT group [&lt;ulink linkID="1901611" linkType="Reference"&gt;1901611&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data data from a retrospective subanalysis of patients with the amenable GLA mutation p.N215S (n = 11) were presented at the same conference. In patients treated with migalastat, mean changes in baseline levels of glomerular filtration rate by chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration, measured GFR using iohexol clearance, left ventricular mass index and lyso-Gb3 at month 18 was 0.50, -1.03, -4.80 and 0.05, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1901593" linkType="Reference"&gt;1901593&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2017, further clinical data were presented at the 13th ICIEM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. During the 18-month controlled period of ATTRACT, the annualized means of eGFR for migalastst (-0.40) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT -1.03) were found to be comparable. The annualized rates of change in eGFRÂ were in the range of 60 to &amp;lt; 90 ml/min/1.73m2 for migalastst and ERT were 0.2 and 7.3 ml/min/1.73m2 [&lt;ulink linkID="1966184" linkType="Reference"&gt;1966184&lt;/ulink&gt;]. InÂ February 2019, further clinical data from ATTRACT and extension study were presented at the 15th Annual Lysosomal Disease Network WORLD Symposium in Orlando, FL. The median obotriaosylsphingosine (lyso Gb3) level was found to be lower in females (5.8 nM.min) compared with males (10.5 nM.min) when combined both randomized groups [&lt;ulink linkID="2118950" linkType="Reference"&gt;2118950&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further post-hos analysis results  of patients with GLA amendable mutations (n = 47) were presented at the same conference.  In patients who switched to migalastat from agalsidase beta (n = 11) or agalsidase alfa (n = 20), stayed on agalsidase beta (n = 5) or agalsidase alfa (n= 11), the mean annual rates of EGFR (CKD-EPI) changes were -1.0, -0.9, 2.2 Â and -4.4 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively; mean reductions in LVMi from baseline compared with patients who stayed on the ERT were -14.1, -4.4, -3.5 and -2.5 g/m2, respectively. In all four groups, plasma levels of lyso-Gb3 remained stable. Switching to migalastat led to increase in WBC alfa-Gal A activity (tested in males only)  [&lt;ulink linkID="2118991" linkType="Reference"&gt;2118991&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2008, the company completed an end of phase II meeting with the FDA. The agency indicated the  data from the completed phase II studies supported the start of phase III trials, and that the FDA was not opposed to the use of a surrogate primary endpoint [&lt;ulink linkID="931265" linkType="Reference"&gt;931265&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In October 2011, data from an open-label, phase II trial (study 204) in nine female patients were presented at the 61st ASHG Annual Meeting in Montreal, Canada. Subjects received oral 50, 150, or 250 mg of migalastat every other day for 12 weeks followed by a 36-week extension period. There were no serious adverse events and no treatment-limiting toxicities. After 48 weeks of treatment, patients receiving 150 or 250 mg doses who also had a GLA mutation were found to have the earliest and most significant decreases in GL-3 [&lt;ulink linkID="1235524" linkType="Reference"&gt;1235524&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2007, a phase II non-randomized, open-label, uncontrolled, single-group, extension study (&lt;ulink linkID="6889" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00526071&lt;/ulink&gt;; FAB-CL-205; Study '205) was initiated in the US, Australia, Brazil, France and the UK, for subjects with Fabry disease  (n = 23) who had completed a previous phase II AT-1001 trial. The main objective was to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics in the subject population. The study was expected to complete in December 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="868001" linkType="Reference"&gt;868001&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2009, results from the extension study were presented at American College of Medical Genetics 2009 Annual Meeting in Tampa, FL. Ten patients had been treated for two years and four for more than three years. The drug was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Patients had maintained elevated levels of a-Gal A and showed reduced levels of kidney GL-3 [&lt;ulink linkID="995870" linkType="Reference"&gt;995870&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2010, 22 of the patients enrolled were still receiving treatment. Of those patients, 14 had been receiving treatment for more than two years and eight patients had been receiving treatment for more than three years. In a subset of patients eligible for a phase III trial, stabilization of renal function, as measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and a trend in improved proteinuria were observed [&lt;ulink linkID="1067672" linkType="Reference"&gt;1067672&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2010, further data were presented at the Lysosomal Disease Network World Symposium in Miami, FL. Preliminary data showed that the estimated GFR (eGFR) rate remained stable for two to three years for all patients and the average annual rate of change in eGFR in patients identified as responders to migalastat, excluding hyperfiltrators, was +2.0 ml/min/1.73 m2. Additionally, trends of reduced proteinuria were observed in responders [&lt;ulink linkID="1074813" linkType="Reference"&gt;1074813&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2010, 19 patients were continuing treatment in the extension study [&lt;ulink linkID="1096637" linkType="Reference"&gt;1096637&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2011, further data were presented at the Lysosomal Disease Network World Symposium in Las Vegas, Nevada; 17 patients were continuing with treatment in the ongoing extension study. A total of 15 patients had been treated with migalastat for &amp;gt; 3 years and 7 patients had been treated with for &amp;gt; 4 years. Data demonstrated that eGFR remained stable for up to 3 to 4 years for all patients and the average annual rate of change in eGFR in patients identified as responders to the drug, excluding hyperfiltrators, was +1.6 ml/min/1.73m2. Â Reduced 24-h urine protein levels (a mean 21% and median 34% reduction from baseline) were observed in responders. The drug was well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events observed. Common adverse events included headache, arthralgia, diarrhea and fatigue [&lt;ulink linkID="1168595" linkType="Reference"&gt;1168595&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1168068" linkType="Reference"&gt;1168068&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2011, at total of 17 patients continued to receive migalastat [&lt;ulink linkID="1268930" linkType="Reference"&gt;1268930&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2012, further data were presented at the American Society of Nephrology annual meeting in San Diego, CA. In 8 patients who had paired kidney biopsies from baseline, the median decrease in interstitial capillary GL-3 was 78% in patients (n = 5) with genetic mutations amenable to migalastat in a cell-based assay, and the median increase in interstitial capillary GL-3 was 114% in those (n = 3) with non-amenable mutations. In the 17 patients who continued on migalastat, the median treatment duration was 5.2 years. At that time, final analysis was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1337587" linkType="Reference"&gt;1337587&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2012, further data were presented  at the 62nd Annual Meeting of American Society  of Human Genetics in San Francisco, CA. Patients received 150 mg migalastat qod following dose escalation to 500 mg due to lack of additional benefits in increasing alpha-galactosidase A activity or decreasingÂ  urine globotriaosylceramide levels. Overall, migalastat at 150 mg and 250 mg doses was well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1384497" linkType="Reference"&gt;1384497&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2006, a global, multicenter, 12-week, randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics, phase II trial  (&lt;ulink linkID="6886" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00304512&lt;/ulink&gt;) began in 12 female patients with Fabry disease in  the US, Australia, Brazil, Canada and France. The study  consisted of a 4-week screening phase, a 12-week treatment phase that could be extended up to an additional 36 weeks, and a 2-week follow-up phase. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability of  migalastat.

Migalastat was safe and well-tolerated at all doses with no serious adverse events reported. An increase in a-Gal A, as measured in white blood cells, kidney, and skin, was observed in 24 patients. Patients with greater increases in a-Gal A levels had decreased kidney GL-3 levels. Renal and cardiac function results were also 'encouraging'. At  that time, the companies planned to meet with the FDA and the EMEA to discuss the design of a phase III trial [&lt;ulink linkID="862390" linkType="Reference"&gt;862390&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2006, the company began a  multicenter, 12-week, non-randomized, open-label, safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics, phase II trial  (&lt;ulink linkID="6885" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00283959&lt;/ulink&gt;) in eight patients with Fabry disease in Brazil and Australia.

In February 2012, data were reported from seven patients; five patients received 0.5 mg/kg of agalsidase beta (q4w) plus 150 mg migalastat and two patients received 1.0 mg/kg of agalsidase beta (q4w) plus 150 mg migalastat. Similar data were reported for plasma levels of active enzyme.Â In addition, active enzyme levels in skin biopsies taken on day 2 post-dose from all seven patients receiving the combination regimen were 1.1- to 18.9-fold higher after subtracting baseline activity than in patients on ERT alone, and on day 7 post-dose, active enzyme levels remained increased by up to 11.1-fold after subtracting baseline activity in five of the patients receiving the combination treatment compared with patients on ERT alone [&lt;ulink linkID="1268930" linkType="Reference"&gt;1268930&lt;/ulink&gt;].

The trial was completed in October 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1139469" linkType="Reference"&gt;1139469&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2012, data from, all 12 patients in the migalastat  150 mg dose group, of the 23-patient trial were presented at the American Society of Human Genetics 2012 Annual Meeting, in San Francisco, CA. Data demonstrated that migalastat 150 mg co-administered with two different doses of Fabrazyme, and one dose of Replagal, increased active enzyme levels in skin biopsy samples on day 2 and, to a lesser extent, on day 7 compared to each of the ERTs alone [&lt;ulink linkID="1339044" linkType="Reference"&gt;1339044&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In February 2013, further data were presented at the Lysosomal Disease Network WORLD Symposium in Orlando, FL, which demonstrated that both doses of migalastat (150 and 450 mg) co-administered with ERT increased enzyme activity compared with Fabrazyme and Replagal monotherapy. At that time, safety data were expected in 2Q13 [&lt;ulink linkID="1383143" linkType="Reference"&gt;1383143&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2012,  data from a mouse model of Fabry disease were to be presented at the SSIEM Symposium, to be held in  September  2012 in Birmingham, UK [&lt;ulink linkID="1318344" linkType="Reference"&gt;1318344&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2011, preclinical data were presented at the 61st ASHG Annual Meeting in Montreal, Canada.

Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by alpha-Gal A deficiency. Missense mutations in alpha-Gal A can lead to impaired folding, decreased enzyme stability and inefficient trafficking of the enzyme to the lysosome. A small-molecule inhibitor of alpha-Gal A, such as migalastat, can act as a chaperone, aiding the passage of the maturing enzyme to the lysosomes and so increasing the release of alpha-Gal A. Migalastat is a potent inhibitor of alpha-Gal A in vitro, but was associated with increased levels and activity of the mutated and wild-type enzyme in cellular systems and in animal models of Fabry disease. Increased enzyme activity was observed in phase I trials in healthy volunteers, and phase II trials in patients with Fabry disease suggested improvement or stabilization of some symptoms. Phase III trials were ongoing at the time of publication. Migalastat could potentially be the first small-molecule oral treatment for Fabry disease, potentially cheaper and with better tissue penetration than the current standard of care, enzyme replacement therapy.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Fabry disease (OMIM#301500) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by alpha galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) deficiency [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212257"&gt;1212257&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Human alpha-Gal A is a homodimeric glycoprotein, which is synthesized as a 429-amino acid precursor and cleaved after the first 31 amino acids to produce a mature protein [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1200874"&gt;1200874&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Classic Fabry disease is an orphan disease with a reported incidence of 1 in ~ 117,000 individuals [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="501470"&gt;501470&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It can affect individuals of all ethnic groups. Heterozygous females have ~ 50% of enzyme activity by virtue of having one normal X chromosome. However, they often exhibit clinical manifestations of the disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212264"&gt;1212264&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212266"&gt;1212266&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Nearly 600 mutations have been reported to cause clinically significant manifestations and ~ 60% of all mutations are missense [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1220560"&gt;1220560&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These missense mutations are distributed across all seven exons of the GLA gene and can lead to reduced catabolic activity of the enzyme in a variety of ways, including impaired folding, decreased enzyme stability and inefficient trafficking to the lysosome. Misfolded alpha-Gal A enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells leads to cellular stress, which may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Increasing numbers of males and females with clinically significant disease caused by missense mutations associated with residual enzyme activity are being reported [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212258"&gt;1212258&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The biochemical hallmark of Fabry disease is substrate accumulation in the lysosomes of tissues; this ultimately leads to cellular and organ damage, which leads to diverse clinical manifestations. Fabry disease typically manifests during childhood and adolescence, and common early symptoms include neuropathic pain, hypohidrosis, skin rash, gastrointestinal problems and sensory abnormalities [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212352"&gt;1212352&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Progression of the condition typically occurs and organ damage is frequently observed in early adulthood [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212258"&gt;1212258&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The main causes of death among patients with Fabry disease are kidney disease (leading to end-stage renal failure), cardiac disease (leading to arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and cardiac valve disease) and cerebrovascular disease (leading to stroke and transient ischaemic attack) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212404"&gt;1212404&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212407"&gt;1212407&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Screening by measurement of alpha-Gal A activity or detection of alpha-Gal A mutations in defined populations has led to detection of significant numbers of patients. Several studies have reported that Fabry disease can present as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212410"&gt;1212410&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212416"&gt;1212416&lt;/ulink&gt;], renal failure [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212440"&gt;1212440&lt;/ulink&gt;] or cryptogenic stroke [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212441"&gt;1212441&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212443"&gt;1212443&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212451"&gt;1212451&lt;/ulink&gt;] among young adults. Thus, up to 5% of males with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will have previously undetected Fabry disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212410"&gt;1212410&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212416"&gt;1212416&lt;/ulink&gt;], and up to 5% of males and 3% of females under the age of 55 years presenting with cryptogenic stroke will have a mutation in the alpha-Gal A gene[&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212441"&gt;1212441&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212443"&gt;1212443&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212451"&gt;1212451&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The precise incidence of such 'late-onset' or organ-specific forms of Fabry disease is disputed. Nevertheless, it is clear that the incidence of these attenuated forms of the disease is manifold higher than classic Fabry disease. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Newborn screening studies in Italy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212456"&gt;1212456&lt;/ulink&gt;] and Taiwan [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212457"&gt;1212457&lt;/ulink&gt;] have reported an incidence of Fabry disease as high as 1 in 3000 to 5000 male infants. In the Italian study, 11 of 12 identified mutations were predicted to result in minimal clinical manifestations; however, 1 of the 12 mutations had been previously reported in association with clinical disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212456"&gt;1212456&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These mutations underlie the late-onset or organ-specific variants of the disease - mutations that lead to misfolding of the protein and are precisely the type of mutation that may be amenable to chaperone therapy. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The current treatment approach for Fabry disease is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which has been available for Fabry disease since 2001 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212468"&gt;1212468&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Two preparations have been approved in Europe and one of these has also been approved by the FDA in the US. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14366"&gt;Agalsidase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt; (not available in the US) is manufactured using a gene activation methodology and the alpha-Gal A protein is manufactured within human fibroblasts. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;Agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt; (available in the US) is a recombinant alpha-Gal A protein made in CHO cells. The two products are licensed at different doses - &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14366"&gt;agalsidase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt; has been approved at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg q2w and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt; has been licensed at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg q2w. The two products are generally considered to have broadly equivalent activity and clinical efficacy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212468"&gt;1212468&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Their effectiveness has been demonstrated by randomized clinical trials, long-term extensions of the trials, large numbers of clinical case series and long-term analyses of registry data [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="414669"&gt;414669&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="772157"&gt;772157&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="809236"&gt;809236&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1200867"&gt;1200867&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212577"&gt;1212577&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;However, it is well recognized that ERT has limitations [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212578"&gt;1212578&lt;/ulink&gt;]. ERT is suboptimal in accessing some tissues, including the kidney, myocardium and CNS, and the efficacy of ERT is reduced in patients with irreversible tissue damage. ERT is also administered intravenously, which imposes stress and inconvenience on patients, and its expense means it may not be cost-effective [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212580"&gt;1212580&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1220619"&gt;1220619&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, infusions of ERT typically lead to antibody production, which may be a significant impediment to its long-term efficacy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="857057"&gt;857057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. There has also recently been a shortage of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt;, which arose because of contamination by viruses in the manufacturer's production facility [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1114005"&gt;1114005&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1141406"&gt;1141406&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1220623"&gt;1220623&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Shortage of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt; led to increasing numbers of patients using doses of the drug that were lower than the licensed dose [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212582"&gt;1212582&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Evidence is emerging that while some patients may be stable at these lower doses, many are not. Reports to regulatory agencies have suggested an increasing number of adverse events among patients receiving lower than recommended doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt;. Significant numbers of patients have switched from &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt; to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14366"&gt;agalsidase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1220623"&gt;1220623&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The outcome for these patients is not yet known. It is therefore clear that there is a significant unmet need within the Fabry community for new treatments. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The use of small-molecule, pharmacological agents at low doses (sub-inhibitory intracellular concentrations), known as chemical chaperones, for the treatment of Fabry disease was first proposed by Jian-Qiang Fan and colleagues at the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20631"&gt;Mount Sinai School of Medicine&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212260"&gt;1212260&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212263"&gt;1212263&lt;/ulink&gt;]. They studied alpha-Gal A activity in lymphoblasts from patients with Fabry disease bearing R301Q or Q279E mutations and demonstrated that administration of the imino sugar 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin increased enzyme activity. Dr Fan then went on to found &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1003633"&gt;Amicus Therapeutics&lt;/ulink&gt;, which, at the time of publication, was developing a formulation of 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin as migalastat as a potential oral therapy for Fabry disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221828"&gt;1221828&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1003633"&gt;Amicus&lt;/ulink&gt; has been codeveloping migalastat with &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="21948"&gt;GlaxoSmithKline&lt;/ulink&gt; since October 2010 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1143012"&gt;1143012&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Migalastat could be the first small-molecule oral treatment for Fabry disease, potentially cheaper and with better tissue penetration than ERT. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;According to granted US patent &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3117199"&gt;US-06274597&lt;/ulink&gt;, which is assigned to the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20631"&gt;Mount Sinai School of Medicine&lt;/ulink&gt; and names Dr Fan as an inventor, a series of plant-derived alkaloids were tested to enhance lysosomal alpha-Gal A activity. The compound 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (later known as migalastat) demonstrated the most potent in vitro inhibition of alpha-Gal A with an IC50 of 4.7 nM. An IC50 of 2.9 microM was displayed by 3,4-diepi-alpha-homonojirimycin, but the other tested derivatives were only mild inhibitors (IC50 values ranged from 0.25 to 2.6 mM). Surprisingly, both migalastat and 3,4-diepi-alpha-homonojirimycin (at 10 microM) enhanced alpha-Gal A activity in COS-1 cells transfected with the R301Q mutant alpha-Gal A gene (an atypical Fabry variant), with migalastat having the greatest effect (enzyme activity ~ 700 U/mg). This effect was also observed with some of the other alkaloids at greater concentrations. Further analysis of migalastat in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts with R301Q or Q279E genotypes demonstrated that enzyme activity was increased to ~ 50% of that observed in normal cells.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In their discussion of the data in US patent &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3117199"&gt;US-06274597&lt;/ulink&gt;, the inventors hypothesized why an inhibitor of the enzyme might increase the enzyme activity in cellular systems. Some mutations in alpha-Gal A can cause incorrect folding of the enzyme protein, although the catalytic center is unaffected. The incorrect folding prevents the protein from progressing through the 'quality control systems' and being released from the cell. However, binding of the inhibitor to the catalytic center could lead to the folding assuming the normal (or sufficiently normal) conformation and being passed through the checkpoints to mature in the Golgi. Once in a lysosome for transport to the cell surface, the inhibitor dissociates from the catalytic site of the enzyme in the acidity of the lysosome (see [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1214056"&gt;1214056&lt;/ulink&gt;] for pH-dependent binding of 1-deoxynojirimycin), yet the conformation of the enzyme remains stable in the acidic conditions. Thus, the inhibitor is acting as a chaperone for the enzyme.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Similar information on the SAR of migalastat and its derivatives was reported by Fan and colleagues in a 2000 article [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1183759"&gt;1183759&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Migalastat was the most potent inhibitor of alpha-Gal A with an IC50 of 0.04 microM, although IC50 values of 0.21, 4.3 and 16 microM were also reported for alpha-galacto-homonojirimycin, alpha-allo-homonojirimycin and beta-1-C-butyl-deoxygalactonojirimycin, respectively, suggesting these derivatives were also effective inhibitors. Meaningful inhibition was not observed with N-alkylated derivatives of migalastat, or derivatives deoxygenated at the C2 position or epimerized at the C3 position. Incubation of Fabry (R301Q) lymphoblasts with 100 microM of migalastat, alpha-galacto-homonojirimycin, alpha-allo-homonojirimycin or beta-1-C-butyl-deoxygalactonojirimycin increased alpha-Gal A activity by 14- (ie, to ~ 49% of healthy cells), 5.2-, 2.4- and 2.3-fold, respectively; no or limited increases were observed with other derivatives [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1183759"&gt;1183759&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Migalastat can be synthesized by several methods starting from different sugar analogs [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221146"&gt;1221146&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221151"&gt;1221151&lt;/ulink&gt;] [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193440"&gt;1193440&lt;/ulink&gt;], or from cyclic aminals [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221155"&gt;1221155&lt;/ulink&gt;] or 1-deoxynojirimycin [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221160"&gt;1221160&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The first preparation of 1-deoxynojirimycin was published in 1967 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221165"&gt;1221165&lt;/ulink&gt;], while the first synthesis of migalastat was published in 1980 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221146"&gt;1221146&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The most recent, simple and stereoselective method starting from commercially available materials was based on efficient reductive coupling of a vinylzinc nucleophile to an alpha-chiral aldehyde and SN-2-type displacement by an amino group [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193440"&gt;1193440&lt;/ulink&gt;]. 3-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-2,2-dimethyloxazolidine-4(S)-carboxaldehyde (Garner's aldehyde) was added to a solution of a vinylzinc nucleophile generated in situ from O-silyl-protected 2-propyn-1-ol and zirconocene hydrochloride in dichloromethane followed by transmetallation with diethylzinc at -40 to 0degC to give the corresponding allylic alcohol with &amp;gt; 20 syn selectivity and 73 to 78% yield. Benzyl protection of the free hydroxyl group, followed by stereoselective dihydroxylation (syn:anti ratio &amp;gt; 12:1) of the double bond under Upjohn conditions and desilylation gave tert-butyl 4(S)-[1(R)-(benzyloxy)-2(S),3(R),4-trihydroxybutyl]-3-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2,2-dimethyloxazolidine-4(S)-carboxylate. Selective mesylation of the primary hydroxy group of the trihydroxybutyl moiety was carried out using mesyl chloride and 2,4,6-collidine in dichloromethane at 0 to 2degC. The oxazolidine of the resultant compound was ring-opened with HCl (6 M) in methanol to give 2-amino-3-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-6-O-(mesyl)-D-galactitol hydrochloride, which was treated with Hunig's base in methanol and debenzylated under palladium-carbon catalyzed hydrogenation in methanolic HCl to give migalastat in 35% overall yield and &amp;gt; 99% enantiomeric excess (starting from Garner's aldehyde) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193440"&gt;1193440&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Syntheses of various intermediates were reported in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3420044"&gt;WO-2006133447&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3420351"&gt;WO-2006133448&lt;/ulink&gt;. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vitro&lt;/subtitle&gt;Migalastat is a competitive inhibitor of alpha-Gal A. It binds the active site of alpha-Gal A and improves folding, stability and lysosomal trafficking of alpha-Gal A in cultured cells from males affected by Fabry disease. Fan et al [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193328"&gt;1193328&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212260"&gt;1212260&lt;/ulink&gt;] and Yam et al [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193333"&gt;1193333&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193334"&gt;1193334&lt;/ulink&gt;] demonstrated that the lysosomal fractions of cells derived from Fabry cell lines and incubated with migalastat had greater alpha-Gal A activity than untreated cells. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the increased alpha-Gal A activity colocalized with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193333"&gt;1193333&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193334"&gt;1193334&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Benjamin et al [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1047414"&gt;1047414&lt;/ulink&gt;] substantially extended these observations by examining the effects of migalastat incubation on alpha-Gal A levels in cells derived directly from male Fabry patients. Lymphoblast lines were obtained from male Fabry patients representing 75 different missense mutations, one insertion and one splice-site mutation. Following exposure to migalastat (5 nM to 100 microM), concentration-dependent increases in alpha-Gal A levels were observed, with responses differing in magnitude and durability after migalastat washout depending on the precise mutation. Overall, 49 of the 75 alpha-Gal A mutant forms responded, including 53% of the tested mutants associated with the classic Fabry phenotype and 90% of mutants associated with the late-onset phenotype. Interestingly, a concentration-dependent increase in wild-type alpha-Gal A levels in response to migalastat incubation was also observed. No responses were observed in the cell lines bearing the insertion or splicing mutation. Of the 27 responsive classic alpha-Gal A mutant forms, 11 displayed a migalastat EC50 value of &amp;lt;/= 50 microM, which was considered an easily achievable plasma concentration after oral administration. Furthermore, the elevated levels of the alpha-Gal A substrate globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) observed in fibroblasts from patients with Fabry disease declined when cells were incubated with migalastat, indicating that the measured increases in cellular alpha-Gal A levels translated into increased lysosomal alpha-Gal A function [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1047414"&gt;1047414&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar effects were also reported by Ishii et al [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193358"&gt;1193358&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The methodology described in these studies by Benjamin et al formed the basis of a comprehensive in vitro screening approach to identify mutant forms of alpha-Gal A that may respond to migalastat and ultimately to identify Fabry patients who may benefit from pharmacological chaperone therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="886049"&gt;886049&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1047413"&gt;1047413&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212600"&gt;1212600&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221011"&gt;1221011&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221795"&gt;1221795&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A cell-based assay was developed in cultured HEK293 cells to identify mutant forms of alpha-Gal A that were responsive to migalastat. HEK293 cells were transfected using plasmids carrying 81 different Fabry disease-causing missense mutations, including two double mutations, which had been identified in patients enrolled in the phase II clinical trials of migalastat. Alpha-Gal A activity increased concentration-dependently in response to migalastat (50 nM to 1 mM) in 49 of the 81 mutants; 16 of the responsive mutants had migalastat EC50 values &amp;lt;/= 10 microM. Importantly, the responses of alpha-Gal A mutants expressed in HEK293 cells were comparable with the mutant responses observed in male Fabry patient-derived lymphoblasts [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221011"&gt;1221011&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vivo&lt;/subtitle&gt;Fan et al [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212260"&gt;1212260&lt;/ulink&gt;] assessed the administration of migalastat (0.05 or 0.5 mM in the drinking water; ~ 3 or 30 mg/kg/day) for 1 week to transgenic mice expressing a mutated alpha-Gal A &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="23924"&gt;transgene&lt;/ulink&gt; (R301Q). Increased alpha-Gal A levels and increased enzymatic activity in cellular lysates was observed, including lysates from the heart (4.8- and 18-fold from baseline at the respective doses), kidney (2.0- and 2.8-fold, respectively), spleen (3.1- and 7.1-fold, respectively) and liver (1.7- and 1.8-fold, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212260"&gt;1212260&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Accumulation of GL-3 was also reduced in the heart of treated animals compared with untreated animals, confirming that the increased levels of alpha-Gal A were translated into increased activity of the enzyme [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193331"&gt;1193331&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were also reported by Ishii et al [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193383"&gt;1193383&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Khanna and colleagues [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="886124"&gt;886124&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160327"&gt;1160327&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160328"&gt;1160328&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1171413"&gt;1171413&lt;/ulink&gt;] extended these observations in a new transgenic mouse model of Fabry disease (hR301Q alpha-Gal A), which utilized the human GLA gene promoter. Immunohistochemical demonstration of GL-3 accumulation was observed in the fibroblasts of skin, heart and kidney from 12-week-old mice. Oral administration of migalastat (3, 10, 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks) to these mice led to dose-dependent increases in alpha-Gal A levels and increased enzymatic activity. Reduced GL-3 levels were also reported in the skin, heart, kidney and plasma, with maximal reductions of 69 (at 30 mg/kg/day), 72 (at 300 mg/kg/day), 30 (at 100 mg/kg/day) and 48% (at 100 mg/kg/day), respectively. Interestingly, the tissue half-life of migalastat was much shorter than the observed duration of elevated alpha-Gal A activity. This led to the hypothesis that a 4-day period of migalastat administration could be used to provide a period of enhanced protein stabilization and improved intracellular trafficking of lysosomes. This would be followed by a 3-day period of migalastat withdrawal that would allow dissociation and clearance of migalastat from the tissues and so promote alpha-Gal A activity and substrate turnover. Testing of this migalastat regimen (at 300 mg/kg/day po for four cycles) in 8-week-old hR301Q transgenic mice demonstrated a greater level of GL-3 reduction in the skin, heart and kidney (82, 87 and 46%, respectively) than daily administration, and utilized ~ 60% less drug. Similar results were also obtained in aged (24-week-old) hR301Q transgenic mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160328"&gt;1160328&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Following the coadministration of migalastat and ERT to rodents, the circulating half-life of ERT was increased. In alpha-Gal A knockout mice, coadministration increased the tissue enzyme activity, resulting in decreased GL-3 accumulation compared with ERT alone [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221799"&gt;1221799&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;In patient-derived lymphoblasts in vitro, migalastat at a concentration of 10 microM was specific for alpha-Gal A, and demonstrated minimal effects on the activity of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and beta-galactosidase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1047414"&gt;1047414&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a preliminary toxicity study in transgenic mice, migalastat (150 mg/kg/day for 1 week) was not associated with any obvious sign of toxicity. Appearance of mice was normal, and body weight and major tissue weights increased as normal. Long-term dosing of migalastat (3 mg/kg/day for 20 weeks) to transgenic mice was similarly well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212260"&gt;1212260&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In rats, migalastat was tolerated at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160327"&gt;1160327&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a similar set of experiments, migalastat (30 mg/kg/day po) was administered to transgenic mice for 9 weeks. Body and organ weights increased over the study period, but did not significantly differ from an untreated control group at any time point. Transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase levels did not indicate any signs of cardiac or hepatic toxicity, and there were no histological differences in the heart, kidney, spleen, liver or lungs between treated and untreated mice. White blood cell counts and leukocyte profiles were not altered. A similar toxicity profile was reported in mice administered migalastat (3 mg/kg/day po) for 20 weeks. Furthermore, in mice administered 3 mg/kg/day of oral migalastat for 2 years, there were no reported abnormalities in appearance, growth or fertility, and the lifespan of treated mice appeared to be the same as for untreated mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1193383"&gt;1193383&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Migalastat has been rigorously evaluated in a full range of toxicity studies in animals. Single-dose studies were conducted in four Sprague-Dawley rats (AA05300/ITR5879; 1500 mg/kg) and two Beagle dogs (AA05301/ITR600; 500 mg/kg). There were no deaths and no signs of toxicity were observed during a 3-day observation period or at necropsy. Migalastat was also well tolerated in repeat-dose studies in rats at doses of 100, 500 and 1500 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Chronic toxicity has also been assessed in a 6-month study, with a minimal to slight increase in the number of lymphoid follicles observed at spleen microscopy. Similar studies in cynomolgus monkeys have also demonstrated no evidence of toxicity. Genotoxicity studies did not demonstrate evidence of mutagenicity and a dose of up to 300 mg/kg/day had no teratogenic potential in rabbits [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1226641"&gt;1226641&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism and pharmacokinetics&lt;/subtitle&gt;Migalastat (100 mg/kg/day) was administered in the drinking water of 8-week-old hR301Q transgenic mice for 4 weeks. Significant levels of migalastat were measured in the plasma (2.4 microM on the last day of dosing), skin (1.8 microM), heart (1.1 microM), kidney (7.5 microM) and brain (data not reported), indicating that migalastat was orally available and had a broad tissue distribution profile. Importantly, tissue concentrations were greater than the Ki value for alpha-Gal A. Migalastat levels decreased by ~ 90% 1 day after dosing, yet alpha-Gal A activity remained significantly increased compared with untreated controls to at least 7 days after the end of dosing (p &amp;lt; 0.05) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160328"&gt;1160328&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a separate study in C57BL/6 mice, migalastat (100 mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage. Migalastat rapidly achieved high plasma levels, with Cmax and Tmax values of 170 microM and 0.5 h, respectively. Plasma levels declined over time, reaching 30 nM at 24 h after dosing. Migalastat also had a 0.5-h Tmax in the heart, skin and kidney, reaching concentrations of 40, 75 and 920 microM, respectively. Again, concentrations declined over time, decreasing to 320, 130 and 360 nM, respectively, at 24 h after dosing [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160327"&gt;1160327&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The tissue half-life in skin, heart and kidney was 2 to 3 h [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160328"&gt;1160328&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Importantly, migalastat was also detected in the brain tissue, indicating that it is able to cross the blood-brain barrier; Cmax was 3.6 microM and Tmax was 1 h. Unlike other tissues, these levels were sustained for up to 8 h, declining to 600 nM by 24 h after dosing [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160327"&gt;1160327&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a first-in-man phase I clinical trial (FAB-CL-102), healthy volunteers (n = 16) received migalastat (50 or 150 mg po, bid) or placebo (3:1 ratio) for 7 days. There was no evidence of accumulation over the 7 days of dosing, with Cmax values of 2.3 and 11.3 microM in the 50- and 150-mg dose groups, respectively, on day 1, and 3.9 and 10.8 microM, respectively, on day 7. Peak concentrations occurred ~ 3 h after dosing and the half-life was ~ 2.5 h. The proportion of migalastat excreted in the urine over the 12-h post-dosing period in the 50-mg dose group was 16% on day 1 increasing to 48% on day 7, and in the 150-mg dose group was 42% increasing to 60% [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3420032"&gt;WO-2006133098&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Steady-state was reached by day 5 of dosing and accumulation ratios were 1.2 to 1.8 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221791"&gt;1221791&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Combined data from five phase I clinical trials, including FAB-CL-102, have also been reported. These trials assessed single-dose migalastat (25 to 2000 mg po; FAB-CL-101 and FAB-CL-104), single-dose migalastat (100 mg) administered after fasting or after a high fat meal (FAB-CL-103 and AT1001-010), and multiple-dose migalastat (50 or 150 mg bid for 7 days; FAB-CL-102) in a total of 139 healthy volunteers. Plasma levels of migalastat increased dose-proportionally up to a dose of 1250 mg, after which no increases were observed. Bioavailability was &gt;/= 50%, but was reduced by 40% when migalastat was administered with food. Unchanged migalastat was excreted in the urine, with an elimination half-life of ~ 4 h [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221791"&gt;1221791&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;Following twice-daily doses of migalastat (50 or 150 mg po) in a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical trial (FAB-CL-102) in healthy volunteers (n = 16; 6 per active treatment group and 4 on placebo), a dose-dependent trend of increased white blood cell alpha-Gal A enzymatic activity was observed [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160327"&gt;1160327&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Following the 50-mg dose, normalized white blood cell alpha-Gal A enzymatic activity increased to 120, 130 and 145% of pre-dose levels at 100, 150 and 336 h post-first-dose, respectively. Following the 150-mg dose, normalized white blood cell alpha-Gal A enzymatic activity increased to 150, 185 and 185% of pre-dose levels at 100, 150 and 336 h post-first-dose, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="886124"&gt;886124&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160327"&gt;1160327&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221791"&gt;1221791&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3420032"&gt;WO-2006133098&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Efficacy data from the four additional phase I clinical trials reported in the Metabolism and pharmacokinetics section were not available at the time of publication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;Data from four phase II, open-label clinical trials in patients with Fabry disease have been reported [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1047412"&gt;1047412&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1160329"&gt;1160329&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1171402"&gt;1171402&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1171412"&gt;1171412&lt;/ulink&gt;]. FAB-CL-201 (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="6892"&gt;NCT00214500&lt;/ulink&gt;) was a multicenter, 12-week, ascending-dose trial in nine patients in the US. Three dose levels of daily oral migalastat were evaluated. Six additional patients participated in an initial in vitro screening but were not enrolled. FAB-CL-202 (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="6885"&gt;NCT00283959&lt;/ulink&gt;) enrolled four patients in Australia and Brazil at a migalastat dose level of 150 mg (po, q2d) for 12 weeks. FAB-CL-203 (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="6884"&gt;NCT00283933&lt;/ulink&gt;) was a 24-week trial that enrolled five patients in Canada, France and the UK at a single dose level. FAB-CL-204 (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="6886"&gt;NCT00304512&lt;/ulink&gt;) was a multicenter trial that enrolled nine female patients at migalastat dose levels of 50, 150 and 250 mg (po, q2d) for 12 weeks. A total of 27 patients were enrolled across the four trials, although only 26 completed the 12- or 24-week treatment periods. Of these, 23 patients enrolled in the long-term extension trial FAB-CL-205 (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="6889"&gt;NCT00526071&lt;/ulink&gt;). At the time the data were reported (February 2011), 22 patients had received migalastat for &amp;gt; 3 years with 7 of these patients having received it for &amp;gt; 4 years; 17 patients continued to receive migalastat therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1171412"&gt;1171412&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Migalastat-responsive mutations were present in 14 of 17 males and 5 of 9 females who completed the initial treatment periods. The estimated glomerular filtration rate in treated patients remained stable for up to 4 years (mean annual rate of change: +0.9 ml/min/1.73 m2). A trend toward a reduction in 24-h urine protein was also observed in male patients with responsive mutations. The ongoing dose is at 150 mg (q2d) as differing dose regimens did not demonstrate benefit over this regime. Responsive patients had increased alpha-Gal A activity in leukocytes, skin and kidney, and renal biopsies demonstrated a reduced GL-3 accumulation and reduced levels of proteinuria in some responsive patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1171412"&gt;1171412&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The shortage of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt; offered increased opportunities for trials in patients receiving attenuated doses. A phase IIa, open-label, multicenter clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="70177"&gt;NCT01196871&lt;/ulink&gt;, AT1001-013) of migalastat coadministered with ERT opened in 2011. Male patients (expected n = 18) with Fabry disease on a stable (even if attenuated) dose of ERT would be enrolled to receive a single oral dose of migalastat 2 h before their regular ERT infusion [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1171410"&gt;1171410&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patient recruitment was ongoing at the time of publication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;Patients were being enrolled in two phase III, randomized, multicenter clinical trials at the time of publication. The FACETS trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="58148"&gt;NCT00925301&lt;/ulink&gt;, AT1001-011) would recruit ERT-naive (or ERT free for &gt;/= 6 months) patients (expected n = 60) with Fabry disease and a confirmed migalastat-responsive GLA mutation. Patients would be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to double-blind migalastat (po, q2d) or placebo for 6 months. All patients would then receive open-label migalastat for an additional 6 months followed by an optional 13-month open-label extension phase. The ATTRACT study (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="71196"&gt;NCT01218659&lt;/ulink&gt;, AT1001-012) would recruit patients (expected n = 50) with Fabry disease and a confirmed migalastat-responsive GLA mutation who were receiving a stable dose of ERT. Patients would be randomized to either oral migalastat (n ~ 30) or to remain with their prescribed ERT (n ~ 20) for 18 months of open-label treatment. Patients would then be invited to enroll in a 12-month extension phase where all participants would be treated with migalastat.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Additionally, &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1003633"&gt;Amicus&lt;/ulink&gt; has developed a new in vitro assay [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221011"&gt;1221011&lt;/ulink&gt;], applicable to males and females and primarily based on the GLA mutation, which correlates well with the PBMC test.

Although 23 serious adverse events were reported, all were considered as unrelated or unlikely to be related to migalastat therapy. These 23 serious adverse events were cardiac-related (n = 8), general (n = 5), procedure-related (n = 4), CNS (n = 3), respiratory (n = 1), endocrine (n = 1) and musculoskeletal (n = 1). One patient discontinued therapy after experiencing ventricular fibrillation and a stroke, both of which were considered disease-related. Adverse events that were reported as probably related to migalastat included fatigue, mild epigastric pain and esophageal reflux, and one patient reported arthralgia and myalgia when the dose was escalated to 500 mg, but these symptoms resolved when the dose was lowered.

At the time of publication, &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3573816"&gt;WO-2007137072&lt;/ulink&gt; had been granted in the US as &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3611640"&gt;US-07851143&lt;/ulink&gt; with protection until May 2027 and was pending grant in Europe as &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3752651"&gt;EP-02024745&lt;/ulink&gt;; &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3695103"&gt;WO-2008121826&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA5348110"&gt;WO-2009102895&lt;/ulink&gt; were also pending grant both in Europe (&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA5482043"&gt;EP-02142197&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA6261025"&gt;EP-02252313&lt;/ulink&gt;, respectively) and in the US (&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA5586708"&gt;US-20100113517&lt;/ulink&gt;, and &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA6487778"&gt;US-20110152319&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA6562539"&gt;US-20110212996&lt;/ulink&gt;, respectively).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1003633"&gt;Amicus&lt;/ulink&gt; has also filed &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA6268059"&gt;WO-2010138608&lt;/ulink&gt; relating to the use of pharmacological chaperones, including migalastat, to improve the manufacture and purification of lysosomal enzymes in cell culture systems; at the time of publication, the corresponding US equivalents (&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA6388544"&gt;US-20110070643&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA6480192"&gt;US-20110143419&lt;/ulink&gt;) were pending grant, and the European equivalents had not been filed.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;ERT has been available since 2001 to treat Fabry disease and there is considerable treatment experience in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. Two issues are clear to most clinicians who prescribe ERT. Firstly, even in the absence of formal proof, ERT is beneficial in not only improving the quality of life of patients with Fabry disease, but also in reducing the rate of deterioration of organ function. Secondly, it is also clear that ERT is only modestly effective. Studies have suggested that the uptake of both &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14366"&gt;agalsidase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt; to tissues is suboptimal [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="792398"&gt;792398&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Postmortem studies have shown that the enzyme is able to access certain cellular types, but other diseased cells, such as in the myocardium, kidney and CNS, are not accessed by ERT [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212605"&gt;1212605&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that patients receiving ERT can develop stroke [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212404"&gt;1212404&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212407"&gt;1212407&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212605"&gt;1212605&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although ERT is capable of reducing left ventricular size, possibly improving contractility, and may have an impact on arrhythmias [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212606"&gt;1212606&lt;/ulink&gt;], it is abundantly clear that patients with advanced cardiac disease (ie, patients demonstrating gadolinium enhancement on MRI scans [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212614"&gt;1212614&lt;/ulink&gt;] or with any evidence of fibrosis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="505162"&gt;505162&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212621"&gt;1212621&lt;/ulink&gt;]) do not benefit from ERT. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;However, ERT appears to reduce the natural rate of decline of renal function in patients with Fabry disease. An early study suggested that male patients with Fabry disease experienced a decline of as much as 10 to 12 mm/min/year in glomerular filtration rate [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212625"&gt;1212625&lt;/ulink&gt;], although most experts believe that the true rate of decline in the modern era, even without ERT, is less. Patients receiving ERT experience rates of decline of ~ 1 to 5 mm/min/year, with the extent of pre-existing renal damage at the time at which ERT was initiated being the major determinant of future loss of function [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1012482"&gt;1012482&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It is also clear that patients who have significant proteinuria prior to the initiation of ERT respond less well [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1012482"&gt;1012482&lt;/ulink&gt;]; furthermore, it has been difficult to demonstrate an impact of ERT on proteinuria. Treatment targets for Fabry disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212641"&gt;1212641&lt;/ulink&gt;] contrast sharply with those for other lysosomal disorders, such as Gaucher disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1068570"&gt;1068570&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212646"&gt;1212646&lt;/ulink&gt;]; ERT appears capable of reversing most of the major manifestations of Gaucher disease, including organ enlargement and abnormal blood counts [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212651"&gt;1212651&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It is noteworthy, however, that even in Gaucher disease, ERT cannot access certain tissues, such as the CNS, and has only a modest effect on bone manifestations of the disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212665"&gt;1212665&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Achievable targets for ERT in Fabry disease are much more modest, indicating a need for newer and better therapeutic approaches. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Fabry disease is potentially severe. A 2009 study [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212407"&gt;1212407&lt;/ulink&gt;] estimated life expectancy of Fabry disease in males to be 58.2 years (compared with 74.7 years among the general population) and 75.4 years for females (compared with 80 years). These figures are modestly better than estimates from a decade earlier [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="500991"&gt;500991&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212670"&gt;1212670&lt;/ulink&gt;] and there is uncontrolled evidence that ERT has had an impact on life expectancy. It is clear, however, that patients receiving ERT can nevertheless die prematurely. One approach for improving treatment outcome in Fabry disease is to commence treatment prior to the development of organ damage. Guidelines for treatment initiation in children, females and males are fairly consistent in most developed countries, and most symptomatic individuals can access therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1222827"&gt;1222827&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, most clinicians do not advocate treating asymptomatic individuals. Once stabilized, patients are likely to continue receiving treatment for many years; indeed, the patients who were enrolled in the original ERT trials have now been on treatment for more than 10 years. There is clearly a need for oral alternatives, particularly if they are cheaper than ERT. The recent shortage of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt; also emphasizes the need for alternative treatments. Most patients who were on &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt; were only able to access reduced doses, although it is apparent that many patients remained stable even on a reduced dose. However, data reported to registries, regulatory authorities and in studies confirm that some patients did not remain stable, and there were increased numbers of adverse events in patients on reduced doses. As large numbers of patients switched treatment from &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt; to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14366"&gt;agalsidase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt;, there were initially some concerns about supply constraints for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14366"&gt;agalsidase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212582"&gt;1212582&lt;/ulink&gt;], although thankfully sufficient &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14366"&gt;agalsidase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt; has been available to meet worldwide demand. The shortage of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt; has highlighted the need for alternative therapies, particularly in the US where &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14366"&gt;agalsidase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt; is not available as a licensed treatment.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;It has become clear over the last 5 years that Fabry disease is much more prevalent than previously suspected [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212456"&gt;1212456&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212457"&gt;1212457&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients who have been identified through targeted screening (eg, the patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, stroke and renal impairment) typically have organ damage and are candidates for ERT [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212440"&gt;1212440&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Family members are also frequently diagnosed once the index case is characterized. Patients with late-onset disease typically have missense mutations. The majority of patients with missense mutations identified in screening (eg, neonatal screening programs) have mutations that may well not be associated with disease manifestations until later in life [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212456"&gt;1212456&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;There is clearly a large and growing demand for effective treatments for Fabry disease, particularly for patients with missense mutations, with oral treatments being preferred by patients. Home therapy for ERT has been established in several countries and the evidence indicates that patients prefer home treatment, although oral therapies still remain much easier to administer. An important limitation of ERT is the development of antibodies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212582"&gt;1212582&lt;/ulink&gt;] and although antibody formation appears to be more frequent with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11205"&gt;agalsidase beta&lt;/ulink&gt; than &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14366"&gt;agalsidase alfa&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212468"&gt;1212468&lt;/ulink&gt;], it is clearly an issue with both products. The long-term importance of these antibodies is currently not clear; however, the antibodies are neutralizing in vitro and have been associated with reduced clearance of substrate in some studies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="857057"&gt;857057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Oral chaperone treatments may be effective in patients who are antibody-positive, as small-molecule therapy is not associated with issues of antibody formation. Furthermore, a combination of chaperone therapy with ERT may be theoretically beneficial in ERT patients who are antibody-positive. A combination of a chaperone with ERT may also be advantageous in patients who are receiving lower than optimal doses of ERT because of, for example, difficulties in manufacturing the enzyme. These combination approaches are currently being explored in clinical trials (see &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="70177"&gt;NCT01196871&lt;/ulink&gt;). &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Pharmacological chaperone therapy is attractive but major hurdles remain. The correct dose of the drug and the most appropriate dosing schedule has not yet been identified. Complex dosing schedules will be associated with reduced compliance even when the drug is oral. The nature of the mechanism and action of these drugs is such that a degree of enzyme inhibition is quite likely. This was a significant problem in Pompe disease and was perhaps associated with early termination of a phase II trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1003633"&gt;Amicus&lt;/ulink&gt;'s &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="55422"&gt;duvoglustat&lt;/ulink&gt; (1-deoxynojirimycin), an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212677"&gt;1212677&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A phase II trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1003633"&gt;Amicus&lt;/ulink&gt;'s &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="53976"&gt;afegostat&lt;/ulink&gt; (isofagomine) chaperone therapy in 18 patients with Gaucher disease showed no clinical benefit; several patients demonstrated an increase in enzyme activity but there was no decrease in plasma concentrations of substrate [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="993080"&gt;993080&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The clinical activity of pharmacological chaperone therapy remains therefore an unknown. A striking in vitro benefit is not always translated into a striking in vivo benefit for patients. The phase II trials with migalastat demonstrate that patients can tolerate therapy for long periods and these patients seem to have stabilization of renal function; however, data from controlled comparative trials are lacking. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Chaperone therapy is mutation-dependent and patients in the trials have typically undergone screening studies. It will be important to see if the modest benefits revealed in these trials can be duplicated in patients who are recruited without molecular screening. Predicting response to chaperone therapy may be possible on the basis of knowledge of the mutation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212682"&gt;1212682&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1221011"&gt;1221011&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Whereas safety and side effects were an issue with regard to chaperone therapy for Pompe and Gaucher disease, migalastat appears much better tolerated. Chaperone therapy in combination with ERT may increase efficacy of ERT and overcome some of the perceived difficulties with regard to the efficacy of chaperone therapy alone. The results of ongoing trials and studies are eagerly awaited. Other ancillary approaches to treatment of Fabry disease, such as the use of calcium antagonists, are also promising [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212685"&gt;1212685&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The emphasis in managing patients with Fabry disease is to optimize their care within a multidisciplinary setting. Concomitant medication for cardiac and renal damage, prophylaxis against stroke, adequate treatment of hypertension, and early introduction of ACE inhibitors have all been advocated as ways of improving outcome in Fabry disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1212687"&gt;1212687&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It may be that other concomitant treatment approaches should include use of other therapeutics, including pharmacological chaperones; the results of the trials in progress will be crucial in assessing the value of these new approaches. &lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="1003633">Amicus Therapeutics Inc</Company><Country
