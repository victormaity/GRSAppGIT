In May 2019, negative initial data were reported. The company was planning to pursue higher dose and longer duration studies; at that time, the company was planning an expanded clinical development program for Xanamem in cognitive impairment in mood disorders and schizophrenia [&lt;ulink linkID="2151634" linkType="Reference"&gt;2151634&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2017,  &lt;ulink linkID="1067532" linkType="Company"&gt;Bio-Link&lt;/ulink&gt;, on behalf of Actinogen, was seeking to outlicense the program [&lt;ulink linkID="1928119" linkType="Reference"&gt;1928119&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2018, a target occupancy study that aims to accurately demonstrate the effect different doses of Xanamem has on the 11B-HSD1 enzyme in the human brain was underway and results were anticipated in the second quarter of 2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="2058228" linkType="Reference"&gt;2058228&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2018, the company planned to initiate a higher dose safety study and additional safety toxicology studies in the fourth quarter of 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="2058228" linkType="Reference"&gt;2058228&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2016, a phase II trial to evaluate Xanamem in patients with diabetes cognitive impairment was planned to be initiated in late 2016 with first subject and last subject recruitment planned in the first quarter of 2017 and second quarter of 2018, respectively. At that time, top-line results were expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1758613" linkType="Reference"&gt;1758613&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2017, the company planned to begin the trial in 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1921785" linkType="Reference"&gt;1921785&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2014, Actinogen was planning a phase IIa proof-of-concept study  [&lt;ulink linkID="1588052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1588052&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2015, the trial was planned to be initiated in early 2016, in Australia, US, UK and Europe [&lt;ulink linkID="1637110" linkType="Reference"&gt;1637110&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2016, the 12-week, pivotal, double-blind, , randomized, parallel assigned,  placebo-controlled phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="257696" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02727699&lt;/ulink&gt;; ACW0002; XanADu) was to begin  in Australia, the UK and the US to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Xanamem (35 mg bid) in patients (expected n = 174) with mild dementia due to probable Alzheimer's disease. At that time, the trial was expected to end in August 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1745395" linkType="Reference"&gt;1745395&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1751107" linkType="Reference"&gt;1751107&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2016, last subject was expected to be recruited in the first quarter of 2018 and top-line data were expected in the third quarter of 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1758613" linkType="Reference"&gt;1758613&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2016, enrollment was to begin  in the second half of 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1770456" linkType="Reference"&gt;1770456&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2016, the FDA requested the company to resolve questions around potential safety surveillance of the drug before patients be treated in the US by the end of 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1802859" linkType="Reference"&gt;1802859&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2016, patient enrollment  was planned in early 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1882831" linkType="Reference"&gt;1882831&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2017, the first patients were to be treated in the early second quarter of 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1899149" linkType="Reference"&gt;1899149&lt;/ulink&gt;]; later that month, the company was planning to enroll 174 patients in the trial. At that time, recruitment was expected to be completed by October 2018 and data from the trial were expected in early 2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="1904225" linkType="Reference"&gt;1904225&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later in February 2017, regulatory approval from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) was expected  over the coming weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="1904225" linkType="Reference"&gt;1904225&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2017, the regulatory approval was received  from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to initiate patient recruitment in the  trial. The first patient was expected to  treat in Australia, the US and the UK in the second quarter of 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1906963" linkType="Reference"&gt;1906963&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later that month, the trial was initiated in the US and Australia. The trial was to complete in May 2019   [&lt;ulink linkID="1751107" linkType="Reference"&gt;1751107&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2017, first patient was expected to receive treatment 'within weeks'. At that time, topline data from the trial were expected in early 2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="1921785" linkType="Reference"&gt;1921785&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2017, first patient was enrolled in the trial in Australia. At that time,   final patient  recruitment was expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 and   top-line data were expected in the first quarter of  2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="1928147" linkType="Reference"&gt;1928147&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2017, first patient was enrolled in the trial in the UK [&lt;ulink linkID="1953996" linkType="Reference"&gt;1953996&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2018, 74 patients had been enrolled in the  trial and 30 patients have completed the 12-week trial; at that time, full data were expected in the second quarter of 2019  [&lt;ulink linkID="2006772" linkType="Reference"&gt;2006772&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2018, the trial enrolled 87 of 174 patients and expected to recruit final patient in the fourth quarter of 2018. Further, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) would commence an interim analysis once the 50th evaluable patient had completed 12-week treatment period and 4-week follow up phase. Results from the analysis were expected in late May or early June of 2018. At that time, interim analysis and topline data were expected in the second quarter of 2018 and April/May 2019, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2016136" linkType="Reference"&gt;2016136&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2018, the DSMB completed its planned interim analysis on the first 50 evaluable patients who have fully completed the study and an additional 37 patients' safety data, and recommended to continue the trial without modification [&lt;ulink linkID="2037051" linkType="Reference"&gt;2037051&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018,  five new study sites for XanADu were opened in the US. The new sites were in addition to the existing twenty trial sites in the US, Australia and the UK, that had enrolled 117 patients. At that time,    patient enrolment was expected to complete before the end of 2018 and  top-line results were expected by the second quarter of 2019  [&lt;ulink linkID="2051992" linkType="Reference"&gt;2051992&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2018, 75% of the enrollment was completed, with 131 of the 174 patients enrolled [&lt;ulink linkID="2063442" linkType="Reference"&gt;2063442&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2018, the DSMB reviewed safety data from 125 patients and reaffirmed its recommendation to  continue the phase II trial without modification. The  DSMB was to hold a third periodic review, and likely the last meeting, before the end of 2018. At that time, a total of 136 patients have been enrolled (78% of the planned 174) and  recruitment was to be finalized before the end of 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="2066093" linkType="Reference"&gt;2066093&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2018, 145 patients (83%) were enrolled out of the 174 target, with the final patient expected to be enrolled before the end of the year [&lt;ulink linkID="2071453" linkType="Reference"&gt;2071453&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2018, a total of 169 of 174 patients were enrolled; enrollment of patients was expected to close on  October 26, 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="2085756" linkType="Reference"&gt;2085756&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2018, final patient was enrolled and a  total of 186 patients were enrolled. At that time, trial completion and results were expected in the second quarter 2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="2097665" linkType="Reference"&gt;2097665&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2019, initial data were reported from the study of 10 mg Xanamem. Data demonstrated that, 10mg daily dose showed safety and the ability to effectively inhibit cortisol production, as demonstrated by the expected increase in related hormones, including ACTH, where as showed inadequate efficacy in improving cognition in mild Alzheimer's disease. There were no statistical differences between Xanamem 10 mg and placebo in primary and secondary endpoint measures. At that time, further analysis of the XanADu data was expected and the company was planning to pursue higher dose and longer duration studies [&lt;ulink linkID="2151634" linkType="Reference"&gt;2151634&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2016, data were to be presented at the Clinical Trials in Alzheimer's Disease meeting in San Diego, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="1882831" linkType="Reference"&gt;1882831&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By August 2014, approval  had been obtained to initiate a multiple ascending-dose phase Ib study in healthy subjects which  the company was planning to initiate the trial in early 2015 [&lt;ulink linkID="1608802" linkType="Reference"&gt;1608802&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1588052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1588052&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1634265" linkType="Reference"&gt;1634265&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2015, the three-part, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study {&lt;ulink linkID="247168" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02616445&lt;/ulink&gt;; ACW0001) was initiated in Australia in healthy subjects (expected n = 40). By November 2015, the trial had completed [&lt;ulink linkID="1637110" linkType="Reference"&gt;1637110&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2016, data were expected to be presented at the 2016 AAIC in July 2016, in Toronto, Canada. Data demonstrated that following oral administration, Xanamem effectively crossed the blood-brain-barrier and got to the brain [&lt;ulink linkID="1776912" linkType="Reference"&gt;1776912&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2016, data were presented at the 2016 AAIC in July 2016 in Toronto, Canada. Following multiple doses plasma drug levels detected were dose-proportional with t1/2 values from 10 to 14h. At doses &amp;gt;/= 10 mg. CSF Xanamem concentrations determined in 4 healthy volunteers were 7.5 to 11.9% of total plasma levels. Xanamem Cmax values in CSF were substantially higher than the cellular IC50 [&lt;ulink linkID="1782083" linkType="Reference"&gt;1782083&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1783593" linkType="Reference"&gt;1783593&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1783590" linkType="Reference"&gt;1783590&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1784695" linkType="Reference"&gt;1784695&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By March 2012, clinical trials with Xanamem were expected in late 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1271108" linkType="Reference"&gt;1271108&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in January 2013, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I study (&lt;ulink linkID="105224" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01770886&lt;/ulink&gt;) to assess safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Xanamem  was initiated in healthy subjects (expected n = 48) in the UK;  the trial was completed in July 2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1358641" linkType="Reference"&gt;1358641&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2013, first clinical data were presented at the 17th RSC-SCI Medicinal Chemistry Symposium in Cambridge, UK. Xanamem was well tolerated with moderate clearance and an improved AUC value when compared to AMG-221. No adverse effects were seen at 25 mg [&lt;ulink linkID="1479375" linkType="Reference"&gt;1479375&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1588052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1588052&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2017, the first results were published. Data demonstrated that Xanamem was safe and well tolerated and data confirmed its brain penetrating properties of the drug that it reached the brain at concentrations predicted to inhibit excess cortisol production in 	the brain [&lt;ulink linkID="1899149" linkType="Reference"&gt;1899149&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1899351" linkType="Reference"&gt;1899351&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2019, an interventional, randomized, parallel-assignment, placebo-controlled, single-blinded, central-reader-blinded, dose-escalation, phase I study (&lt;ulink linkID="369124" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT03830762&lt;/ulink&gt;; ACW0003; XanaHES) was initiated to assess the the safety and tolerability of Xanamem in healthy adult subjects (expected n = 84). At that time, the trial was expected to complete in December 2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="2123553" linkType="Reference"&gt;2123553&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2019, first  participant was dosed in the trial [&lt;ulink linkID="2123469" linkType="Reference"&gt;2123469&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2019, initial data from the study with 20 mg and 30 mg were expected by the end of June 2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="2151634" linkType="Reference"&gt;2151634&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2016, clinical  data were expected to be presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in July 2016, in Toronto, Canada.
