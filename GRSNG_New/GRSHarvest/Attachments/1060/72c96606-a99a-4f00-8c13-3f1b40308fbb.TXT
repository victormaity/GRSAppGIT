Gavilimomab entered phase II/III in December 1999 [&lt;ulink linkID="349649" linkType="reference"&gt;349649&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2003, SangStat disclosed data from the phase II/III study showing that gavilimomab did not meet its primary endpoint; at this time, the companies did not plan further development of the compound [&lt;ulink linkID="479125" linkType="reference"&gt;479125&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; &lt;ulink linkID="28926" linkType="Company"&gt;The FDA&lt;/ulink&gt; granted gavilimomab Orphan Drug status for the treatment of GvHD in November 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="391883" linkType="reference"&gt;391883&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In 2000, launch was anticipated for early 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="386808" linkType="reference"&gt;386808&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="436419" linkType="reference"&gt;436419&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A multicenter, randomized and controlled phase II/III trial comparing standard therapies and gavilimomab for the treatment of steroid-resistant GvHD was initiated in December 1999; the primary endpoint of the study, which was expected to last 18 to 24 months, was survival [&lt;ulink linkID="349649" linkType="reference"&gt;349649&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Results from a previous trial confirmed that gavilimomab is an effective therapy for the treatment of hormone-refractory acute GvHD [&lt;ulink linkID="350687" linkType="reference"&gt;350687&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By January 2001, over one third of the patients (35) had been enrolled in the study [&lt;ulink linkID="396591" linkType="reference"&gt;396591&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2002, enrollment in the phase II/III trial was complete, with 92 evaluable patients [&lt;ulink linkID="457999" linkType="reference"&gt;457999&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2003, SangStat disclosed data from the phase II/III study showing that the survival rate in patients with acute steroid-resistant GvHD was similar to Atgam (anti-Thymocyte globulin; qv), the control arm [&lt;ulink linkID="479125" linkType="reference"&gt;479125&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2001, SangStat published results from a phase II study of gavilimomab in allogeneic transplant recipients with steroid-resistant GvHD. According to the trial protocol, 27 patients in the dose-finding portion of the trial received gavilimomab 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mg/kg per day, with an additional 32 patients dosed at 0.2 or 0.15 mg/kg per day. Treatment was started an average of 47 days post-transplantation, with drug infusions given over 2-h periods daily for 7 consecutive days, followed by a maintenance regimen of two infusions per week for 2 weeks, for a total of 11 infusions in 3 weeks. Of the 51 patients receiving at least four infusions of the drug, 26 (51%) responded, with 13 showing complete responses as assessed using the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry Index. Of the 59 total patients enrolled in the trial, 26 (44%) were alive 6 months after the start of therapy. Of the 34 serious adverse events reported in the study, one case of liver failure was thought to be related to gavilimomab and six cases of myalgia were thought to be probably related [&lt;ulink linkID="424435" linkType="reference"&gt;424435&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Three of eight patients at the lowest dose responded, compared to 23 of 43 in the three highest dose groups [&lt;ulink linkID="463803" linkType="reference"&gt;463803&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In an earlier phase II trial, completed in the third quarter of 1999, 52% of patients receiving 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg gavilimomab survived at least 100 days following initiation of therapy, compared to 22% of patients receiving the presumed no effect dose of 0.01 mg/kg [&lt;ulink linkID="391883" linkType="reference"&gt;391883&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="397889" linkType="reference"&gt;397889&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 1998, the last of 27 patients completed treatment in the phase II trial of GvHD [&lt;ulink linkID="309471" linkType="reference"&gt;309471&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Results from phase II trials were presented at the 35th American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in May 1999. The results showed that, out of the 23 evaluable patients, 13 responded to the treatment, and 6 responded completely, not requiring further therapy [&lt;ulink linkID="325766" linkType="reference"&gt;325766&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 1998, Abgenix commenced a phase II trial of the antibody at eight clinical centers to confirm the results of previous phase II trials. The study was to involve 48 patients. Positive results and the full protocol of the trial were reported in February 1999 [&lt;ulink linkID="313592" linkType="reference"&gt;313592&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="273521" linkType="reference"&gt;273521&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2001, it was revealed that a trial in primary GvHD was planned for the first half of 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="420751" linkType="reference"&gt;420751&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;As of March 1997, gavilimomab was also to be evaluated in kidney and other organ transplant rejection indications [&lt;ulink linkID="240365" linkType="reference"&gt;240365&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, as of 2002, Abgenix was developing the antibody for GvHD only. As CBL-1, the drug had been tested in clinical trials for GvHD and prevention of kidney transplant and corneal transplant rejection by CV Cancer Center [&lt;ulink linkID="240365" linkType="reference"&gt;240365&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="463803" linkType="reference"&gt;463803&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Gavilimomab also has potential for the treatment of inflammation and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkID="273521" linkType="reference"&gt;273521&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a clinical trial conducted by the CV Cancer Center, gavilimomab was administered to ten patients with acute steroid-resistant GvHD. The overall response rate was 90%, with GvHD completely resolved in five patients and improved by at least two grades in four others. The antibody was well tolerated and did not exacerbate post-transplant immunodeficiency. In another study involving 43 patients who developed GvHD after kidney transplant, gavilimomab was effective at both reversing the first rejection and preventing recurrence of rejection. It was shown to be safe with no serious adverse events reported [&lt;ulink linkID="240365" linkType="reference"&gt;240365&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2000, SangStat and Abgenix entered into a global codevelopment supply and license agreement for gavilimomab [&lt;ulink linkID="378352" linkType="reference"&gt;378352&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This agreement included the rights to follow-up products, such as a fully human anti-CD147 antibody [&lt;ulink linkID="420751" linkType="reference"&gt;420751&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary></DevelopmentProfile><ExpertReview>&lt;para&gt;Kai von Appen MD, Schwerpunkt Nephrologie Medische Klinikum, Klinikum Grosshadern, Munich, Germany&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;October 30 1998&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;ABX-CBL (CBL-1) is a murine monoclonal antibody. Its cytotoxic activity is directed against certain activated T-cells, natural killer cells and a subpopulation of monocytes [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245112"&gt;245112&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The original antibody was discovered by Dr Ronald Billing from the CV Cancer Center [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="240365"&gt;240365&lt;/ulink&gt;] during the early 1980s.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Antilymphocyte antibodies are used in organ and bone marrow transplantation to avoid or reverse immunological responses, such as acute rejection or graft versus host disease (GVHD). Polyclonal antibodies, which have been produced by immunization for more than 20 years in different animal species (eg horse, rabbit), vary in efficacy, concentration and composition from lot to lot. Therefore, monoclonal antibodies such as CBL-1 or OKT-3 were synthesized to deliver defined doses of homogeneously targeted substances to patients after transplantation. Clinical efficacy was proven for CBL-1 in patients after bone marrow transplantation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245083"&gt;245083&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245086"&gt;245086&lt;/ulink&gt;] and kidney transplantation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245110"&gt;245110&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245095"&gt;245095&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245106"&gt;245106&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Phase II studies are currently underway [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="273521"&gt;273521&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="274650"&gt;274650&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;The antibody, CBL-1, was first synthesized by R Billing in a murine model. It is produced [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245106"&gt;245106&lt;/ulink&gt;] by a hybridoma immunized with CEM, a lymphoblastoid T ALL cell line [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245112"&gt;245112&lt;/ulink&gt;]. After synthesis in BALB/c mice the collected ascitic fluid is treated with ammonium sulfate [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245095"&gt;245095&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Laboratory tests are performed for pyrogen production, sterility, toxicity, and mouse antibody profile negativity.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The resulting monoclonal antibody (IgM) is specific to a blast cell antigen (MW 15 kDa) that is different to the transferrin receptor [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245095"&gt;245095&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The cytotoxic effects (cell lysis) of the antibody to blast cells and monocytes involves activation of the complement system.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Following iv administration, CBL-1 is bound to a cell membrane glycolipid antigen (MW 15 kDa), expressed on subpopulations of activated T- and B-cells, NK-cells and monocytes. The cytotoxic activity of CBL-1 does not result in lymphocytopenia [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245110"&gt;245110&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245106"&gt;245106&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Treatment schedules describe daily administration of 5 to 15 mg doses for 5 to 10 days [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245095"&gt;245095&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245106"&gt;245106&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245083"&gt;245083&lt;/ulink&gt;], ie a total dose of between 50 and 100 mg. Another approach uses once-weekly administration for 6 weeks, to suppress low level GVHD [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245083"&gt;245083&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Therefore, dosage regimens and treatment duration will be based on indication (eg reversal of rejection or GVHD), and the expected types of immunological reactions.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;The currently-available data do not include information about distribution volumes, half-lives and binding characteristics. The synthesis of human-anti-mouse antibodies after CBL-1 therapy was evaluated and described for a majority of treated patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245110"&gt;245110&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245090"&gt;245090&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;The antibody is described to be remarkably nontoxic [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245110"&gt;245110&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245106"&gt;245106&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245097"&gt;245097&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245090"&gt;245090&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Of 19 patients included into a study [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245110"&gt;245110&lt;/ulink&gt;], none developed fever, vomiting or any other side-effects, and no depleting effects on peripheral blood count could be found (no lympho- or monocytopenia, unchanged platelet count). Similarly, of 24 patients on CBL-1 antirejection treatment, none developed any signs of toxicity [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245106"&gt;245106&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;No data are currently available. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;As long ago as 1983 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245110"&gt;245110&lt;/ulink&gt;] and 1985 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245106"&gt;245106&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245095"&gt;245095&lt;/ulink&gt;], patients were reported to respond positively to CBL-1-antirejection therapy, following renal allograft transplantation. 11 Patients with related donor kidney graft and eight patients with cadaver grafts with an episode of acute rejection (in 15 cases steroid-resistant) received CBL-1- therapy for 9 days. In 17 of the 19 patients, the rejection could be successfully reversed [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245110"&gt;245110&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a follow-up study [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245106"&gt;245106&lt;/ulink&gt;], two years later, no further rejection occurred in the living donor group and only two mild rejection episodes and one severe non-reversible rejection were observed in the cadaveric group. 22 Additional patients received CBL-1 either in the case of acute rejection or prophylactically, and confirmed its high efficacy in reversing ongoing rejection, while there was no effect in preventing acute rejection episodes [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245106"&gt;245106&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a further study, 18 renal allograft recipients with steroid-resistant acute rejection were examined. All patients except two had previously been also treated with ATGAM without success. After CBL-1 administration over 9 days, 50% of rejection episodes were reversed. In patients with a serum creatinine level of less than 4 mg/dl, rejection was reversible in 67% of cases, in situations less than 7 days following transplantation reversal rate was 72%, and if more than 90 mg of the antibody was administered, the reversal rate was 75% [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245095"&gt;245095&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 1985, a clinical trial in four juvenile patients with newly diagnosed type I diabetes mellitus did not show any amelioration of the diabetic course after a seven-day course of daily treatment with CBL-1 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245097"&gt;245097&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Results of two studies in bone marrow transplantation have been published [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245083"&gt;245083&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245086"&gt;245086&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Administration of CBL-1 to ten patients with grade III or IV steroid-resistant GVHD resulted in complete remission in five cases and partial remission in four. In eight similarly classified patients from another center, CBL-1-therapy achieved complete remission in four cases and partial remission in three cases [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245086"&gt;245086&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A confirmatory phase II trial commenced in January 1998 in eight centers. 48 Patients will be included and first results are expected to be released by the end of 1998 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="273571"&gt;273571&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Data from the multicenter study are essential to characterize the therapeutic benefit, since immunosuppressive therapy has changed substantially since 1985, and the earlier reported results cannot be directly applied to the current situation in either bone marrow or kidney transplantation.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side-effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;In a study of eight patients after bone marrow transplantation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245086"&gt;245086&lt;/ulink&gt;], two patients had fever, chills, muscle pain and mild hypotension after CBL-1 administration, while CBL-1 in ten patients after bone marrow transplantation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245083"&gt;245083&lt;/ulink&gt;] produced side-effects in two patients (fever, chills, muscle pain, mild hypotension), 1 to 2 h after the initial dose.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Administration of CBL-1 to patients with kidney allograft rejection [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="245110"&gt;245110&lt;/ulink&gt;] resulted in anti-mouse antibody titers in 14 of 19 patients at 2 weeks after the start of the treatment. Detection of anti-mouse antibodies prior to CBL-1-administration is a contraindication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;CBL-1, as a monoclonal antibody, has proven clinical efficacy (reversal of GVHD in bone marrow transplantation and reversal of acute rejection after kidney allograft transplantation), lacks side-effects (compared to the cytokine release syndrome observed after OKT-3 administration) and shows a low rate of recurrent rejections. However, its murine origin (resulting in synthesis of mouse anti-human antibodies in the majority of patients) and the delay since the first clinical studies (during which time there have been significant developments in therapeutic strategies in organ and bone marrow transplantation) are potential problems. Nonetheless, Abgenix, in collaboration with Neugenesis, appears to be using its 'XenoMouse' system to develop an economic commercial-scale synthesis of CBL-1, which could result in a very competitive product [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="274650"&gt;274650&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Current approaches to targeted immunosuppression, as well as induction of specific tolerance, involve both chimeric and humanized antibodies to specific cell membrane antigens on lymphocytes (eg the IL-2 receptor).  Many targeted antibodies are available, including antibodies to CD2, CD3*, CD4*, CD8, CD11a*, CD25*, CD45RB, CDw52*. CD54*, HLA class I alpha 3 domain and the T-cell receptor alpha beta isotype (those marked with an asterisk have already been evaluated successfully in clinical studies). However, target structures for CBL-1 are different from classified antigen structures such as membrane receptors. This does not imply a lower efficacy in lymphocyte inhibition, but further clinical studies are needed to characterize the treatment benefit of CBL-1, its possible combinations with other immunosuppressive drugs, incidence of viral, bacterial and fungal infections, incidence of neoplasms following transplantation, and its effects on long-term transplant survival (ie immune modulation).&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="19651">SangStat Medical Corp</Company><Country id="US">US</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="DX"
