In May 2004, Chiron initiated a phase III trial of the drug in severe CAP [&lt;ulink linkID="539041" linkType="reference"&gt;539041&lt;/ulink&gt;]; In February 2007, Novartis expected the phase III trial to complete in March 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="793345" linkType="Reference"&gt;793345&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2008, filing was expected for 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="965240" linkType="Reference"&gt;965240&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, by January 2009, Novartis had terminated the development of tifacogin [&lt;ulink linkID="996385" linkType="Reference"&gt;996385&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The compound was previously being developed in collaboration with &lt;ulink linkID="18937" linkType="Company"&gt;Pharmacia&lt;/ulink&gt; (formerly &lt;ulink linkID="18362" linkType="Company"&gt;Searle&lt;/ulink&gt;, the pharmaceutical division of Monsanto, now Pfizer), for the potential treatment of thromboembolism and sepsis [&lt;ulink linkID="224098" linkType="reference"&gt;224098&lt;/ulink&gt;], and by March 2000, the drug had reached phase III trials [&lt;ulink linkID="349192" linkType="reference"&gt;349192&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, no development had been reported by Pharmacia since July 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="374505" linkType="reference"&gt;374505&lt;/ulink&gt;], and by March 2003, Chiron had discontinued development [&lt;ulink linkID="481460" linkType="reference"&gt;481460&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2003, Chiron restarted the program for CAP and acquired all of Pfizer's interests in tifacogin [&lt;ulink linkID="510820" linkType="reference"&gt;510820&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2008, the EMEA's Pediatric Committee adopted a positive opinion on a pediatric investigation plan for the drug for infectious diseases [&lt;ulink linkID="906243" linkType="Reference"&gt;906243&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;PNEUMONIA&lt;/subtitle&gt;In October 2003, Chiron was planning a phase III trial for tifacogin in patients with severe CAP [&lt;ulink linkID="510820" linkType="reference"&gt;510820&lt;/ulink&gt;], which began in May 2004. The study, called CAPTIVATE 008 (NCT00084071; CTFP561A2308), comprised three treatment arms: placebo, low-dose tifacogin and higher-dose tifacogin. The trial was expected to accrue 2100 patients at 200 centers in 16 countries worldwide. The primary endpoint of the study was reduction in mortality at 28 days. An interim analysis was planned for August 2005, with final results in the fourth quarter of 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="539041" linkType="reference"&gt;539041&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="547198" linkType="reference"&gt;547198&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2005, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended the continuation of the trial. The DMC made its recommendation following a planned interim analysis. At that time, enrollment was expected to be completed in the first half of 2007 and the trial  had been expanded to 19 countries [&lt;ulink linkID="641725" linkType="Reference"&gt;641725&lt;/ulink&gt;].  The study was still recruiting in February 2007 and was expected to complete in March 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="793345" linkType="Reference"&gt;793345&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2009, data from the trial were presented at the 19th ECCMID conference in Helsinki, Finland. Mortality was equivalent between placebo and the group receiving the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="1015116" linkType="Reference"&gt;1015116&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;THROMBOEMBOLISM&lt;/subtitle&gt;The compound was previously being developed in collaboration with Pharmacia (formerly Searle, the pharmaceutical division of Monsanto) [&lt;ulink linkID="224098" linkType="reference"&gt;224098&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Pharmacia and Chiron began phase III trials in March 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="349192" linkType="reference"&gt;349192&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="406208" linkType="reference"&gt;406208&lt;/ulink&gt;], and in July 2000, Pharmacia confirmed that development was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="374505" linkType="reference"&gt;374505&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no development has been reported by Pharmacia since that time. Both companies were previously developing tifacogin for the potential treatment of thromboembolism for which phase II trials were underway by January 1996 [&lt;ulink linkID="195065" linkType="reference"&gt;195065&lt;/ulink&gt;]; but in February 1999, Chiron confirmed that both companies had discontinued development for this indication [&lt;ulink linkID="315276" linkType="reference"&gt;315276&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2003, Chiron acquired all of Pfizer's interest in tifacogin, in return for which Pfizer was to receive royalties on any sales [&lt;ulink linkID="510820" linkType="reference"&gt;510820&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;SEPSIS&lt;/subtitle&gt;By March 2000, tifacogin was in phase III trials [&lt;ulink linkID="406208" linkType="reference"&gt;406208&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2001, following disappointing phase III trial results, Chiron planned to undertake a full review of the trial data and to subsequently make a decision regarding the future development of the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="430106" linkType="reference"&gt;430106&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="436184" linkType="reference"&gt;436184&lt;/ulink&gt;]; tifacogin continued to be listed on Chiron's pipeline in April 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="456332" linkType="reference"&gt;456332&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By March 2003, development of tifacogin had been discontinued [&lt;ulink linkID="481460" linkType="reference"&gt;481460&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2001, Chiron reported that results of its phase III trial, OPTIMIST, indicated that tifacogin did not meet the primary endpoint of reducing 28-day all-cause mortality. There were no safety issues identified in tifacogin-treated patients. At this time the company said it would undertake a full review of the data and subsequently decide on the future of the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="430106" linkType="reference"&gt;430106&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="436184" linkType="reference"&gt;436184&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 1999, based on encouraging data from a phase II, multicenter, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of tifacogin in 210 patients, plans for phase III trials were initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="349192" linkType="reference"&gt;349192&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2000, Chiron and Pharmacia initiated a large, multicenter phase III trial to evaluate the ability of tifacogin to improve survival in patients with sepsis. The trial was designed to assess 28-day all-cause mortality as its primary endpoint and a number of secondary endpoints [&lt;ulink linkID="406208" linkType="reference"&gt;406208&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the end of 2000, patient enrollment for the phase III trial was on track and results were expected in 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="406208" linkType="reference"&gt;406208&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By July 2001, Chiron expected to complete enrollment in the phase III trial by the end of 2001 and to present data in the first half of 2002. A formal interim study had not been planned at this time [&lt;ulink linkID="417045" linkType="reference"&gt;417045&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This trial was presumed to be TFP007 [&lt;ulink linkID="561951" linkType="Reference"&gt;561951&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 1994, preclinical data on tifacogin were presented. In preclinical studies, the compound showed a beneficial effect on the survival of baboons after a lethal iv infusion of E coli at doses of 2.7 and 7.4 mg/kg. The treated baboons also maintained lower plasma levels of interleukin-6 and thrombin-antithrombin [&lt;ulink linkID="224093" linkType="reference"&gt;224093&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Regulatory&gt;</value></Regulatory><AdditionalInformation><displayLabel>Additional Information</displayLabel><value>&lt;AdditionalInformation&gt;&lt;para&gt;TFPI is a naturally occurring factor, previously known as LACI (lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor), that acts at a late stage in the coagulation and inflammatory process, which are thought to be responsible for the organ failure and loss of blood pressure that often leads to death; TFPI binds to tissue factor, Factor VIIa and Xa proteins which have important roles in the sepsis disease process [&lt;ulink linkID="168141" linkType="reference"&gt;168141&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="168698" linkType="reference"&gt;168698&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="224093" linkType="reference"&gt;224093&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="406208" linkType="reference"&gt;406208&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="432740" linkType="reference"&gt;432740&lt;/ulink&gt;]. TFPI was first isolated from a human hepatoma cell in 1987 [&lt;ulink linkID="224120" linkType="reference"&gt;224120&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 1994, Chiron and Searle, following a period of independent research into the compound by both companies, entered into an agreement to collaborate on the development, manufacturing and marketing of tifacogin. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies granted each other licenses for the patents concerned with TFPI [&lt;ulink linkID="224098" linkType="reference"&gt;224098&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Recombinant TFPI was first disclosed by Searle in the associated patent, &lt;ulink linkID="IN2149050" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-05212091&lt;/ulink&gt;. Unlike natural TFPI, however, it possessed an N-terminal alanine and the expression method using E coli did not always yield entirely homologous protein. A method for expressing genuine TFPI in yeast is disclosed in Chiron's patent &lt;ulink linkID="IN2712342" linkType="Patent"&gt;WO-9604377&lt;/ulink&gt;. Patents for methods of treating sepsis with TFPI were claimed independently in two patents from Cetus Oncology (Chiron; &lt;ulink linkID="IN2183310" linkType="Patent"&gt;WO-9324143&lt;/ulink&gt;) and Searle (&lt;ulink linkID="IN2183535" linkType="Patent"&gt;WO-9325230&lt;/ulink&gt;).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;ulink linkID="26113" linkType="Company"&gt;Washington University&lt;/ulink&gt; holds two patents, &lt;ulink linkID="IN2254518" linkType="Patent"&gt;EP-00563023&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="IN2712163" linkType="Patent"&gt;WO-9604378&lt;/ulink&gt;, which claim the use of TFPI for the inhibition of microvascular thrombosis and reperfusion injury, respectively.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Analysts at Lehman Brothers predicted in December 2001 that there was a 50% probability of the drug making it to market, with peak sales potential of $500 million in 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="434768" linkType="reference"&gt;434768&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/AdditionalInformation&gt;</value></AdditionalInformation></DevelopmentProfile><ExpertReview>&lt;para&gt;Niv Sne, Hari Kumar Ondiveeran and Alison Fox-Robichaud, Regional Critical Care Program, &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="21238"&gt;McMaster University&lt;/ulink&gt;, Ontario, Canada&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Submission date: 3 December 2001&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Publication date: 7 January 2002&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Since the discovery of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) by Broze in 1987 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="224120"&gt;224120&lt;/ulink&gt;], TFPI has gained a great degree of attention as an innate and valuable anticoagulant protein. Initial studies concentrated on the role of TFPI as an anti-thrombotic agent in ischemia-reperfusion injury. Over the last decade, a greater understanding of the intimate relationship that exists between sepsis and coagulation has emerged [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432086"&gt;432086&lt;/ulink&gt;], raising the question of whether TFPI has a role in the management of sepsis. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8777"&gt;Tifacogin&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="27638"&gt;Pharmacia Corp&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15385"&gt;Chiron Corp&lt;/ulink&gt;), a recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor (rTFPI), has been evaluated recently in a phase III clinical trial to determine its potential role as an adjunct therapy in patients with sepsis.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;The native human TFPI protein is a 276-amino-acid, 42-kD protein with a highly negatively charged -NH terminus and a highly positively charged -COOH terminus [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432079"&gt;432079&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The use of in vivo and in vitro models of TFPI has demonstrated that three distinct pools of TFPI exist. The largest pool of TFPI is associated closely with the heparin-induced release from the microvascular endothelium, which comprises approximately 85% of the overall TFPI population [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432087"&gt;432087&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432088"&gt;432088&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432089"&gt;432089&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Platelets, macrophages, and activated human fibroblast comprise 3 to 5% of TFPI [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432090"&gt;432090&lt;/ulink&gt;], while in plasma (3 to 5%) TFPI exists in both free and lipoprotein-bound forms [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432092"&gt;432092&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432094"&gt;432094&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The TFPI protein consists of three tandem repeated Kunitz-type inhibitory domains. Initially, the second domain binds Factor Xa in a calcium-independent fashion, followed by the binding of the first domain to TF/VIIa [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432095"&gt;432095&lt;/ulink&gt;] in the presence of calcium [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432130"&gt;432130&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This leads to the formation of the TFPI/TF/VIIa/Xa complex. The carboxy tail of the TFPI facilitates the binding of TFPI to cell surfaces, lipoprotein, and glycosaminoglycans, serving, as a whole, as an inhibitor of the extrinsic pathway [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432132"&gt;432132&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432136"&gt;432136&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The functional significance of the third domain is not understood fully and is currently being investigated. The third domain is thought to act as a heparin binding site, which, in the presence of heparin, enhances the inhibitory effect of the TFPI complex [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432137"&gt;432137&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432138"&gt;432138&lt;/ulink&gt;]. On the other hand, lipoprotein (a) also binds to this site and inactivates TFPI [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432140"&gt;432140&lt;/ulink&gt;], and TFPI has been shown recently to correlate with cholesterol levels [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432142"&gt;432142&lt;/ulink&gt;], suggesting a role for this molecule in protection from atherosclerosis. In addition, Park and colleagues, in a series of in vitro studies, have shown that the third domain is also involved in binding endotoxin, thus preventing it from forming a complex with CD14, which is responsible for neutrophil stimulation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432144"&gt;432144&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This response was dose dependent, and the authors postulated that this might contribute to the potential benefit of this drug in sepsis.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;rTFPI in which an &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18030"&gt;alanine&lt;/ulink&gt; residue was inserted at the amino terminus [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432150"&gt;432150&lt;/ulink&gt;] was originally expressed in Escherichia coli (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18291"&gt;Monsanto Co&lt;/ulink&gt;; US-05212091), but it lacked consistency in replicating a homologous protein. Saccharomyces cerevisae is now being used to synthesize genuine rTFPI (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15385"&gt;Chiron Corp&lt;/ulink&gt;; US-09604377). This latter form of rTFPI proved to be reliable and was incorporated into both animal and clinical studies. Currently, there are two subtypes of exogenous rTFPI. The first consists of a full-length rTFPI, including both the C-terminal region and all three Kunitz domains. The truncated TFPI, on the other hand, consists of only two Kunitz-type domains as well as a truncated C-terminal (TFPI-2). These properties render this form of TFPI less readily active in binding the TF/VIIa complex in the early phase of the extrinsic pathway. The advantage of using this molecule, however, is that unlike its counterpart, this protein has a longer t1/2 in the circulation, making it a good candidate for the treatment of systemic illnesses such as sepsis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432152"&gt;432152&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Although the precise pharmacology of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8777"&gt;tifacogin&lt;/ulink&gt; is still being investigated, the role of rTFPI in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been described well in animal studies for over a decade. Animal studies examining the role of rTFPI date back nearly 10 years. Warr and colleagues showed in their study that tissue factor (TF) triggered DIC after endotoxin administration [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="218680"&gt;218680&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The hypothesis that TFPI is the main inhibitor of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation in sepsis was supported by studies carried out by Sandset. TFPI-depleted rabbits subjected to iv administration of TF and endotoxin sustained a worse outcome than animals given TFPI [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432172"&gt;432172&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432173"&gt;432173&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Bregengard and colleagues used the truncated, two-domain version of rTFPI, and demonstrated that, when given simultaneously with endotoxin, the drug reduced fibrin deposition in the kidney, as well as preventing thrombocytopenia and decreasing fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, and Factor VIII [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="161173"&gt;161173&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Subsequent studies illustrated the beneficial role of rTFPI in a Gram-negative septic shock baboon model as an inhibitor of DIC and interleukin 6 (IL-6) as well as an enhancer of the anti-inflammatory cascade [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432174"&gt;432174&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="224093"&gt;224093&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Creasey and colleagues administered the TFPI at 30, 120 and 240 min after infecting the animal with E coli. When combined, these properties translated to reduced mortality [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432174"&gt;432174&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The doses used in these studies were substantially higher, ie 6 mg/kg [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432174"&gt;432174&lt;/ulink&gt;] and 2.7 or 7.4 mg/kg [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="224093"&gt;224093&lt;/ulink&gt;]. High doses of rTFPI have also reduced mortality in rat models of Gram-positive sepsis and polymicrobial sepsis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432175"&gt;432175&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Camerota and colleagues compared three doses: 0.1 mg/kg bolus followed by a 1-microg/kg/h infusion (low dose); 0.5 mg/kg followed by a 5-microg/kg/h infusion (mid dose); and, 10 mg/kg followed by a 10-microg/kg/h infusion (high dose) given 4 h after peritonitis was induced [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432179"&gt;432179&lt;/ulink&gt;]. There was no significant difference between the mid and high doses. Animal studies utilizing rTFPI indicate that there is a significant mortality reduction even at circulating rTFPI levels of &amp;lt; 0.002 microg/ml [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432181"&gt;432181&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This group of investigators used much lower doses than had been described previously, diluting it down 10-fold with each group, until they reached a point where there was no significant difference between the drug and vehicle. They went on to show that much lower doses were just as effective. This study formed the basis for the eventual dosage recommendations that were used in the phase II and phase III trials. When translated into human doses, a proposed dose of less than 0.07 mg/kg/h was recommended to attain adequate blood levels, and clinical studies using rTFPI are currently implementing an iv infusion at doses of 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/h [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432178"&gt;432178&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In contrast, in 1996, Elsayed and colleagues studied the effect of rTFPI at two separate doses of 1 and 4 mg/kg on thrombus formation in rats subjected to carageenan and LPS. In support of previous studies, they showed that low doses of rTFPI did not alter the coagulation profile in the septic rat. At a higher dose, however, reduction of fibrinogen, platelet and Factor VIIa consumption was illustrated [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432182"&gt;432182&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This reinforces the notion that therapy with rTFPI in humans may require the administration of higher doses of rTFPI. It has not been investigated whether this discrepancy in the dosing might be related to species variability in the degradation of the human recombinant protein.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In vitro studies using human blood cultures have shown that TFPI can prevent the rise in LPS-induced interleukin 8 (IL-8) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432191"&gt;432191&lt;/ulink&gt;]. TFPI levels may or may not be reduced in septic states, as shown by Novotny and colleagues [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432094"&gt;432094&lt;/ulink&gt;], and the significance of this is not understood fully. The important determinant of the outcome may be the ratio of TFPI to TF.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8777"&gt;Tifacogin&lt;/ulink&gt;, a full-length rTFPI, is usually given as an iv infusion to increase the endogenous TFPI concentration (normally 25 to 120 ng/ml). It is cleared rapidly from the circulation. In rabbits, the t1/2 of full-length rTFPI, such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8777"&gt;tifacogin&lt;/ulink&gt;, was noted to be 2 min [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="161286"&gt;161286&lt;/ulink&gt;], and in rats it was less than 1 min [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432132"&gt;432132&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the liver and the kidneys clear rTFPI. Kemme and colleagues established, by using exercise to reduce hepatic blood flow, that hepatic clearance was important in humans [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432155"&gt;432155&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Two receptors are involved in the uptake and clearance by the liver. The first receptor is a low-density lipoprotein-related protein (LRP), and the second is the low-affinity heparin sulfate proteoglycan binding site that lies on the endothelium and liver. This second site is blocked by protamine, which increases significantly the t1/2 of TFPI in the circulation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432161"&gt;432161&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Recent studies have demonstrated that TFPI (using rTFPI from Chinese hamster ovaries) is inactivated by thrombin when it is incorporated into the fibrin clot. This is attained by the cleavage of three peptide bonds, including one near the C-terminus, one near the Kunitz 2 domain (site of Factor Xa binding), and one between the Kunitz 1 and Kunitz 2 domains [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432164"&gt;432164&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This incorporation is prevented by carboxyaminomethylation of the cysteine residue near the C-terminus.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;No preclinical toxicity data for &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8777"&gt;tifacogin&lt;/ulink&gt; have been reported. The product is generally well tolerated in humans.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I/II&lt;/subtitle&gt;rTFPI has been studied in healthy humans and was shown to inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner, the coagulation system without affecting the fibrinolytic system. Two doses were used: a 0.05-mg/kg/h infusion after a bolus of 0.0125 mg/kg (low dose) and a 0.2-mg/kg/h infusion following a bolus of 0.05 mg/kg (high dose). At these doses, the endotoxin-induced release of tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoylphosphatidylcholine was not affected. In addition, there was no influence on the cytokine response, as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and interleukin 10 (IL-10) were not altered [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432194"&gt;432194&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The same investigators conducted a second study of eight normal volunteers to examine the influence of rTFPI on the inflammatory pathways. They reported that the drug did not influence leukocyte activation, chemokine release (monocyte chemotactic protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, and IL-8), levels of von Willebrand factor and sE-selectin (markers of endothelial activation), or LPS-binding protein and C-reactive protein (acute-phase response proteins) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432183"&gt;432183&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These studies, carried out while the phase III trial was being conducted, suggest that at the doses used in the trial, there would be no effect on the inflammatory pathway.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;After establishing that rTFPI was well tolerated with no side effects in normal human volunteers [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="425817"&gt;425817&lt;/ulink&gt;], a small phase II study of 14 septic patients in which five received placebo, five received rTFPI by infusion at 0.33 mg/kg/h, and four received a higher infusion rate of 0.66 mg/kg/h, demonstrated an increased incidence of serious adverse events involving bleeding in the rTFPI groups. The dosages were reduced in a second study (0.025 to 0.1 mg/kg/h), and there was no comparable difference in the rate of serious adverse events or bleeding [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432150"&gt;432150&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This led to a large, multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind phase II study in 210 patients with sepsis using low-dose infusions of rTFPI (0.025 or 0.05 mg/kg/h). This trial showed that the compound could be used safely in critically ill patients. Biological activity was established as significant decreases in IL-6 and thrombin-anti-thrombin complexes. The levels of TFPI returned to predose levels about 4 h after discontinuing treatment. This study was not powered to detect statistically meaningful differences between the placebo and treatment groups, but there was an 8% absolute decrease in 28-day all-cause mortality between the two groups [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432178"&gt;432178&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;The phase III trial, OPTIMIST, was completed recently. In a statement released by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15385"&gt;Chiron Corp&lt;/ulink&gt; on 21 November 2001, the drug failed to meet the primary endpoint of reducing 28-day all-cause mortality. There were no safety issues identified in the treated patients. The full evaluation of the results of this study is expected next year [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="430106"&gt;430106&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;Results of the large, multicenter phase II trial in 210 patients with sepsis showed that the compound can be used safely in critically ill patients. The incidence of adverse events between the placebo and drug groups, including the subset of patients who had bleeding as an adverse event, was comparable, as were severe adverse events. The group treated with rTFPI, however, had a slightly higher incidence of bleeding as a severe adverse event compared with the placebo group [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432178"&gt;432178&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;It has been clearly established that the inflammatory pathway can set the coagulation cascade in motion [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432086"&gt;432086&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="98012"&gt;98012&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The link back between the coagulation cascade and the inflammatory pathway is less clear. Cytokine expression changes when the clotting mechanism is interfered with, but whether this is a direct effect or a result of reduced organ damage due to thrombosis is yet to be defined. This avenue of research would help researchers tailor the strategy in managing sepsis with the use of anticoagulant therapy.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;After reviewing the studies completed thus far, we still believe that there is a role for the use of TFPI in the management of severe sepsis. Although the initial announcement of the phase III trial appears to be discouraging, further analysis of the data is required to discount this drug. We had expected this result, because based on de Jonge and colleagues' human studies, there is no influence on the inflammatory pathways at the doses used [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432194"&gt;432194&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432183"&gt;432183&lt;/ulink&gt;]. We believe, however, that further analysis will reveal a subset of patients for whom it might be useful, ie the 20 to 30% of patients with septic shock who develop uncompensated DIC. As there are species differences in the metabolism, the dosage used may have to be increased. Furthermore, studies of rTFPI in the presence of other drugs, such as heparin and protamine sulfate, both of which enhance TFPI activity, are required. In addition, as activated protein C is now recognized to be of benefit, studies are required to determine any potential synergism. The role of the 2 Kunitz domain rTFPI, which has a longer t1/2, also has to be clarified.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;We believe that given the complexity of the processes involved in severe sepsis and the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, the use of a single agent may not be the answer.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company
