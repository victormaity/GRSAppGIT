linkID="18767" linkType="Company"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/ulink&gt; has developed and launched tofacitinib citrate (Xeljanz; Jaquinus; CP-690550; ShangJie), a   Janus kinase (JAK)-3 and -1 inhibitor. The product is indicated in the US for the oral treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate (MTX) ;it may be used as monotherapy or in combination with MTX or other nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). It is also indicated for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to MTX or other DMARDs; it is further indicated in the US for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis (UC) [&lt;ulink linkID="1338340" linkType="Reference"&gt;1338340&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In Japan, the drug is indicated for the treatment of adults with RA who have had an inadequate response to existing therapies, and for the remission induction therapy and maintenance therapy of moderate-to-severe UC when the effect is insufficient with existing treatments  [&lt;ulink linkID="2037512" linkType="Reference"&gt;2037512&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1395430" linkType="Reference"&gt;1395430&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2050941" linkType="Reference"&gt;2050941&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In  Europe, the drug in combination with MTX  is indicated  for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active RA in adults who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more DMARDs (it can also  be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate);  in combination with MTX for the treatment of active PsA in adults with inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy; and for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent  [&lt;ulink linkID="1911864" linkType="Reference"&gt;1911864&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2050071" linkType="Reference"&gt;2050071&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2058782" linkType="Reference"&gt;2058782&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By February 2013, the drug was in the early stages of US launch for moderate-to-severe active RA [&lt;ulink linkID="1394366" linkType="Reference"&gt;1394366&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in February 2014, an sNDA was approved by the FDA for expanded labelling to include inhibition of progression of structural damage in patients with RA [&lt;ulink linkID="1528439" linkType="Reference"&gt;1528439&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In  July 2013, tofacitinib was launched in Japan for RA [&lt;ulink linkID="1458126" linkType="Reference"&gt;1458126&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2017,  approval was granted in the EU for moderate-to-severe active RA  [&lt;ulink linkID="1911864" linkType="Reference"&gt;1911864&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;], having been denied approval on its first filing in July 2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1456951" linkType="Reference"&gt;1456951&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The drug was launched in Europe and  UK in April 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="2120843" linkType="Reference"&gt;2120843&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in Sweden in May 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="2151718" linkType="Reference"&gt;2151718&lt;/ulink&gt;]; and by November 2018, the drug had been launched in Finland [&lt;ulink linkID="2151729" linkType="Reference"&gt;2151729&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By May 2017, phase III development was underway in Japan for an additional dosage/formulation setting for RA where existing treatment was inadequate [&lt;ulink linkID="1931579" linkType="Reference"&gt;1931579&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2018, the drug was approved for the remission induction therapy and maintenance therapy of moderate-to-severe UC in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="2037512" linkType="Reference"&gt;2037512&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later in May 2018, the FDA approved an sNDA to expand the drug label to include treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe active UC [&lt;ulink linkID="2038801" linkType="Reference"&gt;2038801&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In July 2018, the EC approved the drug for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent [&lt;ulink linkID="2058782" linkType="Reference"&gt;2058782&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2125593" linkType="Reference"&gt;2125593&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2017, the FDA approved  tofacitinib for the treatment of active PsA [&lt;ulink linkID="1991826" linkType="Reference"&gt;1991826&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In June 2018, the EC approved the drug in combination with MTX for the treatment of active PsA in adult patients with inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy [&lt;ulink linkID="2050071" linkType="Reference"&gt;2050071&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Development in other inflammatory disorders is also ongoing. In March 2013, a phase III trial for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was initiated; in August 2018, the trial was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1255184" linkType="Reference"&gt;1255184&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2017, a phase II pilot trial was initiated for discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) [&lt;ulink linkID="1936286" linkType="Reference"&gt;1936286&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2017, a phase I/II study for scleroderma was initiated; in September 2018, the study was ongoing  [&lt;ulink linkID="1969252" linkType="Reference"&gt;1969252&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, a phase III trial for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="2059950" linkType="Reference"&gt;2059950&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2058709" linkType="Reference"&gt;2058709&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in February 2019, development in AS was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="2125593" linkType="Reference"&gt;2125593&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2019, a clinical trial in patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis and granuloma annulare was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="2140576" linkType="Reference"&gt;2140576&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Pfizer was also previously developing the drug for  psoriasis, transplant rejection, Crohn's disease and asthma.  In February 2015, the FDA accepted for review an sNDA for plaque psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkID="1631502" linkType="Reference"&gt;1631502&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By May 2015, the drug had  also been submitted for approval in Japan  for both  psoriasis and PsA  [&lt;ulink linkID="1666000" linkType="Reference"&gt;1666000&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in October 2015, Pfizer received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA with specific recommendations for the psoriasis sNDA [&lt;ulink linkID="1703316" linkType="Reference"&gt;1703316&lt;/ulink&gt;]; as a result of this, by August 2016,  the company had withdrawn all pending regulatory applications seeking approval of tofacitinib for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, including the US psoriasis sNDA   [&lt;ulink linkID="1785052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1785052&lt;/ulink&gt;] and the Japanese filing that covered both psoriasis and PsA [&lt;ulink linkID="1786181" linkType="Reference"&gt;1786181&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At that time, Pfizer stated that  withdrawal of these filings would allow the company more time to determine the path forward for tofacitinib in this indication and that it did not impact the option to submit an application for tofacitinib for  psoriasis at a later date  [&lt;ulink linkID="1785052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1785052&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1786181" linkType="Reference"&gt;1786181&lt;/ulink&gt;].  By June 2005, phase II trials in kidney transplant recipients had been initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="652603" linkType="Reference"&gt;652603&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, this indication was listed as discontinued by Pfizer in February 2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1387629" linkType="Reference"&gt;1387629&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2007, a phase II study for Crohn's disease began [&lt;ulink linkID="947491" linkType="Reference"&gt;947491&lt;/ulink&gt;], but in May 2011, negative data were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="1189047" linkType="Reference"&gt;1189047&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2012, another phase II Crohn's disease trial began; in July 2015, it was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1687834" linkType="Reference"&gt;1687834&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1681420" linkType="Reference"&gt;1681420&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, by October 2015, Pfizer had discontinued development of the drug for this indication [&lt;ulink linkID="1706880" linkType="Reference"&gt;1706880&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2008, preclinical studies for asthma were ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="882855" linkType="Reference"&gt;882855&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, in January 2010 asthma was not an indication listed on Pfizer's pipeline for tofacitinib [&lt;ulink linkID="1071193" linkType="Reference"&gt;1071193&lt;/ulink&gt;].   &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Pfizer has also developed a &lt;ulink linkID="83185" linkType="Drug"&gt;once daily dosing of tofacitinib in RA&lt;/ulink&gt;, and has also previously developed  a &lt;ulink linkID="69726" linkType="Drug"&gt;topical formulation&lt;/ulink&gt; for atopic dermatitis and an &lt;ulink linkID="65286" linkType="Drug"&gt;ophthalmic solution of tofacitinib&lt;/ulink&gt; for the potential treatment of dry eye and. All these programs  came from the &lt;ulink linkID="73151" linkType="Drug"&gt;program of JAK3 kinase inhibitors&lt;/ulink&gt; under investigation by Pfizer.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><PatentsAndGenerics><displayLabel>Patents and Generics</displayLabel><value>&lt;PatentsAndGenerics&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;The  basic product patent for the drug expires in the US in December 2025 (RE41,783) [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;], a second patent covers an enantiomer of tofacitinib and expires in May 2022 (&lt;ulink linkID="PA3090225" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-07301023&lt;/ulink&gt;), and the third covers a polymorphic form of tofacitinib (&lt;ulink linkID="PA3060917" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-06965027&lt;/ulink&gt;) and expires in March 2023.

In October 2017, Pfizer brought an additional patent-infringement action against Breckenridge in a US District Court  asserting the infringement and validity of four additional patents challenged by Breckenridge, three of which expiring in December 2020 and one of which expiring in December 2025 [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2018, Pfizer brought another patent infringement action against Prinston  asserting the infringement and validity of an additional patent expiring in December 2025, which had been subsequently challenged by Prinston. In May 2018, Pfizer settled all of our claims against Breckenridge on terms not material to Pfizer. In January 2019, Pfizer settled all of the claims against Prinston on terms not material to Pfizer [&lt;ulink linkID="2125593" linkType="Reference"&gt;2125593&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2018, Zhejiang Huahai received tentative approval in the US for their generic version of the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="2077372" linkType="Reference"&gt;2077372&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By February 2017, &lt;ulink linkID="1028350" linkType="Company"&gt;MicroLabs&lt;/ulink&gt; had filed an ANDA for its generic version of tofacitinib 5 mg tablets with the  FDA challenging three patents covering the active ingredient (expiring in December 2025), an enantiomer of tofacitinib (expiring in December 2022) and a polymorphic form of tofacitinib (expiring in December 2023); at that time, Pfizer filed a patent-infringement suit against the company asserting the infringement and validity of the three patents challenged by MicroLabs. Three other patents covering the drug  and expiring in 2020 had not been challenged by MicroLabs [&lt;ulink linkID="1903954" linkType="Reference"&gt;1903954&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Three other patents covering the drug  and expiring in 2020 had not been challenged by MicroLabs [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In April 2019, Zydus Cadila received tentative US FDA approval for its generic version of tofacitinib tablets (5 mg) [&lt;ulink linkID="2138860" linkType="Reference"&gt;2138860&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;SPCs on EP-01666481 have been granted in most EU countries which provides protection to the product until May 2027 [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2019, Pfizer noted that regulatory exclusivity expires in 2028 [&lt;ulink linkID="2125593" linkType="Reference"&gt;2125593&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Japan&lt;/subtitle&gt;The Japanese basic product patent expires in 2025 [&lt;ulink linkID="1530944" linkType="Reference"&gt;1530944&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;China&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2019, &lt;ulink linkID="1046362" linkType="Company"&gt; JiangsuCarephar Pharmaceutical &lt;/ulink&gt;filed an ANDA for its generic version of tofacitinib citrate tablets in China [&lt;ulink linkID="2148060" linkType="Reference"&gt;2148060&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2019, &lt;ulink linkID="1019688" linkType="Company"&gt;Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical&lt;/ulink&gt; filed an ANDA for its generic version of tofacitinib citrate tablets in China [&lt;ulink linkID="2107483" linkType="Reference"&gt;2107483&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2017, &lt;ulink linkID="1025425" linkType="Company"&gt;Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group&lt;/ulink&gt; filed an ANDA for its generic version of tofacitinib citrate tablets with the CFDA [&lt;ulink linkID="2001165" linkType="Reference"&gt;2001165&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2018, the application was granted Priority Review in China as a launch application one year prior to the expiration of the patent [&lt;ulink linkID="2000737" linkType="Reference"&gt;2000737&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/PatentsAndGenerics&gt;</value></PatentsAndGenerics><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2011, a US filing for RA was accepted by the FDA, which set a PDUFA date in August 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1250138" linkType="Reference"&gt;1250138&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2012, the FDA's Arthritis Advisory Committee voted in favor of approval for adults with moderately to severely active RA [&lt;ulink linkID="1289124" linkType="Reference"&gt;1289124&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2012, the FDA requested additional analysis of the data in the NDA; however, no new clinical trials were required. In August 2012, the PDUFA date was extended to November 21, 2012, following submission of additional data to support the NDA [&lt;ulink linkID="1312357" linkType="Reference"&gt;1312357&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1317058" linkType="Reference"&gt;1317058&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2012, tofacitinib was approved in the US for twice daily use in the moderate-to-severe active RA, with a REMS to advise about serious risks associated with tofacitinib and a postmarketing study requirement to evaluate long-term use on heart disease, cancer and serious infections [&lt;ulink linkID="1338213" linkType="Reference"&gt;1338213&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1338217" linkType="Reference"&gt;1338217&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1347419" linkType="Reference"&gt;1347419&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2013, the drug was in the early stages of US launch [&lt;ulink linkID="1394366" linkType="Reference"&gt;1394366&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2013, an sNDA was accepted for review, for expanded labelling to include the inhibition of progression of structural damage in patients with RA; the filing was based on data from the  ORAL Start study [&lt;ulink linkID="1443472" linkType="Reference"&gt;1443472&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2013, patient-reported outcomes data in RA were added to the label, following an sNDA [&lt;ulink linkID="1500747" linkType="Reference"&gt;1500747&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2014, the sNDA was approved with the label updated to include radiographic response data for tofacitinib on the inhibition of progression of structural joint damage [&lt;ulink linkID="1528439" linkType="Reference"&gt;1528439&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Psoriasis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2015, the FDA accepted an sNDA for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. The FDA  provided an anticipated PDUFA action date in October 2015 [&lt;ulink linkID="1631502" linkType="Reference"&gt;1631502&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2015, Pfizer received a CRL from the FDA with specific recommendations for the sNDA. At that time, the company would work with the agency to determine the next steps forward including further safety analyses for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis  [&lt;ulink linkID="1703316" linkType="Reference"&gt;1703316&lt;/ulink&gt;]; later that month, the company stated that it would reconsider further investment in the psoriasis setting subject to the outcome of the FDA's discussions [&lt;ulink linkID="1711379" linkType="Reference"&gt;1711379&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2016, Pfizer was continuing to list the drug as pending approval in the US for psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkID="1762214" linkType="Reference"&gt;1762214&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, by August 2016, the company had withdrawn all pending regulatory applications seeking approval of tofacitinib for psoriasis, including its US sNDA for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkID="1785052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1785052&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1785786" linkType="Reference"&gt;1785786&lt;/ulink&gt;].  At that time, Pfizer stated that  withdrawal of these filings would allow the company more time to determine the path forward for tofacitinib in this indication and that it did not impact the option to submit an application for tofacitinib for  psoriasis at a later date  [&lt;ulink linkID="1785052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1785052&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1786181" linkType="Reference"&gt;1786181&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Psoriatic arthritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2017, the FDA accepted an sNDA for 5 mg twice daily for the treatment of adults with active	PsA for review, with a PDUFA date set in December 2017. The submission was based on data from the OPAL program [&lt;ulink linkID="1923858" linkType="Reference"&gt;1923858&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2017, the US FDA's Arthritis Advisory Committee voted 10 to 1 to recommend approval of the proposed dose of tofacitinib for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis [&lt;ulink linkID="1950664" linkType="Reference"&gt;1950664&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2017, the FDA approved  tofacitinib for the treatment of active PsA [&lt;ulink linkID="1991826" linkType="Reference"&gt;1991826&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Ulcerative colitis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In July 2017, an sNDA was accepted for review by the FDA for use of the product to treat adults with moderately to severely active UC; at that time,  a PDUFA date was scheduled for March 2018. The sNDA included data from the OCTAVE Induction 1, OCTAVE Induction 2, OCTAVE Sustain and OCTAVE Open trials [&lt;ulink linkID="1945042" linkType="Reference"&gt;1945042&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2017, the FDA extended the sNDA action date to June 2018, following additional information submitted by Pfizer which constituted a major amendment [&lt;ulink linkID="1991094" linkType="Reference"&gt;1991094&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2018, the  FDA's Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (GIDAC)  voted unanimously in favor of approval, and  voted against the need to conduct a postmarketing study comparing a tofacitinib 10 mg bid continuous dosing regimen versus a regimen of tofacitinib 10 mg bid induction and 5 mg bid as maintenance in this patient population [&lt;ulink linkID="2011962" linkType="Reference"&gt;2011962&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2018, the FDA approved the sNDA and expanded the drug label to include treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe active UC, based on data from three phase III OCTAVE studies [&lt;ulink linkID="2038801" linkType="Reference"&gt;2038801&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2038812" linkType="Reference"&gt;2038812&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In July 2013, tofacitinib was approved in Switzerland as a monotherapy or in combination with a DMARD for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active RA [&lt;ulink linkID="1452206" linkType="Reference"&gt;1452206&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By December 2015, the drug had been launched in Switzerland [&lt;ulink linkID="2137735" linkType="Reference"&gt;2137735&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2011, the EMA validated the filing of Pfizer's MAA for tofacitinib for moderate-to-severe active RA [&lt;ulink linkID="1241810" linkType="Reference"&gt;1241810&lt;/ulink&gt;]; the review of the filing was ongoing in May 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1289124" linkType="Reference"&gt;1289124&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2013, the CHMP of the EMA adopted a negative opinion, stating that tofacitinib did not demonstrate a favorable risk:benefit profile, and recommended against approval. At that time, Pfizer intended to appeal and  seek a re-examination of the opinion by the CHMP [&lt;ulink linkID="1410708" linkType="Reference"&gt;1410708&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2013, the EMA confirmed its opinion to recommend against approval for moderate-to-severe active RA, following a re-examination of application; although the CHMP noted that tofacitinib reduced the signs and symptoms of RA and improved physical function, the committee was concerned that a favorable risk-benefit profile was not demonstrated. At that time, Pfizer was assessing the feedback and was to determine the next steps for MAA resubmission [&lt;ulink linkID="1456951" linkType="Reference"&gt;1456951&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1457148" linkType="Reference"&gt;1457148&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2013, Pfizer planned to work with the EMA to determine what additional data were needed to resubmit an MAA; at that time, the company expected that this would result in several years' delay [&lt;ulink linkID="1466423" linkType="Reference"&gt;1466423&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2014, Pfizer was listing the drug as back in phase II trials in the EU for RA, presumably following discussions with the EMA [&lt;ulink linkID="1584131" linkType="Reference"&gt;1584131&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By January 2015, Pfizer had discussed the MAA resubmission with European regulators; at that time, the company intended to refile the drug for RA [&lt;ulink linkID="1639611" linkType="Reference"&gt;1639611&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By March 2016, Pfizer had resubmitted an MAA seeking approval of the drug in moderate-to-severe RA patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to MTX, including additional data from the phase III ORAL program studies. At that time, the EMA accepted the MAA for review  [&lt;ulink linkID="1746032" linkType="Reference"&gt;1746032&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2016, the EMA's CHMP discussed issues identified in the application, adopted a day-120 list of questions and agreed to consult the Safety Working Party [&lt;ulink linkID="1799133" linkType="Reference"&gt;1799133&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2017, the EMA's CHMP granted a positive opinion for the approval for moderate-to-severe active RA [&lt;ulink linkID="1896019" linkType="Reference"&gt;1896019&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1896186" linkType="Reference"&gt;1896186&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2017,  approval was granted in the EU for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active RA in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more DMARDs [&lt;ulink linkID="1911864" linkType="Reference"&gt;1911864&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The drug was launched in Europe and  UK in April 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="2120843" linkType="Reference"&gt;2120843&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in Sweden in May 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="2151718" linkType="Reference"&gt;2151718&lt;/ulink&gt;]; and by November 2018, the drug had been launched in Finland [&lt;ulink linkID="2151729" linkType="Reference"&gt;2151729&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2018, the EMA's CHMP  adopted a new strength (10 mg film coated tablets)  [&lt;ulink linkID="2041178" linkType="Reference"&gt;2041178&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Ulcerative colitis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In August 2017, an EU filing for UC was validated by the EMA [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2018, the EMA's CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending approval for  the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely UC with inadequate response, lost response, or  intolerance to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. At that time, the CHMP  adopted a new strength (10 mg film coated tablets)  [&lt;ulink linkID="2041178" linkType="Reference"&gt;2041178&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2018, the EC approved the drug for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent [&lt;ulink linkID="2058782" linkType="Reference"&gt;2058782&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2125593" linkType="Reference"&gt;2125593&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Psoriatic arthritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In September 2017, an EU filing for PsA was validated by the EMA [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2018, the EMA's CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending an extension of tofacitinib indication to include its use in combination with MTX for the treatment of active PsA in adult patients with inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy [&lt;ulink linkID="2028694" linkType="Reference"&gt;2028694&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2018, the EMA's CHMP  adopted a new strength (10 mg film coated tablets)  [&lt;ulink linkID="2041178" linkType="Reference"&gt;2041178&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, the drug was approved in combination with MTX for active PsA [&lt;ulink linkID="2050071" linkType="Reference"&gt;2050071&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Japan&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2011, a regulatory filing was submitted in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="1250138" linkType="Reference"&gt;1250138&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2013, the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council's Second Committee on Drugs reviewed the application and recommended approval of the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="1392527" linkType="Reference"&gt;1392527&lt;/ulink&gt;]; later that month, approval was granted.

However, by August 2016,  Pfizer had withdrawn all pending regulatory applications seeking approval of tofacitinib for psoriasis    [&lt;ulink linkID="1785052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1785052&lt;/ulink&gt;], including  the Japanese filing that covered both psoriasis and PsA [&lt;ulink linkID="1786181" linkType="Reference"&gt;1786181&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At that time, Pfizer stated that  withdrawal of these filings would allow the company more time to determine the path forward for tofacitinib for psoriasis and that it did not impact the option to submit an application for tofacitinib for  this indication at a later date  [&lt;ulink linkID="1785052" linkType="Reference"&gt;1785052&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1786181" linkType="Reference"&gt;1786181&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Ulcerative colitis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2017, a filing was submitted in Japan for UC [&lt;ulink linkID="2007726" linkType="Reference"&gt;2007726&lt;/ulink&gt;];   In April 2018, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's 1st Committee on New Drugs PAFSC recommended the approval of tofacitinib citrate for the remission induction therapy and maintenance therapy of moderate to severe UC [&lt;ulink linkID="2031220" linkType="Reference"&gt;2031220&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In October 2013, similar  data were presented at the 77th ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting in San Diego CA. During months 0 to 12, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were similar across all the treatment groups, but were lower than placebo. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate for GI perforation was 0.144 events/100 patient years [&lt;ulink linkID="1493573" linkType="Reference"&gt;1493573&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In  June 2012, pooled data on cardiovascular (CV) events from five phase III studies and two LTE studies of tofacitinib in RA were presented at EULAR 2012 in Berlin, Germany. Incidence rates (per 100 patient years) of major adverse CV events (MACE)  were low for placebo (0.99) and all doses of tofacitinib (0.57) in phase III studies, and lower still for all doses of tofacitinib in the LTE studies (0.19). The MACE  incidence rates suggested that CV risk was not increased over  3 years of follow-up.

The rates of serious adverse events, Herpes zoster, major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancies and deaths were similar across all the treatment groups [&lt;ulink linkID="1493575" linkType="Reference"&gt;1493575&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2011, pooled safety data from phase III (n = 3030 patients) and LTE studies (n = 3227 patients) of tofacitinib were reported. Results showed that for all doses of tofacitinib (5 or 10 mg bid), the incidence rate for all-cause mortality was 0.572 per 100 patient-years (12 deaths per 2098 patient-years) and 0.641 per 100 patient-years (20 deaths per 3118 patient-years) in the phase III and LTE studies, respectively; the company noted that the results were consistent with the reported rates from individual clinical trials with biological DMARDs in RA patients.  Analyses of the infection rates also showed that nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, bronchitis, herpes zoster and influenza were the most common treatment-emergent infection adverse events (greater than 5% percent in any treatment group) in the LTE studies; infection adverse events in the phase III studies were all less than 5% in any treatment group. Additionally, it was reported that the rate of serious infections among both tofacitinib doses was similar in the phase III studies; however, serious infections occurred more frequently in the 10 mg dose compared to the 5 mg dose in the LTE studies. At that time, further data was scheduled to be presented in November 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1221136" linkType="Reference"&gt;1221136&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2011, a phase III study for RA was ongoing in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="1176389" linkType="Reference"&gt;1176389&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2010, a randomized, double-blind, phase III study (&lt;ulink linkID="62968" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01039688&lt;/ulink&gt;; A3921069; ORAL1069; ORAL Start) began to assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib (5 or 10 mg ) compared with methotrexate in methotrexate-naive patients (estimated n = 900) with moderate-to-severe RA.

For 5 and 10 mg tofacitinib  and methotrexate, at month 6, the modified total sharp score (mTSS) were 0.18, 0.04 and 0.84%, respectively, and ACR70 rates were 25.5, 37.7 and 50.5%, respectively. At all time points, ACR20/50 responses, mean change in DAS28-4(ESR), DAS28-4(ESR) &amp;lt;2.6 rates, and mean change in HAQ-DI, were significantly better with tofacitinib compared methotrexate [&lt;ulink linkID="1343332" linkType="Reference"&gt;1343332&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2013,  interim analysis results (12-month) were presented at the EULAR 2013 Annual Meeting in Madrid, Spain. Over 12 months, the improvements in all the PROs  were statistically significant with tofacitinib when compared with the methotrexate except for the SF-36 mental component score for tofacitinib (5 mg bid).

In May 2011, data were presented at EULAR 2011 in London, UK. ACR20 response, which was the primary endpoint, was achieved by 52.7, 58.3 and 31.2% of the tofacitinib 5 mg, 10 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Both the 5 and 10 mg doses of tofacitinib led to a clinically meaningful reduction in the signs and symptoms of disease and improved physical functioning, which was assessed by mean change in HAQ-DI. Patients on tofacitinib showed dose-dependent decreases in mean neutrophil counts and increases in mean LDL, HDL and total cholesterol  [&lt;ulink linkID="1194509" linkType="Reference"&gt;1194509&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1194487" linkType="Reference"&gt;1194487&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2011, further data were presented at the ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL. Patient reported outcomes (PROs) were presented  from the 12-month study. Patients (n = 792) were randomized (4:4:1:1) to receive tofacitinib (5 or 10 mg bid), placebo advanced to 5 mg tofacitinib bid or placebo advanced to 10 mg tofacitinib bid. At month 3, all non-responders in the  placebo group were advanced to tofacitinib (5 or 10 mg bid). At month 3, statistically significantly greater improvements from baseline in all PROs were observed in both 5 and 10 mg tofacitinib groups, when compared with placebo. Based on patients reporting improvements greater than or equal to minimally clinically important differences (MCID), the numbers needed to treat at month 3, ranged from 4.6 to 6.0 for 5 mg bid dose and  3.7 to 8.3 for 10 mg bid dose of tofacitinib. The patient global assessment of disease activity and pain (visual analog scale) values changed from baseline to month 3 by  -24.82 and -24.18 with 5 mg tofacitinib -28.19 and -26.78 with 10 mg tofacitinib,  compared with -12.54 and -11.38  with placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1231827" linkType="Reference"&gt;1231827&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2012, further data  were presented at the ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting  in Washington, DC. In both studies, depending on patients reporting improvements of minimally clinically important differences or better for various patient reported outcomes (PROs), the numbers needed to treat at month 3 were 3.7 to 7.8 and 3.1 to 10.6 for tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg, respectively. Statistically significant and clinically important improvements in multiple PROs were observed in patients on 5 and 10 mg of tofacitinib when compared with placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1342976" linkType="Reference"&gt;1342976&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Following single- and multiple- dose administration, the absorption and elimination of tofacitinib was rapid. A dose-proportional increase in the mean systemic exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC(0 to tau)) of tofacitinib was observed. The median Tmax value remained unchanged after multiple dosing for 14 days; Tmax value generally occurred at 0.5 to 1 h. The mean apparent half-lives at terminal elimination phase ranged from 2.3 to 4.3 h. Following bid administration of tofacitinib, accumulation in plasma was not observed; similar mean AUC(0 to tau) values were observed on days 1 and 14. Across the dose range, the mean percent of administered dose excreted unchanged in urine was ranging from 18.3 to 27.2%.

The proportion of patients in remission at months 12 and 24 of the OLE study were 82 and 76% (as observed) and 77 and 62% (with non responder imputation, NRI), respectively. Of 21 patients who were in remission &amp;lt; 6 months prior to dose reduction, 15 maintained remission at month 12 of the OLE study [&lt;ulink linkID="2150762" linkType="Reference"&gt;2150762&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2019, up to 5.4 years safety data were presented at 14th ECCO Congress on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in Copenhagen, Denmark, from one phase II study, one phase III study and an open-label OLE study in ulcerative colitis patients (n = 1157) . Except five cases in overall cohort (induction + maintenance groups from three studies), none of the maintenance cohorts reported any mortality events and tofacitinib  was tolerable and the special adverse events of interest did not increase with long-term exposure of the drug, except a dose-dependent increase in risk of Herpes zoster infection. In placebo (n = 198), tofacitinib 5 mg bid (n = 198), tofacitinib 10 mg bid (n = 196) and overall cohort (n = 1157), incidence of AEs was 75.3, 72.2, 79.6 and 83.8%; serious AEs was 6.6, 5.1, 5.6 and 16.3%; and serious infections was 1, 1, 0.5 and 3.4%, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2127815" linkType="Reference"&gt;2127815&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2018, data from the 8-weeks randomized OCTAVE Induction 1 (NCT01465763) and OCTAVE Induction 2 (NCT01458951) and 52-week OCTAVE Sustain maintenance (NCT01458574) studies which evaluated the time to loss of efficacy following tofacitinib, in patients with ulcerative colitis was presented at the 26th UEGW in Vienna, Austria. A total of 174 patients in tofacitinib induction therapy were randomized to placebo in OCTAVE Sustain. At Week 52, the rates of remission, mucosal healing and clinical response, using non-responder imputation in OCTAVE Sustain OCTAVE Sustain were 10.3, 12.6 and 19.0%, respectively and in tofacitinib 10 mg bid in an open-label extension study were 40.4, 55.4 and 75.8% of patients, respectively.

Further subgroup analyses data were presented at the same conference. At week 8 of OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 and week 52 of OCTAVE Sustain, a higher proportion of tofacitinib-treated patients achieved efficacy endpoints when compared with placebo-treated patients in both c5-ASA and n5-ASA subgroups. When compared to n5-ASA subgroup, higher treatment effects were observed within the c5-ASA subgroup when baseline variables were not controlled [&lt;ulink linkID="2127848" linkType="Reference"&gt;2127848&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further results were presented at the same conference. For tofacitinib (10 mg) bid in Induction 1 and 2, numerically higher proportions of remission were seen in patients with BMI &amp;lt; 25 kg/m2 as compared with other BMI groups at week 8. In BMI &amp;gt;/= 30 kg/m2 groups, lower proportion of patients were seen with MH. Highest proportion of remission and MH with BMI 25 to &amp;lt; 30 kg/m2 was seen.

The proportion of patients with a PGA subscore reduction of &amp;gt;/ =1 point from baseline was 52 and 37.6% (week 2; p &amp;lt; 0.0001), 68 versus 51.7% (week 4, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and 63.5 versus 40.6% (week 8, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2090299" linkType="Reference"&gt;2090299&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2018, further data were presented at the 2018 ACG Annual Scientific Meeting in Philadelphia, PA. Numerically greater rates of AEs and infections were observed with tofacitinib 15 mg bid compared with 10 mg bid and with placebo. Deaths, serious AEs, serious infections, herpes zoster, gastrointestinal perforations, opportunistic infections, malignancies, non-melanoma skin cancers, or major adverse cardiovascular events were no observed with tofacitinib 15 mg bid [&lt;ulink linkID="2112293" linkType="Reference"&gt;2112293&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2019, post hoc analysis results were presented at the 2019 DDW in San Diego, CA. Direct versus overall indirect (via MS components) effect of tofacitinib compared to placebo on SF-36 domains like bodily pain, general health, mental health, physical functioning, role emotional, role physical, social functioning and vitality was 34.4, 23.6, 7.1, 9.5, 32.7, 31.2, 25.2 and 32.7% versus 65.6, 76.4, 92.9, 90.5, 67.3, 68.8, 74.8 and 67.3%, respectively. Overall, results showed that tofacitinib directly improved certain aspects of general health status outside of any benefit from improving stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopic appearance, or physician assessment [&lt;ulink linkID="2150796" linkType="Reference"&gt;2150796&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the 2019 DDW in San Diego, CA. Tofacitinib directly affected certain aspects of disease-specific Quality of life (QoL) outside of any benefit from improving stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopical appearance, or physician assessment; and specifically, improved bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, and social functioning via direct path [&lt;ulink linkID="2150708" linkType="Reference"&gt;2150708&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In  March 2016, clinical data from the pooled analysis of phase III induction studies which characterised the exposure-response relationship between tofacitinib plasma concentration and efficacy of tofacitinib in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis were presented  at the 11th Congress of ECCO IBD in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Inter-patient variability in po clearance was 19.9%. Average concentration was a significantly better predictor of efficacy compared with trough concentration for both efficacy endpoints. Predicted difference from placebo in remission for patients in the lowest to highest quartiles of average concentration at dose level of 10 mg bid was 13.7, 14.7, 14.4 and 17.6%, respectively, and 15.1% for all patients at this dose [&lt;ulink linkID="1763563" linkType="Reference"&gt;1763563&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2012, a non-randomized, open-label, parallel-assignment, phase III trial (&lt;ulink linkID="82343" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01470612&lt;/ulink&gt;; A3921139; 2011-004581-14; OCTAVE Open; OCTAVE) began in patients (expected n = 725) in the US, Australia,  Europe, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Israel, Japan, South Korea,  New Zealand, South Africa and Taiwan with moderate-to-severe UC. The primary endpoint was the number of reported adverse events over 12 months. In September 2015, recruitment was ongoing, with completion expected in July 2018  [&lt;ulink linkID="1396702" linkType="Reference"&gt;1396702&lt;/ulink&gt;]; only patients who had completed or who experienced treatment failure in OCTAVE Sustain study or who were non-responders upon completing OCTAVE Induction 1 or OCTAVE Induction 2 trials were to be enrolled in this open-label extension trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1744801" linkType="Reference"&gt;1744801&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2017, interim safety and efficacy data up to three years of treatment were presented at the 25th UEGW meeting in Barcelona, Spain. Patients (n = 914) who were in remission at week 52 of OCTAVE Sustain were treated with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg (bid) and all other patients were treated with tofacitinib 10 mg bid. At months 2, 12 and 24, remission was achieved by 81.5 and 27.5%; 81.9 and 61.5%; and 87.5 and 69.4% of patients, respectively; mucosal healing was achieved by 90 and 40.1%; 91.8 and 72.9%; and 100 and 79.4% of patients, respectively, in the tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg groups [&lt;ulink linkID="1980563" linkType="Reference"&gt;1980563&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2017, further year three interim safety and efficacy data were presented at the 2017 ACG Annual Scientific Meeting in Orlando, FL. In combined tofacitinib dose treatment groups, serious and severe adverse events were reported by 10.4 and 7.8% of patients, respectively. For both tofacitinib doses, the most frequent treatment-emergent AEs reported were ‘infections/infestations’ and ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ by system organ classes; and ‘nasopharyngitis’ and ‘worsening of UC’ by preferred term. In 5 and 10 mg bid tofacitinib treatment groups, serious infections AEs were reported by 4 and 14 patients, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1985425" linkType="Reference"&gt;1985425&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2018, further data of tofacitinib retreatment after treatment interruption were presented at the 13th ECCO Congress on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in Vienna, Austria. In patients who achieved clinical response after 8 weeks of induction therapy with tofacitinib 10 mg bid (OCTAVE Induction 1 or 2), and  entered OCTAVE Sustain receiving placebo and experienced treatment failure between week 8 and up to week 52, and subsequently entered OCTAVE Open on tofacitinib 10 mg bid (n = 101), the month-2 and -12 clinical response rates were 75.8 and 67.5%, respectively; mucosal healing rates were 55.4 and 53.6%, respectively; and remission rates were 40.4 and 43.4%, respectively. The incidence rate of serious AE was 12.4. The safety profile in retreatment subpopulation was consistent with the overall study population [&lt;ulink linkID="2012980" linkType="Reference"&gt;2012980&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. Corresponding values using non-responder imputation, clinical response, remission and mucosal healing was achieved by 52.9, 14.3 and 23.1% of patients at week 8; and 72.9, 45.1 and 54.4% of patients at week 52, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2012948" linkType="Reference"&gt;2012948&lt;/ulink&gt;].  Further data were presented at the same conference. Incident rates of SAE, serious infection events, herpes zoster, herpes zoster SAE, opportunistic infection, malignancies, (excluding NMSC), major adverse cardiovascular event, gastrointestinal perforations and deaths was 6.8, 1.3, 8.7, 0, 0, 1.3, 1.4, 0, 0 and 0 per 100 patient years, respectively. None of the AE led to permanent tofacitinib discontinuation  [&lt;ulink linkID="2012968" linkType="Reference"&gt;2012968&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, further data of tofacitinib 8-week induction non-responders were presented at the 2018 DDW in Washington DC. Of 51.2% of patients who achieved clinical response at week-8 of the OLE study, 72.9% maintained clinical response, and 45.1, 54.4 and 45.1% of patients achieved remission, mucosal healing, and steroid-free remission, respectively, at week-52.

At months 2 and 12 after tofacitinib 10 mg bid treatment, the proportion of patients with clinical response was 75.8 and 67.5%; mucosal healing was 55.4 and 53.6%; and remission was 40.4 and 43.4%, respectively  [&lt;ulink linkID="2038954" linkType="Reference"&gt;2038954&lt;/ulink&gt;].  At the same conference, further data of patients who lost initial clinical response to tofacitinib 10 mg bid in OCTAVE Induction 1 or 2 while receiving tofacitinib 5 mg bid as maintenance therapy in OCTAVE Sustain and entered OCTAVE Open to receive tofacitinib 10 mg bid (n = 57 of 914)  were presented. At month-2 and -12, clinical response was achieved by 58.6 and 68.8% of patients, respectively; mucosal healing by 41.4 and 60.4% of patients, respectively; and remission by 34.5 and 52.1% of patients, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2038989" linkType="Reference"&gt;2038989&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In October 2018, further clinical data from 163  maintenance remission subpopulation were presented at the 26th UEGW in Vienna, Austria. A greater proportion of patients with moderate to severe UC who achieved remission after 52 weeks of tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg bid in OCTAVE Sustain maintained remission, mucosal healing, clinical response and PMS remission with tofacitinib 5 mg bid for up to 24 months in the OLE study. Similar efficacy was observed regardless of whether patients had received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg bid in OCTAVE Sustain [&lt;ulink linkID="2090306" linkType="Reference"&gt;2090306&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. In the tofacitinib 5 mg bid group, higher proportion of patients achieved remission, mucosal healing or clinical response at months 2, 12 and 24 when analyzed as observed and with NRI. In the tofacitinib 10 mg bid group, 28, 41 and 71% of patients achieved remission, mucosal healing and clinical response, respectively, at month 2. The proportions of patients with remission, mucosal healing or clinical response were generally maintained up to month 24 with NRI. There were no new safety risks [&lt;ulink linkID="2090244" linkType="Reference"&gt;2090244&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Improvements in mean partial Mayo score reached statistical significance in the 10- and 15-mg tofacitinib groups compared with placebo. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) scores showed dose-related improvements. There was a statistically significant change in adjusted mean change from baseline for fecal calprotectin at the two highest doses versus placebo. Treatment was well tolerated, with no dose-dependent increases in adverse events.

The benefits of currently available immunosuppressive drugs are countered by numerous side effects, caused mainly by the ubiquitous distribution of the target molecules of these treatments. CP-690550 is expected to overcome these limitations by selectively targeting JAK3, which is expressed largely on immune cells and is only bound by gamma-chain-bearing cytokine receptors involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. CP-690550 exhibited potent immunosuppressive activity in preclinical models of RA and organ transplant rejection. Phase I and II trials demonstrated the efficacy and safety of CP-690550 in preventing transplant rejection and alleviating the symptoms of RA and psoriasis. At the time of publication, CP-690550 was in phase II/III trials in patients with RA, phase II trials in transplant recipients and in patients with psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and a phase I/II trial for dry eye disease (xerophthalmia). Thus, the preclinical and clinical data strongly support the use of CP-690550 to produce sufficient immunosuppression to prevent organ transplant rejection and to treat autoimmune diseases; CP-690550 could herald the beginning of a new generation of safe and effective immunosuppressive therapies.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Immunosuppression is used to prevent organ transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. Organ transplant rejection occurs when T-cells of the host recognize foreign (ie, mismatched) HLA antigens on the graft [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="993051"&gt;993051&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the US in 2006, a total of 28,931 organ transplants were performed, of which 59.1% were renal and 23.0% were hepatic. The 1-year patient and organ graft survival rates for cadaveric kidney transplants are 94.5 and 89.0%, respectively; for kidney transplants from a live donor, the rates are 97.9 and 95.1%, respectively. For liver transplant overall, 1-year patient and organ graft survival rates are 88.3 and 82.0%, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="994774"&gt;994774&lt;/ulink&gt;]. T-cells also play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of RA [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="993054"&gt;993054&lt;/ulink&gt;] and psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="993058"&gt;993058&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the US in 2005, 1.29 million adults aged over 18 years were estimated to have RA [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="993057"&gt;993057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition, 5.8 and 7.5 million individuals in the US are estimated to have psoriasis, of which 10 to 30% will develop psoriatic arthritis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="994776"&gt;994776&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Current immunosuppressive treatment options for transplant rejection include steroids, the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt;, the purine biosynthesis inhibitors &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3669"&gt;mycophenolate mofetil&lt;/ulink&gt; (MMF) and enteric-coated mycophenolic acid, and the mTOR inhibitor &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4200"&gt;sirolimus&lt;/ulink&gt;. The short-term efficacy of these agents is often good, although these treatments are associated with numerous severe side effects, including cardiovascular risk factors, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, new-onset post-transplant diabetes, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986091"&gt;986091&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Moreover, cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of graft loss and patient mortality in recipients of renal transplants [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986086"&gt;986086&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986088"&gt;986088&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Drug therapies for RA include disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate (MTX), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14163"&gt;adalimumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6850"&gt;infliximab&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4567"&gt;etanercept&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7274"&gt;anakinra&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2888"&gt;abatacept&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6736"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="994779"&gt;994779&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Drug therapies for psoriasis include topical treatments such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="12242"&gt;calcipotriol&lt;/ulink&gt; and steroid creams, and the systemic biological agents &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4567"&gt;etanercept&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14163"&gt;adalimumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6850"&gt;infliximab&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;. Other systemic agents used to treat psoriasis include cyclosporine, MTX and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2417"&gt;acitretin&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="994776"&gt;994776&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Many of these therapies have specific targets; for example, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14163"&gt;adalimumab&lt;/ulink&gt; is a mAb targeting TNFalpha [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="504666"&gt;504666&lt;/ulink&gt;]; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4567"&gt;etanercept&lt;/ulink&gt; is a fusion protein of the TNF receptor and IgG1, and acts as a TNF inhibitor [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="482675"&gt;482675&lt;/ulink&gt;]; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2888"&gt;abatacept&lt;/ulink&gt; is a T-cell surface glycoprotein CD28 inhibitor [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="645239"&gt;645239&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In contrast, the existing immunosuppressant medicines used in transplant rejection target ubiquitously distributed molecules [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986091"&gt;986091&lt;/ulink&gt;], such as calcineurin (targeted by cyclosporine) and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (targeted by MMF); the broad distribution of these molecules leads to the observed side effects of immunosuppressants. There is therefore a need to develop immunosuppressant drugs with comparable or superior efficacy to existing therapies, with the absence of severe side effects. One way of achieving this goal is the development of compounds that act upon molecular targets with expression that is limited to cells of the immune system [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986092"&gt;986092&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986094"&gt;986094&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;One potential source for such a target is a small family of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases known as the JAKs, which comprise JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2. These kinases are crucial for initiating cytokine-activated signaling pathways associated with the phosphorylation of STAT [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="590813"&gt;590813&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986109"&gt;986109&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway involves binding of a cytokine ligand to its receptor, resulting in dimerization of the receptor [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="993060"&gt;993060&lt;/ulink&gt;]. JAK is recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of the dimerized receptor and becomes phosphorylated. Monomeric STAT docks with phosphorylated JAK and becomes phosphorylated itself before dissociating into the cytoplasm. Phosphorylated STAT then dimerizes and is translocated to the nucleus, where the molecule binds with the promoter of the target gene to elicit gene expression. STAT then dissociates from the promoter, is dephosphorylated and is finally exported into the cytoplasm in monomeric form [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="993060"&gt;993060&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The gamma-chain (gammac)-bearing cytokine receptors IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 are important for the development and homeostasis of immune cells. Patients with SCID, for example, have gammac mutations [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986098"&gt;986098&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986101"&gt;986101&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, the cytokine receptors bearing gammac require JAK3 for signaling, and a SCID phenotype is also observed in patients lacking the expression of JAK3 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="260468"&gt;260468&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986108"&gt;986108&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Compared with other widely expressed members of the JAK family, JAK3 expression is limited mainly to hematopoietic cells; high levels of JAK3 are expressed in NK-cells and thymocytes. This kinase is also inducible in T- and B-cells and myeloid cells, but JAK3 is not expressed in resting T-cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="384445"&gt;384445&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Therefore, JAK3 has been identified as a potential target for a second generation of novel immunosuppressants.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18767"&gt;Pfizer Inc&lt;/ulink&gt; is developing CP-690550, a novel, potent and selective inhibitor of JAK3 that blocks cytokine signaling and cytokine-mediated gene expression [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511108"&gt;511108&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Because of the relative lack of affinity of this compound for other JAKs, CP-690550 has the potential advantage of not causing the side effects associated with immuno-suppressant drugs targeting ubiquitously expressed targets. The compound was therefore selected for development for the potential prevention of transplant rejection and the treatment of RA, psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CP-690550 is also being developed for the treatment of xerophthalmia. At the time of publication, phase II and III clinical trials were ongoing for these indications [ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="4077"&gt;NCT00414661&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="7387"&gt;NCT00603512&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="5822"&gt;NCT00550446&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="24689"&gt;NCT00483756&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="40251"&gt;NCT00658359&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="24687"&gt;NCT00556257&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="15874"&gt;NCT00678210&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="36803"&gt;NCT00678561&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="18497"&gt;NCT00615199&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="34619"&gt;NCT00787202&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="33733"&gt;NCT00784719&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition, the compound is also being investigated in preclinical studies for the potential treatment of asthma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="882855"&gt;882855&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;CP-690550 was developed to provide improved immunosuppressive efficacy with less toxicity than current therapies. Several thousand primary compounds were screened in vitro for JAK3 inhibitory activity, leading to the identification of the lead compound CP-352664. Extensive chemical modifications to improve the kinase-inhibitory activity of this molecule led to the discovery of the novel JAK3-specific inhibitor CP-690550, a substituted piperidine linked to a deazapurine. Both enzyme- and cell-based assays demonstrated that CP-690550 was a potent and selective JAK3 inhibitor [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511108"&gt;511108&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968743"&gt;968743&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;All four enantiopure stereoisomers of CP-690550 were synthesized to investigate the significance of stereochemistry on the selective kinase inhibition of the compound. Only the (3R,4R)-isomer of CP-690550 blocked JAK3-dependent STAT5 phosphorylation, suggesting that the configurations of the alternative stereoisomers decreased the propensity for JAK3 inhibition. The four stereoisomers were profiled using a panel of 354 kinases and KINOMEscan technology. A high level of selectivity was observed for the JAK family, with each stereoisomer retaining a degree of binding to JAK3 and JAK2. Moreover, the (3R,4S)- and (3S,4R)-stereoisomers also possessed binding affinity for certain members of the signal transducing MAP kinase kinase (STE)7 and STE20 subfamily of kinases. An analysis of the minimum energy conformation of each stereoisomer demonstrated that only the (3R,4R)-stereoisomer bound the JAK3 catalytic site in a conformation resembling the minimum energy conformation of CP-690550; the other three stereoisomers had to adopt unlikely high-energy conformations to dock with JAK3 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="975308"&gt;975308&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Enantiopure CP-690550 could be synthesized in kilogram quantities starting from (3R,4R)-1-benzyl-N,4-dimethylpiperidin-3-amine. The high yield was based on an elegant and efficient four-step synthesis beginning with piperidine-3-amine from 4-methylpyridin-3-amine. The 4-amino group of pyridine was protected as methyl carbamate, then hydrogenated over rhodium-on-carbon (Rh/C) catalyst in acetic acid, followed by reductive benzylation of piperidine nitrogen to produce methyl (3R,4R)-1-benzyl-4-methylpiperidin-3-yl carbamate in high yield and purity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="991276"&gt;991276&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The chiral methyl carbamate was reduced with lithium aluminum hydride to yield the required (3R,4R)-piperidine-3-amine reactant, which was refluxed with 4-chloro-7-tosyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine and potassium carbonate under nitrogen to produce N-((3R,4R)-1-benzyl-4-methylpiperidin-3-yl)-N-methyl-7-tosyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine. After removing the tosyl group at the 7-position and debenzylation of piperidine nitrogen using standard base hydrolysis and hydrogenation conditions, respectively, the piperidine nitrogen was alkylated with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate and diisopropylethylamine in dimethylformamide to produce CP-690550. The stereochemistry at the C(3)-position of the piperidine ring in CP-690550 was established using alternative synthesis starting from l-serine via (R)-tert-butyl 2,2-dimethyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)oxazolidine-3-carboxylate and (R)-tert-butyl 1-(allyl(benzyl)amino)-3-methylbut-3-en-2-ylcarbamate as key intermediates [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="975308"&gt;975308&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The synthesis of the racemate of CP-690550 was described in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="WO109657"&gt;WO-0142246&lt;/ulink&gt;, while alternative stereoselective procedures were reported in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3460912"&gt;WO-2007012953&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA171141"&gt;WO-02096909&lt;/ulink&gt;.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vitro&lt;/subtitle&gt;The inhibitory potency of CP-690550 was examined in vitro for 33 kinases purified from Escherichia coli or insect cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511108"&gt;511108&lt;/ulink&gt;]. CP-690550 was a potent inhibitor of JAK3, with an IC50 value of 1 nM. By comparison, the potency of CP-690550 was 20- and 112-fold lower for JAK2 (IC50 = 20 nM) and JAK1 (IC50 = 112 nM), respectively. Moreover, CP-690550 lacked potent activity against the 30 other kinases (all IC50 values &amp;gt; 3000 nM), which included leukocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck; an integral T-cell-signaling molecule), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and EGFR [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511108"&gt;511108&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Differing results were obtained in a subsequent study, in which no significant difference was observed between the selectivity of CP-690550 for JAK2 and JAK3 in either a luminescent kinase assay (IC50 = 11 and 13 nM, respectively) or a radiometric filter binding assay (IC50 = 6 and 5 nM, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968743"&gt;968743&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in a TF1 cellular assay, CP-690550 demonstrated a 10-fold greater selectivity for JAK3 (IL-4-induced proliferation inhibition; IC50 = 80 nM) over JAK2 (IL-3-induced proliferation inhibition; IC50 = 800 nM) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968743"&gt;968743&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In cell-based assays, CP-690550 potently inhibited the IL-2-induced proliferation of human T-cells (IC50 = 11 nM; a JAK3-mediated process) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511108"&gt;511108&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, the compound was 30-fold less effective at inhibiting GM-CSF-induced proliferation of HUO3 cells (IC50 = 324 nM; a process elicited by JAK2). Moreover, CP-690550 had no significant inhibitory activity against T-cell receptor signaling or serum-induced fibroblast proliferation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511108"&gt;511108&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Conversely, the compound demonstrated potent inhibitory activity in a mixed lymphocyte reaction using murine cells (IC50 = 91 +/- 66 nM), and also in monkey or human cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511108"&gt;511108&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="643612"&gt;643612&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Subsequent cell-based assays using IL-2-stimulated NK-like cells (YT cells) demonstrated that CP-690550 had the ability to block IL-2-induced phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT (one of the key substrates of JAK3) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511108"&gt;511108&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Additionally, CP-690550 demonstrated increased antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects against cells with the Val617Phe JAK2 mutation, which is detectable in patients with polycythemia vera [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986111"&gt;986111&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vivo&lt;/subtitle&gt;The potential of CP-690550 for immunosuppression and transplant rejection was investigated in C57BL/6 mice chronically treated with CP-690550 (1.5 to 15 mg/kg/day via osmotic pump); CP-690550 produced dose- and time-dependent decreases in splenic lymphocyte subsets [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="643612"&gt;643612&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The most affected cells were NK1.1+TCRbeta- and CD3+CD8+, with reductions of 93 and 96%, respectively, observed after 21 days of treatment with CP-690550; these results were indicative of the compound blocking gammac signaling. Moreover, in a sheep RBC-induced footpad-swelling model of murine delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), CP-690550 (1.87 to 30 mg/kg sc, qd) dose-dependently delayed DTH with a maximum inhibition of approximately 80% (at a dose of 30 mg/kg) compared with control animals [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="643612"&gt;643612&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Following the administration of CP-690550 (1, 10 or 30 mg/kg/day po, for 14 days) to cynomolgus monkeys, dose- and time-dependent decreases in circulating NK-cells and CD8+ T-cells from baseline were observed, with maximum decreases of approximately 80 and 43%, respectively, compared with 35 and 25%, respectively, for controls. An analysis of whole blood from the cynomolgus monkeys indicated that this effect was mediated via an inhibition of IL-15-induced CD69 expression in NK-cells and CD8+ T-cells (IC50 = 48 and 16.2 nM, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="643609"&gt;643609&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Several in vivo transplantation models have been used to assess the immunosuppressive effects of CP-690550. In a murine heterotopic heart transplantation model in which C57BL/6 mice were implanted with DBA2 donor hearts, animals treated with CP-690550 (44 +/- 53, 81 +/- 71 and 136 +/- 45 ng/ml for 28 days via osmotic pump) achieved a transplant mean survival time (MST) of more than 60 days, compared with 12 days in all control animals; the EC50 value required for an MST of more than 28 days was approximately 60 ng/ml. A subsequent RNA analysis of samples from the transplanted mice demonstrated that CP-690550 reduced the expression of several chemokines: Fas ligand, granzyme B, IP-10 (IFN-inducible protein 10), monokine induced by IFNgamma (MIG) and RANTES. All of these chemokines are the product of genes regulated by IFNgamma, which is expressed by an IL-2-dependent gene [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511108"&gt;511108&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In another murine transplantation model, neonatal BALB/c cardiac allografts were implanted into the ear of C3H/HEN mice [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="643612"&gt;643612&lt;/ulink&gt;]. CP-690550 (5 to 30 mg/kg/day via osmotic pump, for 28 days) dose-dependently prolonged cardiac graft survival and produced effects that were comparable with cyclosporine (10 mg/kg ip). Mice receiving 10, 15 and 30 mg/kg/day CP-690550 achieved graft MSTs of 13, 17 and 18 days, respectively, compared with 11 days for vehicle-treated control mice. However, CP-690550 demonstrated little or no efficacy at lower doses (0.5, 1.5 and 5 mg/kg/day), although graft MST was enhanced by the addition of cyclosporine (10 mg/kg ip) to the low-dose CP-690550 regimens; the percentage of grafts surviving more than 14 days for the combinations of cyclosporine with 0.5, 1.5 and 5 mg/kg/day of CP-690550 increased from 0 to approximately 22%, approximately 8 to 60%, and approximately 22 to 85%, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="643612"&gt;643612&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The immunosuppressive efficacy of CP-690550 was also assessed in two studies in a nonhuman primate model (cynomolgus monkeys) of allotransplantation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="643607"&gt;643607&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986112"&gt;986112&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In one study, life-supporting renal transplants were performed between mixed leukocyte reaction-mismatched, ABO blood group-matched cynomolgus monkeys, and CP-690550 was administered (po, bid) to obtain trough blood levels of 1 to 147 ng/ml [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986112"&gt;986112&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The renal allograft survival of treated animals was 53 +/- 7 days compared with 7 +/- 1 days for vehicle-treated control animals. After 90 days, CP-690550 was demonstrated histologically to significantly delay transplant rejection by 46 +/- 7 days following transplantation, compared with 7 +/- 1 days in control animals [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986112"&gt;986112&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were reported from a second study in cynomolgus monkeys receiving CP-690550 (15 mg/kg po, bid) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="643607"&gt;643607&lt;/ulink&gt;] and, in both studies, significant reductions in the number of NK-cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were measured [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="643607"&gt;643607&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986112"&gt;986112&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a further study in a cynomolgus monkey model of allotransplantation, CP-690550 was administered (po, bid for up to 90 days) at the time of kidney transplantation. Animals attaining low (50 to 100 ng/ml) and high (200 to 400 ng/ml) 12-h trough levels had significantly prolonged graft MST (62 +/- 6 and 83 +/- 6 days, respectively, compared with 6 ± 1 days for vehicle-treated control animals) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511108"&gt;511108&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Moreover, in this model, a combination of CP-690550 (2 to 8.7 mg/kg/day po) plus MMF (po, bid to achieve 12-h trough levels of 2 microg/ml) significantly prolonged graft survival time compared with MMF alone (MST = 59.5 +/- 9.8 versus 23 +/- 1 days) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968749"&gt;968749&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The immunosuppressive efficacy of CP-690550 was also assessed in a rat model of aorta transplantation, in which Lewis rats received heterotopic aorta transplants from AxC Irish rats [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968747"&gt;968747&lt;/ulink&gt;]. CP-690550 (via osmotic pump for up to 56 days) was administered to achieve a steady-state blood concentration of 110 +/- 38 ng/ml. At day 56, treated animals exhibited a 51% reduction in intimal hyperplasia compared with untreated control animals. There were also significant reductions in donor-specific IgG production and in the expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). However, no changes were observed in levels of RANTES, IP-10 or TGFbeta1 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968747"&gt;968747&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a rat model of tracheal transplantation, CP-690550 (dosage not stated, administered via osmotic minipump for up to 28 days) significantly prevented indicators of obliterative bronchiolitis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986113"&gt;986113&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At day 28, airway obliteration in treated animals was 2.7% compared with 90% in an untreated control group. The loss of epithelial coverage was also improved, with a 0% loss in the CP-690550 group compared with a 100% loss in control animals. Moreover, animals receiving CP-690550 had reduced levels of lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration into the graft tissue compared with untreated controls. The effects of CP-690550 were comparable to those observed using &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4200"&gt;sirolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986113"&gt;986113&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The prevention of obliterative bronchiolitis after transplantation by CP-690550 was associated with TGFbeta3 expression compared with untreated controls; however, no changes to the levels of TGFbeta1, PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta were observed between CP-690550-treated animals and controls [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986116"&gt;986116&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;CP-690550 was also assessed in two rodent models of RA [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="898753"&gt;898753&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968748"&gt;968748&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the murine collagen-induced arthritis model, CP-690550 (1.5, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day via osmotic minipump, for 28 days) dose-dependently reduced the signs of RA (including inflammatory swelling and cartilage and bone damage) compared with untreated controls, with an ED50 of approximately 1.5 mg/kg/day. The administration of 5 and 15 mg/kg/day of the drug resulted in a significant, near-total suppression of clinical scores (signs of arthritis including swelling and redness in paws), with more than a 90% disease reduction observed at 15 mg/kg/day compared with untreated controls. Similarly, in a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model, CP-690550 (1.5, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day via osmotic minipump, for 14 days) dose-dependently reduced footpad swelling, with near-complete suppression of paw edema at 5 and 15 mg/kg/day and significant reductions in cartilage damage at 15 mg/kg/day (only assessed at this dose) compared with untreated controls [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="898753"&gt;898753&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Additionally, the anti-inflammatory activity of CP-690550 was assessed in a murine model of pulmonary eosinophilia (for diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="890867"&gt;890867&lt;/ulink&gt;]. After a 14-day sensitization and boost phase (with chick egg ovalbumin), animals were exposed to aerosols of either PBS or ovalbumin in PBS (antigen-challenge phase). Broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid sampling was conducted after the final aerosol exposure. Compared with vehicle-treated control animals, mice treated with CP-690550 (15 mg/kg/day via osmotic minipump) during the antigen sensitization and boost phase had substantially reduced BAL eosinophil counts and also decreased levels of IL-13 and eotaxin following antigen challenge. CP-690550 (1.5 to 15 mg/kg/day via osmotic minipump) had similar effects when administered during the antigen-challenge phase. These results were in contrast to the activity of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; (10 mg/kg), which was only effective when administered during the antigen-challenge phase [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="890867"&gt;890867&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;In a cynomolgus monkey model of renal allotransplantation, animals received CP-690550 (po, bid) to attain trough blood levels of 1 to 147 ng/ml. Toxicities were observed in animals achieving higher trough levels, including persistent anemia, polyoma virus-like nephritis and urinary calcium carbonate secretions [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986112"&gt;986112&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In another study in cynomolgus monkeys, anemia and gastrointestinal disturbances were observed in monkeys receiving a combination of CP-690550 (2 to 8.7 mg/kg/day po) plus MMF (po, bid to achieve 12-h trough levels of 2 microg/ml); one incidental lymphosarcoma was also noted [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968749"&gt;968749&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Treatment with the combination initially reduced hemoglobin levels, and was accompanied by a slight increase (generally &amp;lt; 5%) in reticulocyte counts; hemoglobin levels recovered at the end of the study period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968749"&gt;968749&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism and pharmacokinetics&lt;/subtitle&gt;Following the administration of CP-690550 (2 to 8.7 mg/kg/day po) to cynomolgus monkeys, mean 12-h trough levels and mean AUC0-12 h values were dose independent, ranging from 5.8 to 33.2 ng/ml and 372 to 1682 ng.h/ml, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968749"&gt;968749&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In another study in cynomolgus monkeys, mean AUC0-12 h values increased in a near-dose-dependent manner, ranging from 28 to 6225 ng.h/ml, with mean 12-h trough levels of 1 to 195 ng/ml [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986112"&gt;986112&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The pharmacokinetic profile of CP-690550 (5, 15 and 30 mg po, bid for 28 days and qd on day 29) was evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in stable renal transplant patients (n = 28) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="935893"&gt;935893&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986118"&gt;986118&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Values for Cmax and AUC0-12 h increased dose-dependently on days 1 and 29. On day 1, Cmax values were 41, 140 and 325 ng/ml at doses of 5, 15 and 30 mg, respectively, and AUC0-12 h values were 183, 754 and 1200 ng.h/ml, respectively. On day 29, Cmax values were 52.2, 220 and 351 ng/ml at the respective doses, and AUC0-12 h values were 273, 1090 and 1420 ng.h/ml, respectively. The mean half-lives at 5, 15 and 30 mg were 5.2, 5.2 and 3.7 h, respectively. The concomitant administration of cyclosporine (100 to 300 mg/day), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; (2 to 20 mg/day) or MMF (500 to 1000 mg bid) had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of CP-690550. Levels of CP-690550 were slightly elevated in transplant recipients receiving concomitant cyclosporine and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt;. In patients receiving simultaneous MMF, there was no increase in levels of CP-690550, although increases of 21 to 28% in mycophenolic acid levels (the active metabolite of MMF) were noted, but were not statistically significant compared with placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="935893"&gt;935893&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986118"&gt;986118&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase I, open-label clinical trial, healthy adults (n = 12) received a single dose of CP-690550 (30 mg po), followed 72 h later by a dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44292"&gt;fluconazole&lt;/ulink&gt; (400 mg), and followed by further lower doses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44292"&gt;fluconazole&lt;/ulink&gt; (200 mg for 6 days) beginning the next day; a second dose of CP-690550 (30 mg) was administered on the fourth day of 200-mg &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44292"&gt;fluconazole&lt;/ulink&gt; administration. Following coadministration, the AUC and Cmax values of CP-690550 increased by 79 and 27%, respectively. This effect was thought to be related to the ability of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="44292"&gt;fluconazole&lt;/ulink&gt; to inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="887505"&gt;887505&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In another phase I, open-label clinical trial, patients with RA (n = 12) received a weekly dose of MTX (15 to 25 mg/week on day 1 for at least 4 weeks), and were subsequently treated with CP-690550 (30 mg po, every 12 h on days 3 to 6 of each week, including a morning dose on day 7, followed with the next weekly MTX dose) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="887466"&gt;887466&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="987138"&gt;987138&lt;/ulink&gt;]. MTX had no effects on the AUC12 h and Cmax values of CP-690550; mean AUC12 h values were 1410 and 1370 ng.h/ml for the combination of MTX and CP-690550 and for CP-690550 alone, respectively, and Cmax values were 384 and 375 ng/ml, respectively. CP-690550 caused 10 and 13% decreases in AUC12 h (AUC12 h = 1720 and 1850 ng.h/ml in combination and for CP-690550 alone, respectively) and Cmax values (Cmax = 433 and 478 ng/ml, respectively) of MTX, respectively; neither reduction by CP-690550 appeared to be clinically relevant [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="987138"&gt;987138&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of CP-690550 (10 mg po) were assessed in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis (n = 12) and patients with mild (50 to 80 ml/min), moderate (30 to 50 ml/min) or severe (&amp;lt; 30 ml/min) impaired renal function (n = 24) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="987235"&gt;987235&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The mean AUC0-8 h in patients with end-stage renal disease on a non-dialysis day was 40% higher compared with historical data from healthy volunteers. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean AUC0-8 h ratios were 137, 143 and 223%, respectively, relative to volunteers with normal renal function [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="987235"&gt;987235&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;Transplant rejection&lt;br/&gt;A phase I, double-blind, dose-escalating, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessed CP-690550 (5, 15 and 30 mg po, bid for 28 days and qd on day 29) in stable renal transplant patients (n = 28; 6, 6, 10 and 6 patients received 5, 15 and 30 mg and placebo, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="935893"&gt;935893&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The simultaneous use of steroids remained unchanged throughout the trial, and patients treated with the two lower doses of CP-690550 received concomitant cyclosporine (100 to 300 mg/day), &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; (2 to 20 mg/day) or MMF (500 to 1000 mg bid). On day 29, CP-690550 was associated with an increase in blood CD19+ cell count (by 129% at 30 mg compared with baseline), which returned to baseline on day 57; and a decrease in CD16+ and CD56+ cell counts (both by approximately 50% at 15 and 30 mg compared with baseline), which persisted until day 57. There were no effects on CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="935893"&gt;935893&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A subgroup analysis on peripheral immune parameters was conducted in patients (n = 8) in the 30-mg group, all of whom received MMF and prednisolone (5 to 7.5 mg qd) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986119"&gt;986119&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Leukocyte counts remained stable throughout the trial. However, after 29 days, CP-690550 induced statistically significant changes in several peripheral immune parameters compared with pretreatment baseline levels. These changes included a mean 65% reduction in CD3-CD16+CD56+ NK-cells and a 100% increase in the number of circulating CD19+ B-cells (the latter effect was reversible by day 57 and was not associated with changes in IgG, IgA and IgM levels). There was also a 38% decline in the absolute number of CD4+CD25bright+ T-cells, although the regulatory capacity of the remaining cells of this type was unchanged. No significant changes were observed in the absolute numbers of CD3+, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cells. Moreover, IFNgamma production by PBMCs was decreased by 39% on day 29 (this effect also was reversed by day 57) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986119"&gt;986119&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Psoriasis&lt;br/&gt;A phase I, double-blind, dose-escalation, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated CP-690550 (5, 10, 20, 30 or 50 mg po, bid, or 60 mg po, qd, both for 14 days) in healthy volunteers with psoriatic lesions (n = 59) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968745"&gt;968745&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="993821"&gt;993821&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At day 14, significant, dose-dependent improvements in a modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (mPASI) were observed compared with placebo in all patients receiving CP-690550 (with the exception of the 5-mg bid dose cohort); mPASI was reduced by 28, 47, 53, 52, 72 and 43% at doses of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 mg twice daily and 60 mg once daily, respectively, compared with 11.5% with placebo. Overall disease status, as determined by Physician Global Assessment (PGA), was also significantly improved at this time point with doses of 20, 30 and 50 mg twice daily compared with placebo; PGA improvements were 10, 30, 52, 76, 55 and 42% at doses of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 mg twice and 60 mg once daily, respectively, compared with 11.8% with placebo. Moreover, the reversal of hyperplasia and other disease pathologies was apparent at a dose of CP-690550 of 30 mg twice daily, as demonstrated by a complete reversal of keratin 16 expression in three out of four skin biopsies from treated patients. In patients receiving 50 mg of CP-690550 twice daily, the drug induced marked alterations in the CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+/CD56+ and CD19+ lymphocyte subsets; these effects were absent from patients receiving the lowest dose of CP-690550, and were variable in the other treatment groups [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968745"&gt;968745&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis&lt;br/&gt;A phase IIa, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="2285"&gt;NCT00147498&lt;/ulink&gt;) was conducted to assess the efficacy of CP-690550 (5, 15 or 30 mg po, bid) in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe RA (n = 264) over a 6-week period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="886059"&gt;886059&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968744"&gt;968744&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986283"&gt;986283&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patient prerequisites were evidence of systemic inflammation, &gt;/= 6 swollen joints and &gt;/= 9 painful or tender joints; an intolerance of, or unresponsiveness to, MTX or TNF inhibitors; and discontinuation of DMARDs or biological therapies. However, patients receiving stable background NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors or low-dose glucocorticoids and analgesics were allowed to enroll. Beginning at week 1 of the trial, changes in arthritic symptoms, functional disability and health status were measured using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, the patients' assessment of pain, the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and the SF-36 Health Survey (assessments include physical function, bodily pain, vitality and mental health) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="886059"&gt;886059&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968744"&gt;968744&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986283"&gt;986283&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At baseline, mean tender joint counts, mean swollen joint counts and mean Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 ranged from 26.7 to 32.3, 16.2 to 21.1 and 5.7 to 6.2, respectively. All three doses of CP-690550 were effective at week 6, with ACR20, 50 and 70 responses of 70 to 80%, 33 to 54% and 13 to 28%, respectively, compared with 29, 6 and 3% in the placebo cohort [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986283"&gt;986283&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Throughout the 6 weeks, treatment with the 15- and 30-mg twice-daily doses of CP-690550 significantly ameliorated pain compared with baseline levels; the 5-mg twice-daily dose ameliorated pain at weeks 4 to 6 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968744"&gt;968744&lt;/ulink&gt;]. CP-690550 dose-dependently reduced HAQ-DI scores throughout the trial; clinically significant decreases in HAQ-DI (ie, by at least 0.3 units) at week 6 were observed in 57, 75 and 76% of patients receiving doses of 5, 15 or 30 mg twice daily, respectively, compared with 36% in the placebo group. All CP-690550-treated patients demonstrated significant improvements in SF-36 at week 1, and these improvements continued throughout the trial [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968744"&gt;968744&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, the 15- and 30-mg twice-daily doses significantly improved remission rates compared with placebo, as determined by the Simplified Disease Activity Index (7.4 and 7.6%, respectively, versus 0% at week 6), Clinical Disease Activity Index (12.1 and 12.5%, respectively, versus 0% at week 6) and DAS28 (30.4 and 25%, respectively, versus 2.1% at week 6) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="886059"&gt;886059&lt;/ulink&gt;]. An analysis of absolute neutrophil counts demonstrated mean reductions from baseline of 0.9, 1.6 and 2.2 x 10(9)/l at with doses of 5, 15 and 30 mg twice daily by week 6 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="987263"&gt;987263&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase IIb, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="2322"&gt;NCT00413660&lt;/ulink&gt;) evaluated CP-690550 (1, 3, 5, 10, 15 mg po, bid or 20 mg po, qd) in patients with RA (n = 509) on stable background MTX over a 6-month period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="974406"&gt;974406&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients had active disease with &gt;/= 6 tender joints and &gt;/= 6 swollen joints. Patients who did not achieve ACR20 at doses of 1 and 3 mg twice daily and 20 mg once daily at week 12 were reassigned to receive 5 mg twice daily. At baseline, mean tender joint counts, swollen joint counts, HAQ-DI and DAS28 ranged from 21.49 to 24.71, 14.01 to 16.52, 1.20 to 1.57 and 5.14 to 5.49, respectively. A trend for significant changes compared with placebo for ACR20, 50 and 70 responses was observed at doses of 3 mg twice daily or higher. ACR20 responses were achieved in 37.7% of patients receiving placebo, 49.3% of patients receiving 1 mg twice daily and 58.7 (at 15 mg bid) to 60.6% (at 5 mg bid) of patients at the remaining doses. The ACR50 responses were 17.4 (with placebo), 23.9 (at 1 mg bid) and, for the higher doses, ranged from 30.7 to 46.7%; the ACR70 responses were 5.8 (with placebo), 7.0 (at 1 mg bid) and, for the higher doses, ranged from 13.3 to 25.3%. HAQ-DI responses differed significantly from placebo (40.7%) at all CP-690550 doses (62.1% at 3 mg bid to 69.1% at 20 mg qd), and DAS28 remissions were significantly different from placebo (8.8%) at doses of 3 mg twice daily (32.1%), 10 mg twice daily (30.2%), 15 mg twice daily (37.7%) and 20 mg once daily (24.6%) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="974406"&gt;974406&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In an ongoing phase II, multicenter, open-label clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="4077"&gt;NCT00414661&lt;/ulink&gt;), patients with RA that had been recruited previously for other trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="2285"&gt;NCT00147498&lt;/ulink&gt;, n = 34; and &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="2322"&gt;NCT00413660&lt;/ulink&gt;, n = 95) were used to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of CP-690550 (5 mg po, bid) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="948312"&gt;948312&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the time of publication, treatment duration ranged from 9 to 397 days, with 40 patients receiving CP-690550 for 6 months. At 1- and 6-month trial visits, the mean DAS28 was 3.60 and 3.47, respectively, indicating that a dose of 5 mg twice daily exhibited efficacy in moderate-to-severe RA [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="948312"&gt;948312&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the time of publication, additional patients were being recruited for this trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="4077"&gt;NCT00414661&lt;/ulink&gt;).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Two further phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials had been completed in patients with RA at the time of publication. The first trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="7387"&gt;NCT00603512&lt;/ulink&gt;) was conducted in Japan to determine the efficacy and safety of CP-690550 (1, 3, 5 and 10 mg po, bid) combined with MTX over a 12-week period (n = 140). The second trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="5822"&gt;NCT00550446&lt;/ulink&gt;) was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of CP-690550 alone (1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 mg po, bid) compared with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14163"&gt;adalimumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (40 mg sc for 10 weeks) plus CP-690550 (presumably one of the five doses, started at week 12) over a 6-month period (n = 386). In both trials, the primary endpoints were ACR20 response rates at week 12, and secondary endpoints included ACR50, 70 and 90 responses, quality-of-life assessment and the incidence of adverse events. The first trial was completed in September 2008, and the second was completed in January 2009; no data were available for either trial at the time of publication. An additional phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="16190"&gt;NCT00687193&lt;/ulink&gt;) was to assess CP-690550 (1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 mg po, bid) for 12 weeks in patients with RA (n = 300) in Japan. The trial was to start in March 2009 and had similar endpoints as described above.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Transplant rejection&lt;br/&gt;In a phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="24692"&gt;NCT00106639&lt;/ulink&gt;), the efficacy of CP-690550 (15 and 30 mg po, bid) was compared with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; over a 6-month period in de novo renal transplant recipients (n = 61; 20 and 20 patients receiving 15 and 30 mg of CP-690550, respectively, and 21 patients receiving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt;) who received an IL-2 receptor antagonist, MMF (2 g/day) and steroids as induction therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986121"&gt;986121&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The protocol for patients receiving the 30-mg dose of CP-690550 was amended to reduce steroid use and discontinue MMF as a result of a high incidence of polyoma virus-associated neuropathy in this cohort. By 6 months post-transplant, the primary endpoint of biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred in one patient in the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; group, and in one and four patients in the 15- and 30-mg CP-690550 cohorts, respectively. After 6 months, there was no significant difference between the least squares mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR; as a measurement of renal acute rejection) of the three treatment groups (GFR = 76.9 +/- 10.0 and 72.8 +/- 14.7 ml/min in the 15- and 30-mg CP-690550 cohorts, respectively, compared with 77.4 +/- 12.6 ml/min with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt;). No graft losses, malignancies or deaths occurred over the 6-month post-transplant period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986121"&gt;986121&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At the time of publication, a phase II, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="24689"&gt;NCT00483756&lt;/ulink&gt;) was recruiting de novo renal transplant recipients (n = 300) to compare the coadministration of MMF and CP-690550 (15 mg po, bid for 1 to 3 or 1 to 6 months and then 10 mg po, bid for 4 to 12 or 7 to 12 months, respectively) with cyclosporine for 12 months. The primary endpoints would be GFR at 12 months and biopsy-proven acute rejection at 6 months, and secondary endpoints included GFR at 6 months, the pharmacokinetics of CP-690550 and mycophenolic acid, lymphocyte subsets and safety. The trial was expected to be completed in March 2010.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Two phase II, multicenter, open-label extension trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="40251"&gt;NCT00658359&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="37221"&gt;NCT00263328&lt;/ulink&gt;) were also active at the time of publication. &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="40251"&gt;NCT00658359&lt;/ulink&gt; was to follow renal transplant recipients (n = 300) who had participated in another trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="24689"&gt;NCT00483756&lt;/ulink&gt;) for an additional 2 years to monitor the safety and efficacy of MMF and CP-690550 (10 mg po, bid for 12 to 36 months) compared with cyclosporine; patients were being recruited at the time of publication, and the trial was expected to be completed in May 2012. &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="37221"&gt;NCT00263328&lt;/ulink&gt; was to follow renal transplant recipients (n = 54) who responded well in another trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="24692"&gt;NCT00106639&lt;/ulink&gt;) for 8 years to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of CP-690550 (15 and 30 mg po, bid) and MMF compared with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt;; the trial was expected to be completed in February 2014; patient recruitment had been completed at the time of publication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase II, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="24687"&gt;NCT00556257&lt;/ulink&gt;) was to compare CP-690550 (20 mg po, bid for 1 to 6 months and then 15 mg po, bid for 7 to 12 months) with cyclosporine in de novo renal transplant recipients; however the trial had been withdrawn prior to recruitment; no further details were available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Psoriasis&lt;br/&gt;At the time of publication, two phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials were recruiting patients with psoriasis. In the first trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="15874"&gt;NCT00678210&lt;/ulink&gt;), the safety and efficacy of CP-690550 (2, 5 and 15 mg po, bid for 12 weeks) was to be assessed in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis (n = 200). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 at week 12, and secondary endpoints included PASI 50 and 75 at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 (for PASI 50 only), 14 and 16, and the proportion of patients with a PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear'. The trial was expected to be completed in July 2009. In the second trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="36803"&gt;NCT00678561&lt;/ulink&gt;), patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (n = 98) were to receive topical CP-690550 (0.02, 0.2 and 2% qd or bid for 4 weeks) to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in this pilot trial. The primary endpoint was the target plaque severity score at week 4, and secondary endpoints included local toleration, safety laboratory assays, PGA of the target lesion and blood levels of the drug. The trial was expected to be completed in May 2009.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;br/&gt;At the time of publication, a phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="18497"&gt;NCT00615199&lt;/ulink&gt;) was recruiting patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (n = 150) to assess the safety and efficacy of CP-690550 (1, 5 and 15 mg po, bid). The primary endpoint would be a decrease in the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score of at least 70 points from baseline at week 4, and secondary endpoints included CDAI150 and 100, both at 4 weeks, and CDAI70 at weeks 1 and 2. The trial was expected to be completed in May 2009.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Ulcerative colitis&lt;br/&gt;At the time of publication, a phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="34619"&gt;NCT00787202&lt;/ulink&gt;) was planned in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (n = 192) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CP-690550 (0.5, 3, 10 and 15 mg po, bid). The primary endpoint would be clinical response, defined as a decrease from baseline Mayo score (a 12-point system assessing rectal bleeding, stool frequency, PGA and endoscopic appearance) of 3 points and at least 30%, accompanied by a decrease in the rectal bleeding score of at least 1 point at week 8. Secondary endpoints included endoscopic response and remission, improvement in quality of life, incidence and severity of adverse events, and pharmacokinetics. The trial was expected to be completed in August 2010.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Dry eye disease&lt;br/&gt;At the time of publication, a phase I/II, prospective, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="33733"&gt;NCT00784719&lt;/ulink&gt;) was ongoing to compare an ophthalmic topical solution of CP-690550 (low, medium, intermediate and high dose [no specific details provided], at least qd) with an ophthalmic topical solution of cyclosporine (0.5% at least qd) for 8 weeks in patients with dry eye disease (xerophthalmia; n = 412). The primary endpoints were the incidence of ocular and systemic adverse events, and secondary endpoints included tear break-up time, corneal and conjunctival staining, and a symptom questionnaire. The trial was expected to be completed in September 2009.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis&lt;br/&gt;At the time of publication, four phase II/III clinical trials were recruiting patients with RA. The first trial was a phase II/III, open-label, long-term follow-up trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="2329"&gt;NCT00413699&lt;/ulink&gt;) in patients who had participated in qualifying phase II trials, with patients (n = 560) to receive CP-690550 (5 mg po, bid; possibly reduced by 1 mg bid if required, to a minimum dose of 1 mg bid). The primary endpoints were the long-term safety and tolerability, and standard laboratory safety data. The secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the persistence of efficacy. The trial was expected to be completed in June 2009. In the second trial, a phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="39353"&gt;NCT00814307&lt;/ulink&gt;), patients with RA (n = 500) were to receive CP-690550 (5 and 10 mg po, bid for 6 months). The primary endpoints were ACR20 response and HAQ-DI at 3 months, and secondary endpoints included ACR20, 50 and 70 responses; DAS28 and HAQ-DI at all time points; SF-36 at 1, 3 and 6 months; and the incidence and severity of adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities. The trial was expected to be completed in November 2010. A third phase III, open-label trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="10896"&gt;NCT00661661&lt;/ulink&gt;) in Japan was to evaluate CP-690550 (5 mg po, bid for 2 years) in patients with RA (n = 240) from one of the phase II trials to confirm the safety of the drug following long-term administration (the primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints included ACR20, 50 and 70 responses, DAS and quality-of-life assessment at multiple time points. The trial was expected to be completed in December 2011. Finally, a further phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="46481"&gt;NCT00847613&lt;/ulink&gt;) was planned in patients with RA receiving background MTX (n = 750) to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of CP-690550 (5 and 10 mg po, bid for up to 2 years). Primary endpoints would include a comparison of the two doses for ACR20 response and evidence of preservation of joint structure at 6 months, and secondary endpoints would include a comparison of the two doses for ACR20, 50 and 70 responses and DAS28 at 2 years. The trial was expected to be completed in February 2012.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side effects and contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis&lt;br/&gt;In the phase I clinical trial in patients with RA (n = 12) receiving CP-690550 in combination with MTX, there were no reports of deaths, serious adverse events or discontinuations of treatment because of adverse events [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="987138"&gt;987138&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Of 34 adverse events reported, 7 were experienced by 5 patients receiving MTX alone, 15 by 6 patients receiving CP-690550 alone, and 12 by 5 patients receiving the combination treatment. Treatment-related adverse events were dizziness, disorientation, headache and hot flashes. Dosing of CP-690550 was briefly discontinued (for a maximum of 1 day) by two patients because of mild leg pain and a mild vascular period, respectively. No clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values were observed [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="987138"&gt;987138&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the phase IIa clinical trial in patients with RA (n = 264) receiving CP-690550 for 6 weeks, CP-690550 was well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986283"&gt;986283&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Dose-dependent increases in headache and nausea were the most common side effects. An infection rate of 30.4% was observed in both the 15- and 30-mg treatment groups, compared with 26.2% for placebo. A dose-dependent decrease in neutrophil counts was noted; three patients had counts of 1000 cells/mm3 (one in the 5-mg group and two in the 30-mg cohort). CP-690550 also dose-dependently increased mean serum creatinine levels to 0.04 to 0.06 mg/dl (an increase that was reversible), and decreased LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986283"&gt;986283&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The most common adverse events in the phase IIb clinical trial in patients with RA (n = 509) receiving stable background MTX were nausea (2.4%), headache (2.2%) and increased ALT (2.0%). No serious adverse events were observed in the placebo group, while 1 to 8% of patients receiving CP-690550 experienced serious adverse events; five dose-unrelated serious infections were reported [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="974406"&gt;974406&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A total of 160 adverse events (93 mild, 64 moderate and 3 severe) were reported in the interim data from the phase II clinical trial in patients with RA (n = 129) who had been recruited previously in phase IIa/b trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00147498 and NCT00413660) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="948312"&gt;948312&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The most common side effects were urinary tract infection (UTI) and diarrhea in eight and five patients, respectively. A total of nine patients withdrew from the trial (five because of a lack of efficacy and four because of side effects). Mean values for serum creatinine (0.88 mg/dl), absolute neutrophil count (5.09 cells/mm3) and hemoglobin (13.28 g/dl) remained within the normal limits after 6 months. The mean LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels at 6 months were 136.92 and 64.54 mg/dl, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="948312"&gt;948312&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Transplant rejection&lt;br/&gt;In the phase I clinical trial in stable renal transplant patients (n = 28) receiving CP-690550 and concomitant cyclosporine, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; or MMF, CP-690550 was well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="935893"&gt;935893&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986122"&gt;986122&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The most common side effects for the placebo and combined treatment groups were infections, such as UTI and HSV infection, in 3 out of 6 and 12 out of 22 patients, respectively; and gastrointestinal disturbances, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia and vomiting, in 2 out of 6 and 7 out of 22 patients, respectively. The majority of side effects were mild to moderate and could be managed with routine medical treatment. Severe side effects were observed in three patients receiving CP-690550, including a severe UTI and severe episode of gastroenteritis in one patient at a dose of 15 mg, a severe viral infection and severe episode of dehydration in one patient at 30 mg, and severe tinea versicolor in one patient at 15 mg. One patient receiving a dose of 30 mg discontinued treatment on day 27 because of herpes simplex ulcers of the palate. Compared with the placebo group, patients treated with CP-690550 had no changes in serum glucose levels, renal and hepatic function, blood pressure and heart rate or QTc interval. In patients treated with 15 and 30 mg of CP-690550 twice daily, a reversible mean 11% decrease in baseline nadir median hemoglobin was detected 14 days after the final dose. No treatment-related changes in neutrophils, total lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelets or monocytes were observed [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="935893"&gt;935893&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986122"&gt;986122&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the subgroup analysis in patients (n = 8) receiving the higher dose, six patients experienced a mean decrease in hemoglobin of 8% by day 29. The most common side effects were dizziness (n = 3) and oral lesions caused by a reactivation of HSV infection (n = 2) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986119"&gt;986119&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the phase IIa clinical trial in de novo renal transplant recipients (n = 61) receiving CP-690550 or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; over a 6-month period, the most frequent side effects were gastrointestinal disorders: these effects occurred in 11 patients in the 15-mg CP-690550 group (5 cases of constipation, 4 diarrhea, 4 dyspepsia and 2 nausea); 13 in the 30-mg CP-690550 group (6 constipation, 0 diarrhea, 4 dyspepsia and 4 nausea); and 12 in the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; group (5 constipation, 5 diarrhea, 2 dyspepsia and 3 nausea). General disorders (not defined) were also experienced in 11 and 10 patients in the 15- and 30-mg CP-690550 groups, respectively, and in 11 patients in the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; group. Moreover, peripheral edema was observed in four, five and seven patients in the 15- and 30-mg CP-690550 groups and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; groups, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986121"&gt;986121&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A total of 12 patients receiving the 30-mg dose of CP-690550 acquired infections (4 had CMV disease and 5 had UTIs) during the trial, compared with 8 (2 CMV, 0 UTI) and 5 (0 CMV, 4 UTI) patients in the 15-mg and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; cohorts, respectively. The investigators attributed the relatively high rate of infection in the 30-mg dose group to over-immunosuppression of that dose in combination with the 2-g/day dose of MMF. At 6 months, patients in the two CP-690550 groups experienced a 15 to 27% increase in serum lipid levels (including triglycerides and total, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol) compared with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt;. However, there were no significant differences in the treatment groups in hemoglobin or white blood cell counts at that time point. Treatment was discontinued by two, three and seven patients in the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; and 15- and 30-mg CP-690550 groups, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986121"&gt;986121&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Psoriasis&lt;br/&gt;In the phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers with psoriatic lesions (n = 59), CP-690550 was well tolerated during the trial and after a 28-day follow-up period, with 58 patients completing the trial [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968745"&gt;968745&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The most frequent side effects were mild headache and nausea. The 50-mg dose caused a slight reduction in neutrophil counts, an effect that was reversed during the follow-up period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="968745"&gt;968745&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Patent summary&lt;/subtitle&gt;Pfizer first claimed CP-690550 in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="WO109657"&gt;WO-0142246&lt;/ulink&gt;, the third in a series of three PCT applications disclosing new pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds.

One member of this class of drugs is MTX, which has a poor toxicity profile [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="993062"&gt;993062&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Other DMARD members include the biological agents &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14163"&gt;adalimumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7274"&gt;anakinra&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4567"&gt;etanercept&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2888"&gt;abatacept&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6850"&gt;infliximab&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6736"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt;, all of which are administered by intravenous or subcutaneous injection. An orally available therapy for RA would be advantageous, as patients tend to prefer this route of administration. Preclinical studies in rodent models of RA revealed that CP-690550 dose-dependently reduced the clinical and histological signs of joint inflammation, including damage to cartilage and bone. These findings led to clinical trials of CP-690550 as a DMARD. In phase II trials in patients with moderate-to-severe RA, oral CP-690550 was effective in treating the signs and symptoms of RA, improving pain, improving patient function and health status, and reducing disease activity and remission rates.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Conventional treatments for transplant rejection include steroids, cyclosporine, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt;, MMF and enteric-coated mycophenolic acid. Side effects of steroid treatment include body disfigurement, growth retardation in children, mood changes, insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, infections and fractures [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="993063"&gt;993063&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Toxicity associated with calcineurin inhibitors include nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and the development of neoplasia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="611969"&gt;611969&lt;/ulink&gt;], while mycophenolic-based therapies are mainly associated with gastrointestinal adverse events, but are also known to increase susceptibility for infections and the possible development of lymphoma and other neoplasia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="610836"&gt;610836&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In vivo findings have demonstrated that CP-690550 has the potential to provide sufficient immunosuppression to prevent transplant rejection without causing the severe side effects that are observed with existing therapies. Data from in vivo murine models of transplantation indicated that CP-690550 could suppress a strong allogenic response. Other JAK3 inhibitors, such as AG-490, WHI-P131 and WHI-P154 (all three are commercially available for research), have been described [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986123"&gt;986123&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986124"&gt;986124&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986126"&gt;986126&lt;/ulink&gt;], but these compounds do not possess the same degree of potency and selectivity as CP-690550. Furthermore, only CP-690550 has demonstrated efficacy in nonhuman primate models of transplantation. Moreover, 3-month survival of kidney allografts in cynomolgus monkeys was achieved by a well-tolerated dose of CP-690550 that produced drug exposures consistent with cellular potencies measured in vitro and resulted in complete hemoglobin recovery.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Data from a phase I clinical trial confirmed the efficacy of oral CP-690550 in stable renal transplant patients. Moreover, the safety and tolerability of CP-690550 was acceptable at doses of up to 30 mg twice daily in combination with MMF (plus calcineurin inhibitors in some patients) for 28 days. The 6-month findings of the phase II clinical trial in kidney transplant recipients indicated that a calcineurin inhibitor-free regimen of CP-690550 (15 mg) and MMF (2 g/day) could be used to prevent acute rejection, although a higher dose of CP-690550 (30 mg) in combination with MMF appeared to cause over-immunosuppression. Additionally, the phase II trial revealed no significant difference in GFR between patients treated with CP-690550 and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt; after 6 months. This finding suggests that there was no therapeutic advantage of using CP-690550 in a &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4510"&gt;tacrolimus&lt;/ulink&gt;-free regimen in this trial. However, more data from ongoing trials need to be disclosed, and further large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials need to be conducted to fully understand this hypothesis. Moreover, the published phase II data for renal transplantation were limited to one abstract at the time of publication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Drugs used to treat psoriasis include topical treatments, which are somewhat inconvenient because of time-consuming applications and the stickiness of such topical formulations. Systemic biological agents, such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4567"&gt;etanercept&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14163"&gt;adalimumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6850"&gt;infliximab&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, are also used in the treatment of psoriasis and, similar to RA therapy, need to be administered by injection. CP-690550 demonstrated efficacy in a phase I clinical trial in psoriasis, resulting in improved mPASI and PGA scores after 14 days, and a reversal of hyperplasia and other psoriatic pathologies. However, at the time of publication, clinical data for the drug in the treatment of psoriasis were limited to abstract publications, and phase II trials were ongoing.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;CP-690550 was generally well tolerated in all reported clinical trials. The highest stage of development that CP-690550 had reached at the time of publication was phase II/III trials in patients with RA. CP-690550 was also in phase II trials for transplant rejection, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and a phase I/II trial for dry eye disease.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Only two other JAK3 inhibitors have reached clinical development: &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="59451"&gt;VX-509&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20739"&gt;Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;) for the potential treatment of inflammatory diseases and in phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers (Clinical Trials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="35496"&gt;NCT00789126&lt;/ulink&gt;); and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="55538"&gt;R-348&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="25471"&gt;Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;) for the potential treatment of autoimmune disease, such as RA and psoriasis, and in phase I trials in healthy males [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="866199"&gt;866199&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Thus, if JAK3 inhibitors prove to be effective in treating immune diseases, CP-690550 has the advantage of being at the most advanced stage in development and therefore could reach the market first. Additionally, the only immunosuppressant agent for transplant rejection to reach the clinic is a capsule formulation of the peptide immunosuppressant calcineurin inhibitor &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="24844"&gt;voclosporin&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="22374"&gt;Isotechnika Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;), which is in phase III trials for the potential treatment of psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="815205"&gt;815205&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="946660"&gt;946660&lt;/ulink&gt;] and in phase II for the prevention of organ rejection after transplantation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="911747"&gt;911747&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Targeting JAK3 and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway appears to be a viable approach to achieve immunosuppression. The production of safe and effective inhibitors of specific tyrosine kinases has progressed from hypothesis to reality following the successful development of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11460"&gt;imatinib&lt;/ulink&gt; for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="656346"&gt;656346&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="986127"&gt;986127&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The available preclinical and clinical data strongly support the use of CP-690550 to produce sufficient immunosuppression to prevent organ transplant rejection and to treat autoimmune diseases, such as RA and psoriasis, in the absence of the severe side effects commonly observed with currently available immunosuppressants, particularly in the transplantation setting. The oral administration of CP-690550 could also be advantageous compared with topical and injectable therapies, particularly in the treatment of RA and psoriasis. CP-690550 could herald the beginning of a new generation of safe and effective immunosuppressive therapies with a convenient dosing schedule, and the drug might be the first JAK3 inhibitor to reach the market. Analysts have predicted sales of US$ 125 million for CP-690550 in the anticipated launch year of 2011, with estimated peak sales of US$ 1.5 billion [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference"
