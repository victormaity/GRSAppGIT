Further clinical data from post hoc analysis of pooled data were presented at the same conference. Overall, 50% of patients attained PASI 100 responses at 14 weeks for brodalumab and 44 weeks for ustekinumab. At 52 weeks, the cumulative incidence of PASI 100 response was 76 and 52% with brodalumab and ustekinumab, respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). In the brodalumab and ustekinumab groups, 76 and 58% of systemic/biologic naive patients achieved PASI 100 by week 52.

At week 12, in biologic-experienced and bio-naive patients, proportion of patients achieving PASI 100 with brodalumab and ustekinumab was 39.5 and 40.9, and 17.0 and 21.1%, respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001). In biologic-naive, biologic-experienced, previous biologic-successful and previous biologic-unsuccessful patients, PASI 100 was achieved by 40.9, 39.5, 45.7 and 32.0% of patients, respectively, receiving brodalumab, and by 21.1, 17.0, 20.6 and 11.3% of patients, respectively, receiving ustekinumab; sPGA score 0 or 1 was achieved by 81.0, 74.0, 74.5 and 73.3% of patients, respectively, receiving brodalumab, and by 61.9, 50.9, 55.7 and 43.5% of patients, respectively, receiving ustekinumab [&lt;ulink linkID="1906576" linkType="Reference"&gt;1906576&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further pooled data comparing the onset of response for brodalumab versus ustekinumab were presented at the same conference. For both sPGA success and PASI75, statistically significant differences were seen from week 1 (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and maintained through to week 12. Both sPGA success and PASI-75 were achieved by 3.5% of brodalumab-treated patients as early as week 1, compared with 0.7 and 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively. For brodalumab- and ustekinumab-treated patients, time for 25% of patients to achieve sPGA was 2.49 and 5.55 weeks, respectively, while to achieve PASI75 was 2.14 and 4.77 weeks, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1906612" linkType="Reference"&gt;1906612&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2017, further data were presented at the 26th Annual EADV Congress in Geneva, Switzerland. At week 52, European patients treated with brodalumab 210 mg achieved significantly (P&amp;lt;0.05) higher proportion of psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 75, PASI100, static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) (clear skin) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 0/1 (no effect of psoriasis on health-related quality of life [HRQoL]) responses compared with European ustekinumab-treated patients. In European and non-European patients treated with brodalumab versus ustekinumab, PASI100 was 62.4 versus 34.5, respectively, and 49.0 versus 26.4%, respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.001); and sPGA 0 responses was   62.4 versus 34.5, respectively, and 48.5 versus 26.4%, respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.001) [&lt;ulink linkID="2014654" linkType="Reference"&gt;2014654&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. Step wise increase in clinical benefit ratios of brodalumab versus ustekinumab for PASI75, 90, and 100 (1.28, 1.42, 1.68, respectively) was observed. In patients treated with brodalumab, cumulative benefits for PASI75, 90, and 100 were 78.1, 65.7, and 44.3%, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2014631" linkType="Reference"&gt;2014631&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In February 2018, further  results were presented at the 76th annual AAD meeting in San Diego, CA.  Brodalumab (210 mg) decreased the NAPSI score from 9.6 at baseline to 1.6 in the most affected nail at week 52, and was associated with lower NAPSI score than ustekinumab and placebo; results for ustekinumab reduced the mean NAPSI score of 9.9 at baseline to 2.4 at week 52 [&lt;ulink linkID="2006026" linkType="Reference"&gt;2006026&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar clinical data were presented at the same conference [&lt;ulink linkID="2006611" linkType="Reference"&gt;2006611&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. Of those who achieved PASI 100 at week 12, PASI 90 to &amp;lt;100 was achieved by 10% of patients, and 72% either maintained at or improved to a response of PASI 100 at 52 weeks. It was demonstrated that long-treatment of brodalumab maintained and continued improvement of skin clearance [&lt;ulink linkID="2006587" linkType="Reference"&gt;2006587&lt;/ulink&gt;].  At the same conference, further data were presented. At long-term extension, in continuous brodalumab 210 mg q2w and ustekinumab/brodalumab 210 mg q2w treatment group, PASI75 was achieved by 93.8 and 88.9% of patients at week 52, and 90.3 and 88.7% of patient at week 120, respectively; PASI90 was achieved by 86.2 and 69.9% of patients at week 52, and 77.4 and 81% of patients at week 120, respectively; and PASI 100 was achieved by 63.4 and 42.3% of patients at week 52, and 62.7 and 61.6% of patients at week 120, respectively. Between week 52 and 120, patients in both treatment groups achieved comparable PASI 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 response rates [&lt;ulink linkID="2006583" linkType="Reference"&gt;2006583&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further long-term efficacy data were presented at the same conference. Treatment with brodalumab for &amp;gt; 2 years demonstrated consistent safety and sustained efficacy; and PASI 100 and sPGA 0/1 was achieved by &amp;gt; 60 and &amp;gt; 79% of patients, respectively. Frequently reported TEAEs included arthralgia, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, myalgia, injection site reactions, influenza, neutropenia, Tinea infections, conjunctivitis and Candida infections [&lt;ulink linkID="2006571" linkType="Reference"&gt;2006571&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2018, findings from a post hoc analysis in a subgroup of moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients (n = 590) who had prior exposure to multiple biologic agents including ustekinumab were presented at the 76th AAD Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA. At week 16, PASI 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 response rate was achieved by 54.8, 42.9 and 26.2% of patients who were rescued with brodalumab 210 mg q2w after inadequate response at week 16; 55.6, 20.4 and 1.9% of patients who continued on ustekinumab after inadequate response following week 16; and 81.4, 59.3 and 35.6% of patients who had been not rescued due to adequate response at week 16, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2006631" linkType="Reference"&gt;2006631&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further clinical data were presented at the same conference. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75/90/100 and sPGA 0/1 response rates were increased from week 12 to 52 in 124 patients who were rescued with brodalumab 210, q2w at week 16 (72.6/58.1/36.3 versus 61.7/25.5/5.4 and 60.5 versus 29.5%, respectively) compared with 149 patients who continued on ustekinumab after week 16 following an inadequate response [&lt;ulink linkID="2006495" linkType="Reference"&gt;2006495&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further clinical data were presented at the same conference. Brodalumab was observed to be associated with higher rates of PASI 100 relative to ustekinumab in obese and nonobese patients. TEAEs were found to be comparable in brodalumab-treated obese (60.5%) and nonobese patients (54.6%) with similar rates to those in ustekinumab-treated obese (58.2%) and nonobese patients (54.9%) [&lt;ulink linkID="2006492" linkType="Reference"&gt;2006492&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In March 2019, further data were presented at the 77th AAD Annual Meeting in Washington DC.

The primary endpoint was the percentage of Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) 40 in axSpA subjects at week 16. The study was to complete in September 2019 [&lt;ulink linkID="1921561" linkType="Reference"&gt;1921561&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1921355" linkType="Reference"&gt;1921355&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2019, topline data were presented at the 2019 EULAR Annual European Congress of Rheumatology in Madrid, Spain. Brodalumab met the primary endpoint, achieving a greater ASAS40 response rate at week 16 compared with placebo (35/80 versus 19/79). For the secondary endpoints, the drug showed numerical improvements over placebo, which did not reach statistical significance. The most common adverse event was nasopharyngitis (11.1 versus 10.3%). None of the patients experienced suicidal behavior [&lt;ulink linkID="2162450" linkType="Reference"&gt;2162450&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2164835" linkType="Reference"&gt;2164835&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2165080" linkType="Reference"&gt;2165080&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By April 2015, Amgen was planning a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study, with an open label extension (&lt;ulink linkID="228156" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02429882&lt;/ulink&gt;; 20101228; 2014-003701-15), to evaluate brodalumab in subjects (expected n = 180) with axial spondyloarthritis in the UK. At that time, the trial was planned to be initiated in June 2015 and complete in   July 2022; however, the trial was withdrawn prior to patient enrollment in May 2015 following Amgen's decision to discontinue codevelopment of brodalumab [&lt;ulink linkID="1698196" linkType="Reference"&gt;1698196&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Asthma&lt;/subtitle&gt;In April 2015, Amgen reported that a phase II trial (probably NCT01902290) in asthma had been terminated for futility at interim results [&lt;ulink linkID="1653583" linkType="Reference"&gt;1653583&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By October 2013, a phase IIb asthma trial had been initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="1496863" linkType="Reference"&gt;1496863&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2013, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="164375" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01902290&lt;/ulink&gt;; 20120141, 2012-003351-11) was initiated in the US, EU, Taiwan, Canada, Korea, New Zealand and Puerto Rico, in subjects (expected n = 566) with inadequately controlled asthma and high bronchodilator reversibility to evaluate the safety and efficacy of drug compared to placebo. At that time, the trial was expected to complete in February 2015 [&lt;ulink linkID="1586396" linkType="Reference"&gt;1586396&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By November 2010, Amgen had initiated a phase II trial  (&lt;ulink linkID="70144" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01199289&lt;/ulink&gt;, 20090203) in patients with Asthma in Canada and the US. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study would evaluate dosing as well as safety and efficacy. The trial was expected to be complete in July 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1146585" linkType="Reference"&gt;1146585&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2013, data presented at the 2013 AAAAI meeting in San Antonio, TX, showed no evidence of a treatment effect in the overall study population, but showed a clinically meaningful response in subjects with high bronchodilator reversibility; further study in these subjects was warranted [&lt;ulink linkID="1382770" linkType="Reference"&gt;1382770&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2013, similar data were presented at the 2013 ECAAI-WAO meeting in Milan, Italy. Brodalumab, administered at 140, 210, and 280 mg in the patient subgroup, was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported [&lt;ulink linkID="1444194" linkType="Reference"&gt;1444194&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1443045" linkType="Reference"&gt;1443045&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/subtitle&gt;By June 2010,  a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase  II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="67650" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01150890&lt;/ulink&gt;, 20090072) was planned in subjects (expected n= 216) with Crohn's disease. The trial was expected to begin in July 2010 and was expected to be completed in March 2012. In October 2010, the trial was ongoing in patients (given intravenous doses of the drug); however, by September 2011, the trial had been terminated  [&lt;ulink linkID="1111880" linkType="Reference"&gt;1111880&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2012, data were presented at DDW 2012, in San Diego, CA. The trial was terminated early following an independent data review of unblinded safety data from 117 patients, which identified an imbalance in worsening Crohn's disease in the active treatment groups. The remission rates for brodalumab evaluated using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) were not significant compared with placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1292188" linkType="Reference"&gt;1292188&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In November 2012, data from  a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in rheumatoid arthritis patients (n = 252) were presented at the at the ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting in Washington, DC. The 12-week ACR 50 response rates (primary endpoint) were 16, 16 and 10% at the 70, 140 and 210-mg dose levels, compared with 13% in the placebo group; no significant difference observed when compared with the placebo group [&lt;ulink linkID="1342535" linkType="Reference"&gt;1342535&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2009, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending multiple-dose phase I/II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="30020" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00771030&lt;/ulink&gt;; 20070264) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of brodalumab in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (expected n = 94) began in the US, Canada and Mexico.

In November 2012, data from 40 patients from phase Ib portion were presented at the at the ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting in Washington, DC.  Brodalumab-treatment resulted in receptor occupancy on circulating leukocytes as well as caused IL-17 receptor signaling inhibition. The magnitude and duration of mean receptor occupancy increased dose-dependently. On day 85, the ACR 20 response rate was 36.7% in the brodalumab group and 22% in the placebo group; ACR50 or ACR70 responses were observed in fewer brodalumab and placebo-recipients [&lt;ulink linkID="1343202" linkType="Reference"&gt;1343202&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By February 2008, a single-dose phase I study in healthy volunteers had commenced [&lt;ulink linkID="882176" linkType="Reference"&gt;882176&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><AdditionalInformation><displayLabel>Additional Information</displayLabel><value>&lt;AdditionalInformation&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2014, the EMA's Pediatric Committee (PDCO) adopted an opinion agreeing a pediatric investigation plan for brodalumab for the treatment of  psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkID="1592783" linkType="Reference"&gt;1592783&lt;/ulink&gt;].
