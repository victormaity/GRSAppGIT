By August 2013, 76 patients had been enrolled and the Independent Data Monitoring Committee had recommended to continue the study, after the two interim safety analyses condcuted at enrollment of 20 and 52 patients, respectively. At that time, an interim efficacy analysis was planned [&lt;ulink linkID="1463437" linkType="Reference"&gt;1463437&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By   November 2013, 83 patients had been enrolled in the open-label trial and the Independent Data Monitoring Committee had recommended to continue the study, after the three interim safety analyses condcuted at enrollment of 20, 40 and 60 patients, respectively. At that time, interim efficacy analysis was planned in the half of 2014 and data  were expected to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, to be held in Chicago, IL, in June, 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1499985" linkType="Reference"&gt;1499985&lt;/ulink&gt;]; by March 2014, the first three interim safety analyses had been conducted after 20, 40 and 60 patients. At that time, 96 out of planned 102 patients had been randomized. An additional interim safety analysis for 80 patients was expected to be performed shortly [&lt;ulink linkID="1540977" linkType="Reference"&gt;1540977&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2014, enrollment was almost complete with 103 patients randomized [&lt;ulink linkID="1557594" linkType="Reference"&gt;1557594&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By November 2014, review of the safety results of 80 patients was completed. At that time, IDMC review on the first 100 patients was expected in the first quarter of 2015. The enrollment was expected to completed by the end of the year and at that time, 112 out of 115 children have been randomized [&lt;ulink linkID="1612223" linkType="Reference"&gt;1612223&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In February 2015, the IDMC recommended to continue the trial as planned atfer its final safety review on 100 patients. The efficacy 	outcome was based on audiometric results which would be evaluated continuously as each child reaches the age of 3.5 years [&lt;ulink linkID="1630648" linkType="Reference"&gt;1630648&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2015, clinical data were presented at the 51st ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL. At the end of treatment, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease were achieved by 44, 3 and 2 treated with cisplatin and 52, 4 and 0 patients treated with cisplatin + sodium thiosulfate. Only one patient died in the cisplatin group [&lt;ulink linkID="1664003" linkType="Reference"&gt;1664003&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2015, the company expected to complete the second and last protocol-specified interim analysis on 	 efficacy in the first half of 2016, and final results were to be reported in 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1712774" linkType="Reference"&gt;1712774&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2016, further data from the trial were presented at the 107th AACR Annual Meeting in New Orleans, LA, USA. After four pre-operative chemotherapy cycles, 73, 18, and 9 and 67, 25, and 4% of patients achieved partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in the cisplatin alone and cisplatin + sodium thiosulfate treatment groups, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1755179" linkType="Reference"&gt;1755179&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2016, interim 2-year data were presented at ASCO, held in Chicago IL. Median follow-up was 34 months, and provisional 2-year event-free survival was  86.3% for cisplatin alone,  and 89.0% for cisplatin plus STS; overall survival at 2-years was 91.4 and 97.7% for cisplatin alone and cisplatin plus STS, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1769681" linkType="Reference"&gt;1769681&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2016, interim results from the trial (expected n= 109) were presented at the 48th Annual Congress of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) meeting held in Dublin, Ireland. The combination of cisplatin plus STS was   well tolerated. Provisional 2 year event free survival (EFS) for cisplatin was 82.4% and for cisplatin plus STS was 82.6%. Overall Survival (OS) at 2 years for cisplatin was 91.9% and for cisplatin plus STS was 97.9%. No difference was observed in  EFS and OS at 2 years for cisplatin alone compared with cisplatin plus STS. Complete remission at last follow-up was 92% for cisplatin  and cisplatin plus STS group was 94%. There was no evidence of tumor protection. Final audiometry primary end point  results would be available at the end of 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1865994" linkType="Reference"&gt;1865994&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In May 2017, initial results were expected in the fourth quarter of 2017 [&lt;ulink linkID="1932779" linkType="Reference"&gt;1932779&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2017, data from the trial demonstrated that the drug significantly reduced the incidence of cisplatin-induced hearing loss without any reported activity of tumor protection. The combination of cisplatin plus STS was well tolerated. The three year EFS for cisplatin was 80.4% and for cisplatin plus STS was 81.9%. The OS at three years for cisplatin was 92.3% and for cisplatin plus STS was 98.9%. Treatment failure defined as PD at four cycles was equivalent in both arms. Among the first 94 evaluable patients, hearing loss occurred in 65.9% of patients treated with cisplatin and in 38.0% of patients treated with the combination of cisplatin +STS, corresponded to a relative risk of 0.57 (P=0.0069) [&lt;ulink linkID="1962090" linkType="Reference"&gt;1962090&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2017, data were presented at the 49th Congress of the International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) 2017 Meeting. Data demonstrated that, among the 99 evaluable patients, hearing loss occurred in 67% of patients treated with cisplatin and in 37.0% of patients treated with the combination of cisplatin +STS, corresponded to a relative risk of 0.56 (P=0.0033), which was the primary endpoint successfully met. Furthermore, the three year EFS for cisplatin was 78.8% and for cisplatin plus STS was 82.1%. The OS at three years for cisplatin was 92.3% and for cisplatin plus STS was 98.2%. Overall the drug was well-tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1971170" linkType="Reference"&gt;1971170&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2018, the trial was completed  [&lt;ulink linkID="2047128" linkType="Reference"&gt;2047128&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, data from the trial were published. The SIOPEL 6 study met the primary endpoint. The drug protected children from hearing loss after chemotherapy. A total of 109 children were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin plus sodium thiosulfate (57 children) or cisplatin alone (52).  Hearing loss of grade 1 or higher occurred in 18 of 55 children (33%) in the cisplatin–sodium thiosulfate group, as compared with 29 of 46 (63%) in the cisplatin-alone group, and indicated a 48% lower incidence of hearing loss in the cisplatin–sodium thiosulfate group. The addition of sodium thiosulfate, administered 6h after cisplatin chemotherapy, resulted in a lower incidence of cisplatin-induced hearing loss among children with standard-risk hepatoblastoma  [&lt;ulink linkID="2047054" linkType="Reference"&gt;2047054&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2047129" linkType="Reference"&gt;2047129&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="2047379" linkType="Reference"&gt;2047379&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2000, OHSU published data showing that administration of STS at 2 or 4 h following an infusion of &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; reduces hearing loss in patients with osmotic blood-brain barrier opening for treatment of brain tumors [&lt;ulink linkID="494687" linkType="reference"&gt;494687&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were published in March 2001.

Sodium thiosulfate also decreased carboplatin-induced ototoxicity in a guinea pig model, as determined by electrophysiological measurements and analysis of inner ear outer hair cell numbers. Protection was found when STS was administered up to 8 h subsequent to carboplatin but not 24 h after carboplatin. In a rat model of osmotic blood brain barrier disruption (BBBD), STS was neurotoxic when given immediately after BBBD, but not when given 60 min after BBBD, when the barrier was reestablished.
