The drug was indicated for  the treatment  of chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in systemic therapy or phototherapy candidates aged 18 years or over  [&lt;ulink linkID="510537" linkType="Reference"&gt;510537&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="519228" linkType="Reference"&gt;519228&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="528375" linkType="Reference"&gt;528375&lt;/ulink&gt;].     However, beginning in April 2009, efalizumab was withdrawn from markets worldwide due to an  increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)  [&lt;ulink linkID="999223" linkType="Reference"&gt;999223&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1022136" linkType="Reference"&gt;1022136&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2003, Genentech and XOMA launched efalizumab in the US [&lt;ulink linkID="519228" linkType="reference"&gt;519228&lt;/ulink&gt;]; the drug was marketed for 5.5 years but was withdrawn from the US market in April 2009 due to  increased risk of PML  [&lt;ulink linkID="999214" linkType="Reference"&gt;999214&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="999223" linkType="Reference"&gt;999223&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2004, Serono launched Raptiva in Germany [&lt;ulink linkID="562680" linkType="Reference"&gt;562680&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Germany and EU-wide withdrawal began in June 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="1016243" linkType="Reference"&gt;1016243&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Genentech in partnership with Merck Serono, was also developing the drug  for the potential prevention of transplant rejection [&lt;ulink linkID="357738" linkType="Reference"&gt;357738&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="983719" linkType="Reference"&gt;983719&lt;/ulink&gt;].  By May 2007, a phase I/II trial of efalizumab in renal transplant patients had been initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="867708" linkType="Reference"&gt;867708&lt;/ulink&gt;]; the study was ongoing in July 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="925270" linkType="Reference"&gt;925270&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2008, a phase II/III trial of efalizumab in renal transplant patients was slated to start in September 2008. However, by March 2009, the study had been withdrawn prior to recruitment and it was assumed that development in this indication had been discontinued   [&lt;ulink linkID="934954" linkType="Reference"&gt;934954&lt;/ulink&gt;].    &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Genentech issued a warning letter in July 2005 regarding the occurrence of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in efalizumab-treated patients [&lt;ulink linkID="614005" linkType="Reference"&gt;614005&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2008, a Dear Doctor letter was issued by Genentech to inform prescribers of a fatal case of PML in a patient treated with efalizumab for 4 years [&lt;ulink linkID="948256" linkType="Reference"&gt;948256&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="948561" linkType="Reference"&gt;948561&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="952510" linkType="Reference"&gt;952510&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="964419" linkType="Reference"&gt;964419&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2008, a boxed warning highlighting the risk of bacterial sepsis, viral meningitis, invasive fungal disease, PML and other opportunistic infections was added to the labeling [&lt;ulink linkID="953280" linkType="Reference"&gt;953280&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At that time, Merck Serono was working with the EMEA and other regulatory agencies to update product information and determine whether further action was needed [&lt;ulink linkID="956170" linkType="Reference"&gt;956170&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2008, a second Dear Doctor letter was issued following another death  from PML [&lt;ulink linkID="964419" linkType="Reference"&gt;964419&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In February 2009, the EMEA recommended suspension of marketing of the drug, following the deaths  from PML. Following the  proposal the FDA  issued a a public health advisory noting that by that time, three people had died from PML [&lt;ulink linkID="985600" linkType="Reference"&gt;985600&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="985588" linkType="Reference"&gt;985588&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The antibody was also previously under development for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [&lt;ulink linkID="489184" linkType="reference"&gt;489184&lt;/ulink&gt;] and psoriatic arthritis (PsA)  [&lt;ulink linkID="528169" linkType="reference"&gt;528169&lt;/ulink&gt;].

XOMA stated that the unexpectedly fast enrollment of patients into a pivotal trial meant that patients in the study almost all used the XOMA-produced drug and not that manufactured at commercial scale by Genentech. When the FDA came to examine the data it was not convinced that the two molecules produced by the companies were the same and so requested additional data. XOMA and Genentech then conducted a pharmacokinetic trial [&lt;ulink linkID="424455" linkType="Reference"&gt;424455&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="452043" linkType="Reference"&gt;452043&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2002, pharmacokinetic data were disclosed, demonstrating  that the Genentech-produced material and XOMA-produced material did not achieve predefined statistical definition for comparability [&lt;ulink linkID="446135" linkType="Reference"&gt;446135&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="450668" linkType="Reference"&gt;450668&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="442492" linkType="Reference"&gt;442492&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2002, Genentech and XOMA submitted a BLA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkID="474931" linkType="Reference"&gt;474931&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="476351" linkType="Reference"&gt;476351&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="480210" linkType="Reference"&gt;480210&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2003, the FDA's Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee voted unanimously to recommend approval of the BLA [&lt;ulink linkID="504420" linkType="Reference"&gt;504420&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2003, the FDA approved efalizumab [&lt;ulink linkID="510537" linkType="Reference"&gt;510537&lt;/ulink&gt;], and in November 2003, the drug was launched in the US [&lt;ulink linkID="519228" linkType="Reference"&gt;519228&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2009, due to increased risk of PML, Genentech  voluntarily withdrew efalizumab from the US market [&lt;ulink linkID="999214" linkType="Reference"&gt;&lt;/ulink&gt;&lt;ulink linkID="999214" linkType="Reference"&gt;999214&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="999223" linkType="Reference"&gt;999223&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2003, Serono filed an MAA with the EMEA for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. In March 2004, Swissmedic approved efalizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults [&lt;ulink linkID="527465" linkType="Reference"&gt;527465&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Efalizumab had been launched in Switzerland by October 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="562680" linkType="Reference"&gt;562680&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2004, Serono received a positive opinion from the EU CHMP recommending approval of efalizumab [&lt;ulink linkID="546389" linkType="Reference"&gt;546389&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="547965" linkType="Reference"&gt;547965&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2004, the MAA was approved in the EU [&lt;ulink linkID="560744" linkType="Reference"&gt;560744&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2004, efalizumab was launched in Germany, Denmark, the UK, Sweden and Austria [&lt;ulink linkID="562680" linkType="Reference"&gt;562680&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="566628" linkType="Reference"&gt;566628&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2009, the EMEA recommended suspension of the drug following deaths from PML. The CHMP   recommended that no new prescriptions should be issued and that prescribers review patients currently being treated with efalizumab, with a view to replacing it. At that time, the decision was under review by the EC [&lt;ulink linkID="985600" linkType="Reference"&gt;985600&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2009, Merck  Serono requested that the MAA was withdrawn, and in June 2009, the EMEA agreed to the recall of efalizumab from wholesalers, pharmacies and hospitals [&lt;ulink linkID="1016243" linkType="Reference"&gt;1016243&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Rest of the world&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Canada&lt;/subtitle&gt;In January 2008, the drug was launched in Canada [&lt;ulink linkID="874036" linkType="Reference"&gt;874036&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however in February 2009, the drug was withdrawn from the Canadian market on the advice of Health Canada [&lt;ulink linkID="986220" linkType="Reference"&gt;986220&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Latin America&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2004, Serono received approval in Argentina and efalizumab was launched by October 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="547965" linkType="Reference"&gt;547965&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="562680" linkType="Reference"&gt;562680&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2004, efalizumab was also launched in Brazil  [&lt;ulink linkID="566628" linkType="Reference"&gt;566628&lt;/ulink&gt;].

The subjects were to receive efalizumab (1.0 mg/kg) for 168 days. The primary endpoint was a measure is the proportion of subjects with a PGA rating of clear, almost clear or mild at Day 84. The study was expected to be completed in July 2007 and was still recruiting in May 2007 [&lt;ulink linkID="935014" linkType="Reference"&gt;935014&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2005, an observational phase IV trial (NCT00096928; RESPONSE; ACD3101g) was initiated in subjects (expected n = 5500) with chronic moderate-to-severe psoriasis in the US. The primary endpoint was to compare outcomes and safety events in efalizumab and non-efalizumab patients.

The subjects were to receive sc efalizumab once-weekly for the 12-week period. The study had been completed by March 2007 [&lt;ulink linkID="887883" linkType="Reference"&gt;887883&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2004, Serono reported results from the CLEAR trial, the first randomized placebo-controlled study  of efalizumab conducted outside of the US. The results of the trial demonstrated the compound to be safe and efficacious in patients whose psoriasis could not be controlled by, were intolerant to or were contraindicated to other available systemic therapies. The results  were also consistent with the results from a  previously conducted trial in a moderate-to-severe population.  In the 793 patient multicenter study, 31.4% of patients treated with  efalizumab once a week for a period of 12 weeks showed a 75% or greater improvement in their Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) score versus 4.2% of patients on placebo. In addition 53.7% achieved 50% or greater PASI score improvement (PASI 50), versus 14.4% in the placebo group. These data were also were presented at the EADV (European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology) Congress in Budapest, Hungary    [&lt;ulink linkID="536337" linkType="Reference"&gt;536337&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="550177" linkType="Reference"&gt;550177&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2006, 24-week CLEAR study data were published, confirming the efficacy and safety of efalizumab seen at 12 weeks. At 24 weeks, 47.5% of patients with an initial PASI improvement of greater than or equal to 50% but less than 75% at week 12 achieved PASI 75; the median time to relapse was 58 days for patients who achieved a PASI 75 response after the initial 12 weeks of treatment. In addition, efalizumab was found to be effective in patients refractory to at least two systemic therapies [&lt;ulink linkID="737147" linkType="Reference"&gt;737147&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2004, 30-month data from the CLEAR trial were reported at the 34th Annual Meeting of the European Society for Dermatological  Research. Results showed that 68% of patients achieved a &amp;gt;= PASI 75 response after 30 months of drug treatment. Serious adverse effects were noted in 3.1% of patients after 30 months. Efalizumab demonstrated an increasing efficacy over time and had a relatively slow onset of action. In approximately 10% of patients, inflammatory papules developed after  4 to  6 weeks of treatment, but these usually disappeared upon continuation of treatment. Rebound was noted in only 6% of patients [&lt;ulink linkID="561974" linkType="Reference"&gt;561974&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2003, results of a phase III randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study, involving 597 patients aged 18 to 75 were published. Patients were randomized to receive sc efalizumab (1 or 2 mg/kg/week) or placebo for 12 weeks. Based upon response after 12 weeks, patients either received an additional 12 weeks of efalizumab or placebo. Treatment was discontinued at 24 weeks and patients were followed for an additional 12 weeks. At 12 weeks, more than half of efalizumab-treated patients experienced a clinically meaningful benefit, with some patients achieving clinical benefit as early as 4 weeks. After 12 weeks of efalizumab therapy, 22% of patients receiving 1 mg/kg of efalizumab and 28% of patients receiving 2 mg/kg of efalizumab reached the primary efficacy endpoint of 75% or greater improvement in PASI scores compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. Over this same interval, 52% and 57% of patients receiving 1 or 2 mg/kg efalizumab, respectively, achieved 50% or greater improvement in PASI compared to 16% of placebo-treated patients. Of the efalizumab-treated patients with 75% or greater PASI scores at 12 weeks, 77% who were continued on efalizumab maintained improvement through 24 weeks compared to 20% of those switched to placebo. Approximately 90% of these patients maintained a 50% PASI improvement score at 24 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="514134" linkType="reference"&gt;514134&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="514014" linkType="reference"&gt;514014&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2004, Genentech reported preliminary long-term data from this trial which showed that efalizumab was effective and safe over 30 months of treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="551677" linkType="Reference"&gt;551677&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, data from an open-label, randomized, double-blind, phase III 12-week extension trial were presented. The 368 patients who received at least one dose of efalizumab during the initial 12 weeks were eligible to receive once-weekly 1 mg/kg doses of efalizumab for an additional 12 weeks. At week 12, 27% of the patients receiving efalizumab had achieved a PASI 75, suggesting an improvement in the reduction of symptoms with continued treatment. At the end of the study (week 24), 44% of patients who had received at least one dose of efalizumab achieved a PASI 75 response. In addition, 67% of patients achieved a 50% or greater PASI improvement at the end of the study, versus 59% of patients at week 12 and 15% of patients saw a 90% or greater PASI improvement. Preliminary results from an open-label, multicenter trial evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of continuous efalizumab treatment were also disclosed. Patients received 2 mg/kg efalizumab weekly for an initial 12 weeks followed by a once-weekly dose of 1 mg/kg efalizumab. Among the 194 patients who remained in the trial until week 84, 67% achieved a PASI 75 response and 86% achieved a PASI 50 response. Furthermore, 34% achieved a 90% or greater PASI improvement. No new adverse events emerged during efalizumab treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="499110" linkType="reference"&gt;499110&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="552308" linkType="Reference"&gt;552308&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2003, Serono reported further data in an investor meeting showing that continuous treatment with efalizumab up to 60 weeks maintained or improved response rates; 45% of patients achieved a PASI 75 response [&lt;ulink linkID="512147" linkType="reference"&gt;512147&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, data were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in Chicago, IL, in which the results from a 1 mg/kg/week 12 week phase III trial were pooled with those from three previously completed, randomized, controlled phase III trials providing a cohort of 2355 patients. Data from this cohort demonstrated that the safety profile of the drug was consistent across all four trials and supported the safety and tolerability of efalizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. No evidence of end organ toxicity or increased risk of infection was reported [&lt;ulink linkID="501665" linkType="reference"&gt;501665&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2003, results from a phase III psoriasis study of efalizumab were presented at the 61st Annual American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) meeting in San Francisco, CA. In a double blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, 556 adult patients were randomized in a 2 to 1 ratio to receive weekly sc doses of 1 mg/kg efalizumab (n = 369), or placebo (n = 187) for 12 weeks. Efalizumab improved psoriasis area and severity index scores by 75% (PASI 75) or greater in 27% of patients, versus 4% of patients on placebo, and 59% achieved 50% or greater PASI score improvement (PASI 50), versus 14% in the placebo group. Mild adverse events (headache, chills, pain, fever and myalgia) were mainly associated with the first two injections of efalizumab, whereas for later doses, the incidence of acute adverse events was similar between the efalizumab and placebo groups [&lt;ulink linkID="483064" linkType="reference"&gt;483064&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2002, Genentech and XOMA revealed that a randomized phase III study of efalizumab achieved its primary efficacy endpoint. The primary endpoint of the study was to compare the percentage of patients who achieved PASI 75 after 12 weeks of efalizumab therapy with patients receiving placebo. Genentech and XOMA planned to include this data as part of a BLA[&lt;ulink linkID="464161" linkType="reference"&gt;464161&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2002, preliminary data from an open-label, long-term treatment study with efalizumab was reported. The study initially involved 339 patients who received a 3-month course of therapy consisting of weekly sc doses of 2 mg/kg efalizumab. After the initial 3 months of treatment, 288 patients achieved PASI 50 scores or an Overall Lesion Severity score (OLS) of "mild". These patients were entered into an extended treatment phase in which they received weekly doses of 1 mg/kg efalizumab, with a provision for return to 2 mg/kg. All 288 subjects entering the extended treatment phase were assessed for maintenance of PASI improvements at 6 months. Preliminary analysis showed that at 6 months, 77.1% of patients had achieved PASI 50 and 51% of these patients had achieved PASI 75. Of the 265 patients completing 9 months treatment, 80.5% achieved PASI 50 and 58% had PASI 75. Of the 215 patients completing one year, 79.1% achieved PASI 50 and 61% had PASI 75 [&lt;ulink linkID="459967" linkType="reference"&gt;459967&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were presented in March 2003 at the 61st annual AAD meeting in San Francisco, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="483065" linkType="reference"&gt;483065&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were published in May 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="902994" linkType="Reference"&gt;902994&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2001, initial results from the second pivotal phase III trial of efalizumab were presented at the AAD meeting in Anaheim, CA; the treatment met all primary and secondary endpoints. Among study findings, 22% of patients given 1 mg/kg of efalizumab and 28% of patients given 2 mg/kg of efalizumab achieved PASI score improvement of 75% or greater after 12 weeks (versus 5% placebo). Of the 134 partial responders, 58% of patients receiving 2 mg/kg of efalizumab weekly and 29% of patients receiving 2 mg/kg of efalizumab every other week achieved a 75% or greater improvement in PASI score after an additional 12 weeks of treatment (versus 4% placebo). Further, 12% of initial non-responders given 4 mg/kg of efalizumab achieved 75% or greater PASI score improvement after an additional 12 weeks of treatment (versus 2% placebo). Efalizumab was generally well tolerated in the study after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment; however, mild-to-moderate headache, pain, chills, nausea and fever occurred more frequently in patients treated with efalizumab than placebo; these adverse events diminished after the first dose [&lt;ulink linkID="417296" linkType="reference"&gt;417296&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="417812" linkType="reference"&gt;417812&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2001, preliminary results from the initial 12-week treatment period of the two pivotal phase III trials of efalizumab were disclosed. After 12 weeks of treatment, both trials met the primary efficacy endpoint, which was the difference in the percentage of efalizumab-treated patients achieving a 75% or greater improvement in PASI scores over placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="410649" linkType="reference"&gt;410649&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2001, these results were also presented at the second Joint Meeting of the International Psoriasis Symposium and European Congress on Psoriasis in San Francisco, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="413287" linkType="reference"&gt;413287&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2000, patient enrollment was completed in two pivotal phase III trials evaluating efalizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. These trials involved more than 1000 patients at approximately 80 sites in the US and Canada, and were designed to measure the safety and efficacy of efalizumab administered weekly in 12 sc doses to patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkID="385394" linkType="reference"&gt;385394&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At the 59th AAD, researchers presented preliminary results from a 12-week open-label study running in parallel to the phase III program that retreated patients who received iv or sc efalizumab in previous phase I or II clinical studies. Patients in the retreatment study received an initial sc conditioning dose of 0.7 mg/kg of efalizumab followed by 11 weekly sc doses of 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg. Some patients received topical steroids, calcipotriene or UVB phototherapy concurrently with efalizumab treatment. The primary measure of response was change in PASI scores between day zero and day 84. In a preliminary analysis of 50 patients, the study found a second course of therapy exhibited similar efficacy rates to the first course of therapy as measured by PASI. In all, almost 80% of patients achieved a comparable or better PASI score at the end of the second course of treatment compared to the first course of treatment. At the end of treatment, 28% of patients achieved 75% or better PASI improvement, and 58% achieved 50% or better improvement. Efalizumab was well tolerated by most patients in the study [&lt;ulink linkID="400929" linkType="reference"&gt;400929&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In January 1999, a phase II trial in moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients was completed [&lt;ulink linkID="310928" linkType="reference"&gt;310928&lt;/ulink&gt;] and initial data were presented at the Canadian Dermatology Association meeting in Vancouver, Canada [&lt;ulink linkID="321404" linkType="reference"&gt;321404&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In the phase I/II open-label study, a group of 61 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis were given an initial sc conditioning dose of 0.7 mg/kg of efalizumab, followed by 12 weekly sc treatments of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg. The primary response measure was change in PASI scores between day zero and day 84. Overall, 75% of patients given efalizumab achieved 50% or better PASI improvement at day 84, and 31% achieved 75% or better improvement [&lt;ulink linkID="400929" linkType="reference"&gt;400929&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2001,  trial data were presented on efalizumab at the International Psoriasis Symposium and European Congress on Psoriasis second Joint Meeting in San Francisco, CA. In a phase Id trial, efalizumab was safe and well tolerated at less than or equal to 0.3 mg/kg. Weekly sc injections led to a greater than or equal to 75% reduction of the PASI in 25 to 38% of patients; 67 to 90% showed a greater than or equal to 50% reduction of the PASI [&lt;ulink linkID="413287" linkType="reference"&gt;413287&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Transplant rejection&lt;/subtitle&gt;In August 2008, a randomized, open label, active control, parallel assignment phase II/III trial (NCT00729768; ACD4230g) was planned in subjects (expected n = 200) undergoing renal transplantation. The subjects were to receive either &lt;ulink linkID="11141" linkType="Drug"&gt;basiliximab&lt;/ulink&gt; plus efalizumab or basiliximab alone, plus mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids.

A total 38 patients received efalizumab (0.5 to 2 mg/kg sc) once a week for 2 weeks, with maintenance immunosuppression comprising either &lt;ulink linkID="4200" linkType="Drug"&gt;sirolimus&lt;/ulink&gt;, half-dose cyclosporin and prednisone, or &lt;ulink linkID="3669" linkType="Drug"&gt;mycophenolate mofetil&lt;/ulink&gt;, full-dose cyclosporin and prednisone. At 6 months, 4 of 38 patients had a biopsy-proven episode of acute rejection, 3 of whom had a rejection episode during the first 3 months while on efalizumab therapy. At 48 h after the first administration, there was complete saturation of the receptor and about 80% down-regulation of CD11a. Two patients developed polyclonal B-cell post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, both were on high-dose efalizumab and had received full-dose cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone.

The patients were to remain on standard therapy and receive weekly sc injections of efalizumab or placebo. The primary endpoint, a reduction in the signs and symptoms of the disease in patients with active PsA, was to be measured after 12 weeks of treatment using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 composite score. In addition, patients were be evaluated for improvement in the PASI score [&lt;ulink linkID="477626" linkType="reference"&gt;477626&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="488415" linkType="reference"&gt;488415&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In March 2004, XOMA reported that the primary endpoint of the trial had not been met and concluded that the antibody was not useful for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. Preliminary results showed that 28% of patients receiving efalizumab achieved an ACR20 response, compared to 19% of patients receiving placebo.

The central role of T-lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is well established and immunomodulatory therapies targeted at T-lymphocytes, such as cyclosporine, are effective in the treatment of psoriasis. Recently, several biological agents directed against different points in the immune cascade have reached clinical evaluation. One of these biologically active monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that interferes with the activation of T-lymphocytes is &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (hu1124, Xanelim).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The migration and activation of T-lymphocytes into and within the skin is orchestrated by a cascade of signals. One of these signals is the expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 on the cell surface of T-lymphocytes. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;Efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD11a, which constitutes a part of the LFA-1 antigen. By binding to the CD11a molecule, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; is a potential inhibitor of LFA-1 and, therefore, of T-lymphocyte activation and the progression of the psoriatic skin inflammation.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;Efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, previously referred to as anti-CD11a, is a humanized mAb directed against the CD11a cell surface antigen [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="365676"&gt;365676&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It is humanized from a murine antihuman CD11a mAb and is a full length IgG1 molecule [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="250376"&gt;250376&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Detailed data on the synthesis and structure-activity reports are not available at present. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;The cell-surface antigen, CD11a, constitutes the alpha-chain LFA-1, which is a member of the leukocyte integrin family (LFA-1/MAC-1/p150,95). These are cell-surface molecules involved in cell adhesion to other cells or proteins. The leukocyte integrins have a common beta-chain (CD18) and a unique alpha-chain. LFA-1 is expressed on the surface of Th-lymphocytes and binds to intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM)-1, -2 and -3. Expression of ICAM-1 is induced by a variety of cytokines, eg, interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and interferon (IFN)gamma and is widely expressed in endothelial cells, monocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts and activated lymphocytes. The potential mechanism of action of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; is the inhibition of LFA-1 receptor signaling, thus causing disruption of T-cell function (adhesion, migration, activation), which would alter the clinical manifestation of T-cell-mediated disease [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="250376"&gt;250376&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In vitro studies demonstrated that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (i) binds to human and chimpanzee leukocytes; (ii) inhibits lymphocyte binding to ICAM-1-expressing keratinocytes; and, (iii) inhibits T-cell proliferation induced by soluble ICAM-1 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="250376"&gt;250376&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It also inhibits the mixed lymphocyte reaction. In vivo studies in murine and chimpanzee models showed that the antibody (i) downregulates expression of LFA-1 on lymphocytes; (ii) prevents contact dermatitis to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB); (iii) delays onset and decreases severity of collagen-induced arthritis; (iv) prolongs survival of skin transplants; and, (v) increases survival of heart transplants. Since psoriasis appears to have a significant T-cell-mediated component, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; may have a potential therapeutic effect in the treatment of psoriasis.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Treatment with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; decreased CD11a expression on circulating T-cells by +/- 75% and available anti-CD11a binding sites were reduced by &amp;gt; 97%. Total circulating lymphocyte numbers were +/- 2-fold greater. Both CD11a expression and lymphocyte counts returned to pretreatment levels after drug clearance [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="412334"&gt;412334&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;After a single iv injection of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, the plasma clearance decreases with increased dose, and seems to be saturable at plasma concentrations &amp;gt; 10 microg/ml. When investigated in human subjects with psoriasis, the clearance decreased from 322 ml/day/kg at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg to 6.6 ml/day/kg at 10 mg/kg of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="373110"&gt;373110&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This probably reflects an observed reduction of CD11a expression on the T-lymphocytes available for dose-dependent removal of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; from the circulation. At doses &amp;gt; 0.3 mg/kg, CD11a staining was completely blocked but at lower doses, only partial block occurred [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="365676"&gt;365676&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, regardless of the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; dose administered, cell-surface CD11a remained at the reduced level for as long as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was detectable (&amp;gt; 0.025 microg/ml). At plasma concentrations &amp;lt; 3 microg/ml, the drug was rapidly cleared from circulation but CD11a returned to normal within 7 to 10 days.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;No data are currently available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In a phase Ia, open-label, single-dose, dose-escalating safety study of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was well tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity after a single injection. The study was completed in April 1998 and has been published [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="365676"&gt;365676&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A total of 31 patients received a single injection of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (0.03 to 10 mg/kg). Compared to baseline, statistically significant decreases in disease activity, as measured by the psoriasis and severity index (PASI), were observed in patients who received &amp;gt; 1.0 mg/kg at weeks 2 to 10 and in patients treated with a dose of 0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg at weeks 3 and 4. No significant decrease in PASI score was noted at doses &amp;lt; 0.1 mg/kg. The clinical response with doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg was accompanied by a complete block of CD11a staining, decreased numbers of epidermal and dermal CD3+ T-lymphocytes, decreased keratinocyte and blood vessel expression of ICAM-1 and epidermal thinning. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase Ib, multidose, dose-escalating study with enrollment of +/- 40 patients has been announced [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="300667"&gt;300667&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Enrolment should have been completed in April 1998, but results from this study are not available at present. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Results from a phase I/II dose-finding study were presented at the 59th American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Congress in Washington in March 2001. In this study, a group of 61 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis were given an initial sc dose of 0.7 mg/kg of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, followed by 11 weekly injections of 1, 2 or 4 mg/kg. Overall, 75% of patients given efazilumab achieved &gt;/= 50% improvement in the PASI score, and 31% achieved &gt;/= 75% improvement in PASI at day 84. Interestingly, the lowest maintenance dose (1 mg/kg) gave the best result, with successively decreasing response with higher doses [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="400929"&gt;400929&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In an additional evaluation, iv administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; showed similar efficacy to sc administration [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="400929"&gt;400929&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These results have been published in abstract form [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="415627"&gt;415627&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Preliminary results from another study running parallel to phase III studies were also presented at the 59th AAD Congress. In this study, patients previously involved in phase I/II studies were retreated sc with an initial dose of 0.7 mg/kg followed by 11 weekly doses of 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg. Results indicate that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in these patients exhibits similar efficacy rates to the first course of therapy, as measured by PASI [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="400929"&gt;400929&lt;/ulink&gt;]&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;A phase II, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study tested &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in 145 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients, who underwent a course of eight weekly doses of either the study drug or placebo. The study, conducted in Canada, was completed in October 1998 and results were first presented in July 1999 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="330918"&gt;330918&lt;/ulink&gt;] but have not yet been published. In this study, patients were evaluated 56 days after beginning treatment, ie, 7 days following the last dose. Additional follow-up evaluations were made at 91 and 140 days. The primary endpoint was clinical improvement, using the physician's global assessment (PGA) score. Analysis of data from the study showed that 48% of patients treated with the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (0.3 mg/kg) showed &gt;/= 50% improvement in the PGA at day 56, compared with 15% of placebo-treated patients (p = 0.0002, Fisher's Exact test). An excellent outcome, ie, &gt;/= 75% improvement in the PGA score was achieved in 25% of patients treated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, compared with 2% of the placebo group. Additional data related to extended exposure to &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; has also been collected but is not yet available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;Following the positive results from the phase II study, two phase III studies were initiated in December 1999 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="351205"&gt;351205&lt;/ulink&gt;] and enrolment was completed in October 2000. Patients (n  &amp;gt; 1000) at +/- 80 sites in the US and Canada were included. Positive results indicating achievement of primary efficacy endpoint (&gt;/= 75% improvement in PASI) from these studies were announced in May 2001 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="410649"&gt;410649&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Initial results from the first (ACD2058g) of these pivotal phase III studies were presented at the Second Joint Meeting of the International Psoriasis Symposium and European Congress on Psoriasis in San Francisco [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="413287"&gt;413287&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the 498-patient study, patients were treated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (1 and 2 mg/kg/week) or placebo for 12 weeks. A total of 39% of patients receiving &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (1 mg/kg) and 27% given 2 mg/kg of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; achieved PASI score improvement of &gt;/= 75% after 12 weeks (versus 2% placebo). Furthermore, 20% more patients achieved the primary efficacy endpoint when they received an additional 12 weeks of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment. In addition, 61% of patients given &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (1 mg/kg) and 51% of patients given 2 mg/kg achieved PASI score improvement of &gt;/= 50% after 12 weeks of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment (versus 15% placebo).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Initial results from the second phase III study (ACD2059g) were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology 'ACADEMY 2001' meeting in Anaheim, CA [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="417296"&gt;417296&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the study, 597 patients were randomized to receive &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (1 and 2 mg/kg; n = 243) or placebo (n = 122) by weekly sc injection for 12 weeks. A total of 22 and 28% of patients achieved PASI score improvement of &gt;/= 75% when given &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (1 and 2 mg/kg, respectively). This was achieved in only 5% of the placebo group. When treated biweekly for another 12 weeks, 58 and 29% of partial responders achieved the 75% improvement in PASI.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;In the open-label phase Ia study in psoriasis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="365676"&gt;365676&lt;/ulink&gt;], certain adverse effects were observed as doses increased. Adverse events were mild at doses of &amp;lt;/= 0.3 mg/kg and included mild chills, abdominal discomfort, headache and fever. At a single dose of &gt;/= 0.6 mg/kg, headache was the most common adverse event but nausea and fever were also observed. Most adverse events occurred within 24 h, but the exact length of clinical follow-up is not stated. No impairment of T-cell function was observed, as measured by the ability of bacteriophage phiX174 to mount a T-cell-dependent antibody response, although an impaired isotype switch was noted. The significance of this observation will be further evaluated in long-term studies.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the phase II study, the most common adverse events were mild headaches and low-grade fever, particularly after the first dose [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="330918"&gt;330918&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The most commonly observed adverse events in the retreatment study were headache, rhinitis and other aches and pains [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="400929"&gt;400929&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;Efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was generally well tolerated in the two phase III studies [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="413287"&gt;413287&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="417296"&gt;417296&lt;/ulink&gt;]. After 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with weekly injections of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; (1 or 2 mg/kg sc), mild-to-moderate headache, pain, chills, nausea and fever occurred more frequently than in the placebo group. The adverse events diminished after the first dose. Serious adverse events observed were tightness of the throat and, in one patient, reduced platelet count. No increased rate of infection was observed and T-cell depletion did not occur.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;The central role of T-lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is obvious and the experiments with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; further underline this. The studies under evaluation show that it is possible to interfere with the pathogenesis of psoriasis by blocking the surface antigen, LFA-1, which is needed for T-lymphocyte activation. However, the signaling cascade for T-cell activation is complicated and contains several other potential targets for treatment. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;Efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, a monoclonal antibody against CD11a, which constitutes a part of the LFA-1 antigen, is one of the first T-cell-targeted therapies.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Data presented to date suggest that a single dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; has a short-term effect on psoriasis disease activity. The minimal dose for this effect appears to be 0.3 mg/kg and doses &amp;gt; 1 mg/kg seem to be less effective. Thus, the therapeutic window for a single dose lies between 0.3 to 2 mg/kg/day. Dosing with 1-week intervals seems to be sufficient for maintaining disease improvement. This makes treatment on outpatient basis possible, which would increase compliance. The need for injections still can be an obstacle for some patients. Improvement continues beyond 12 weeks of treatment but, at the moment we do not precisely know how long patients are to be treated for maximal response and how safe such a treatment would be. The time to relapse after cessation of treatment also needs to be investigated. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;As with all other therapies that interfere with T-cell function, one of the central questions will be to what extent &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; produces immunomodulation and/or -suppression. This will also be reflected in the occurrence of infections in long-term treatment. In short-term treatment, patients treated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="11578"&gt;efalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; have not had more infections than patients treated with placebo. Also, the possibility of cumulative tolerance cannot be assessed until long-term studies have been conducted.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company
