In February 2019, a phase III trial in aGvHD was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="2127551" linkType="Reference"&gt;2127551&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By October 2018, a phase IIa trial in GvHD patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was underway [&lt;ulink linkID="2088821" linkType="Reference"&gt;2088821&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2019, the US FDA accepted for review a BLA for an sc formulation of vedolizumab for maintenance therapy in adults with moderately to severely active UC [&lt;ulink linkID="2150024" linkType="Reference"&gt;2150024&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2015, a phase III trial was initiated of vedolizumab sc as maintenance therapy in CD [&lt;ulink linkID="1739464" linkType="Reference"&gt;1739464&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in February 2019,  phase III development for the sc formulation in  the US, Europe and Japan remained ongoing in UC and CD [&lt;ulink linkID="2033620" linkType="Reference"&gt;&lt;/ulink&gt;&lt;ulink linkID="2118859" linkType="Reference"&gt;2118859&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Takeda was previously developing the drug for other indications. In March 2016, a phase III trial of iv vedolizumab was planned in patients with non-end-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and underlying underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, in March 2017, the study was withdrawn prior to enrollment of patients and development for this indication was presumed to have been discontinued [&lt;ulink linkID="1908530" linkType="Reference"&gt;1908530&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In June 2013, Takeda filed a BLA for moderately-to-severely active CD and UC [&lt;ulink linkID="1443087" linkType="Reference"&gt;1443087&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2013, the BLA was granted Priority Review status for the treatment of UC; the BLA for CD was to be reviewed by under the standard review timeline [&lt;ulink linkID="1473843" linkType="Reference"&gt;1473843&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2013, the FDA questioned whether the benefits of the drug outweigh its risk because of concerns that vedolizumab may pose a risk of PML as the drug's mechanism was similar to &lt;ulink linkID="6692" linkType="Drug"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, which was associated with a PML risk [&lt;ulink linkID="1506753" linkType="Reference"&gt;1506753&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later that month, Takeda submitted a major amendment to its BLA for UC, including an updated proposed labeling [&lt;ulink linkID="1511721" linkType="Reference"&gt;1511721&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later in December 2013, the FDA's Gastrointestinal Drugs and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committees recommended approval of the drug for adults with moderately to severely active UC and CD [&lt;ulink linkID="1507545" linkType="Reference"&gt;1507545&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later that month, the FDA extended the PDUFA Priority Review date for UC to May 20, 2014; at that time, the PDUFA date for CD was June 18, 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1511721" linkType="Reference"&gt;1511721&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In approximately 208,050 patient-years of exposure, 32,752 patients reported 80,218 AEs; in which 4% were in patients with CB (with CB; n = 1112) and 62% were in patients without CB (n = 20,201; remaining events were in patient without concomitant medication). In patients with CB, incidence of infections, serious infections, malignancies, infusion-site reactions, fatal events and post-operative complications was 8, 2, &amp;lt; 1, 1, &amp;gt; 1 and &amp;lt; 1% in CD group (n = 1285); 8, 2, &amp;lt; 1, &amp;lt; 1, &amp;lt; 1 and &amp;lt; 1% in UC group and 20, 9, 1, 0, 1 and 1% in OI (n = 199) patients, respectively, while for patients without CB, the values were 9, 2, &amp;lt; 1, 1, &amp;lt; 1 and 1% for CD (n = 25,929); 8, 1, &amp;lt; 1, 1, &amp;lt; 1 and &amp;lt; 1% for UC (n = 26,272); and 17, 5, 1, &amp;lt; 1, 1 and 1% for OI (n = 3654) patients, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2127814" linkType="Reference"&gt;2127814&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2019, further data were presented at the 2019 DDW in San Diego, CA. Most commonly reported serious infections in patients treated with concomitant biologics were intestinal abscess, anal abscess and pneumonia.

The aim of this analysis was to characterise vedolizumab pharmacokinetics in patients with UC and CD, to identify clinically relevant determinants of vedolizumab clearance, and to describe the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship using population modelling. Linear elimination half-life of vedolizumab was 25.5 days; linear clearance (CLL ) was 0.159 l/day for UC and 0.155 l/day for CD; central compartment volume of distribution (Vc ) was 3.19 l; and peripheral compartment volume of distribution was 1.66 l using reference covariate values. For CLL and Vc, interindividual variabilities (%CV) were 35 and 19%, respectively and residual variance was 24%.

In May 2013, similar data were presented at Digestive Disease Week 2013 in Orlando, FL. Subgroup analysis results were also discussed. Patients were stratified into three groups by previous failure to prior treatment with an anti-TNF, an immunomodulator but not anti-TNF or corticosteroids only. A higher proportion of patients achieved clinical remission with vedolizumab in the immunomodulator and corticosteroids only failure subgroups than the anti-TNF failure subgroup, however the treatment differences between placebo and vedolizumab were found to be similar across the subgroups [&lt;ulink linkID="1418729" linkType="Reference"&gt;1418729&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data from 461 patients (with response at week-6) in maintenance arm were presented were presented at the same meeting. Vedolizumab significantly reduced the mean Crohn's disease activity index scores and showed higher clinical remission rates than placebo (primary endpoint) over 52 weeks.

In the quartile analysis of the raw data, exposure-response relationships for all exposure metrics and each outcome (partial mayo score [PMS], clinical response  and clinical remission ) were evident, although for week 6 PMS and clinical response endpoints, exposure-response relationships were more robust than for clinical remission endpoint. A clear exposure-response relationship was still evident for the PMS and clinical response endpoints after case-matching adjustment [&lt;ulink linkID="1895283" linkType="Reference"&gt;1895283&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2017, data from a post-hoc analysis of the study were presented at the 12th Congress of European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation in Barcelona, Spain, which showed that vedolizumab was significantly more effective compared with placebo at achieving sustained remission, and rectal bleeding subscore equaling 0 at weeks 26, 38 and 52, in patients with moderate to severely active UC who achieved remission at week 14.3. Additionally, maintenance treatment with vedolizumab resulted in 60% of patients sustaining clinical remission from week 14 to 52 compared with 37% who underwent placebo washout [&lt;ulink linkID="1901563" linkType="Reference"&gt;1901563&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. Based on PMS, 33 and 20% of patients receiving vedolizumab and placebo, respectively, were in clinical remission at week 14; and based on rectal bleeding subscore 47 and 29% of patients, respectively, were in remission [&lt;ulink linkID="1903332" linkType="Reference"&gt;1903332&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2017, futher post hoc analysis data from patients who achieved clinical remission at week 14 were presented at the DDW 2017 in Chicago, IL. When compared to placebo group, sustained clinical remission upto week 52 was achieved by a significantly higher proportion of patients in vedolizumab treatment group who had achieved remission at week 14; and between vedolizumab/placebo and placebo treatment groups, no significant differences were observed.  Over time, proportion patients who achieved clinical remission in vendolizumab week 6 non-responder subgroup demonstrated a steady increase; and by week 52, 27% of patients had achieved clinical remission. Compared to placebo and vendolizumab/placebo groups, patients in vendolizumab treatment group exhibited a substantially higher probability of achieving clinical remission according to Kaplan-Meier analysis; and based on partial Mayo score definition, similar results were observed for time to sustained remission [&lt;ulink linkID="1924128" linkType="Reference"&gt;1924128&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2017, furtehr post-hoc subgroup analysis presented at the 25th UEGW in Barcelona, Spain, showed significant improvements in stool frequency and rectal bleeding scores in all paitents, and in TNF antagoinist naive subjects [&lt;ulink linkID="1976717" linkType="Reference"&gt;1976717&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1976686" linkType="Reference"&gt;1976686&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later that month, futher clinical data were presented at the ACG Annual Scientific Meeting in Orlando, FL. At week 2, 4 and 6, in vedolizumab versus placebo groups, patients achieving a SFS &amp;lt;/= 1 were 44.6, 46.2 and 53.1 versus 22.4, 22.4 and 21.1% (anti-TNF naive) and 36.0, 38.7 and 45.3 versus 28.9, 30.2 and 30.9% (overall population), respectively; patients who achieved RBS of 0 were 30.8, 37.7 and 49.2 versus 18.4, 27.6, 26.3(anti-TNF naive) and 29.8, 36.9 and 45.3 versus 21.5, 28.2 and 28.9% (overall population), respectively; patients achieving both RBS of 0 and SFS of &amp;lt;/= 1 were 22.3, 31.5 and 40.8 versus 6.6, 13.2, 13.2% (anti-TNF naive) and 19.1, 28.0 and 33.8 versus 10.1, 14.8 and 16.8%, respectively   [&lt;ulink linkID="1985421" linkType="Reference"&gt;1985421&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2017, a further post-hoc analysis of evaluating deep remission with vedolizumab in patients was presented at the 2017 Advances in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (AIBD) annual conference,  in Orlando, FL [&lt;ulink linkID="1980242" linkType="Reference"&gt;1980242&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2018, further post-hoc data were presented at the 13th ECCO Congress on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in Vienna, Austria. In the overall population, sustained corticosteroid-free clinical remission was achieved by a greater proportion of patients in vedolizumab and vedolizumab/placebo versus placebo groups (10.2, 7.5 versus 1.4%, respectively); 16.2, 10 versus 0% of TNF-antagonist-naive patients, respectively; 5.4, 0 versus 3.4% of TNF-antagonist failure patients. Treatment (placebo versus vedolizumab: odd ratio [OR] 0.1), TNF antagonist exposure (no versus yes: OR 3.9) and disease duration (&amp;gt;2 years versus &amp;lt;/= 2 years: OR 0.4) were the covariates associated with the odds of achieving sustained corticosteroid-free remission [&lt;ulink linkID="2012931" linkType="Reference"&gt;2012931&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further IBDQ data were presented at the same conference. Early improvement was observed in all IBDQ subdomains (work/school, fatigue, unwell, frustration, sleep, anxiety, depression, satisfaction, sexual activity and energy) at week 6 and was sustained up to week 52 [&lt;ulink linkID="2012970" linkType="Reference"&gt;2012970&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2018, further data were presented at the 2018 DDW in Washington DC. Compared with placebo, vedolizumab showed favorable number needed to harm (NNH) value -2436 and -257 in combined safety population and intent-to-treat groups, respectively, indicating vedolizumab might not be associated with increased risk of HZ infection. Vedolizumab at q4w and q8w had NNH value of -126 and 3843, respectively, relative to placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="2039010" linkType="Reference"&gt;2039010&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. In anti-TNFalpha naive and failure patients, the proportion of patients achieving CS-free remission atleast 32 weeks until week-52 with placebo were 0 and 3.4%, respectively; vedolizumab/placebo were 10 and 0%, respectively; and vedolizumab were 15.2 and 5.4%, respectively. In placebo, vedolizumab and vedolizumab/placebo groups, according to Kaplan-Meier analysis the probability of sustained CS-free clinical remission (primary endpoint) were 1.8, 13.0 and 8.5, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="2038933" linkType="Reference"&gt;2038933&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2007, a phase II, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study (&lt;ulink linkID="68920" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01177228&lt;/ulink&gt;; C13002) was initiated , to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of vedolizumab derived from a commercially scalable  cell line in patients (n = 44) with UC.

In all patients (n = 1434) receiving vedolizumab in GEMINI 1 and 2 studies, seven opportunistic infections were documented, which included Clostridium difficile colitis, CMV colitis and CMV infection (n = 5, 1 and 1, respectively). Serious event was reported in one patient; however, one non-serious event resulted in study discontinuation [&lt;ulink linkID="1903296" linkType="Reference"&gt;1903296&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2015, pooled data on pregnancy outcomes in clinical trials of the drug were presented at the 10th Annual ECCO Congress on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in Barcelona, Spain. A total of 27 pregnancies were recorded in females participating in the trials and 20 in the partners of male patients in the trials. Female participants were discontinued if they became pregnant during the study. Of the 24 vedolizumab -treated females, 11 resulted in live births (two premature). Congenital agenesis of the corpus callosum was reported in the healthy volunteer who had received a single dose of the drug and had an obstetric history of two spontaneous abortions and one ectopic pregnancy.

In October 2015, data were presented at the 23rd UEG Week in Barcelona, Spain.   In patients undergoing maintenance therapy as part of the GEMINI I study, discontinuation of immunosuppressant use  did not affect the efficacy of vedolizumab.  In GEMINI II study, a modest trend favoring continued  immunosuppressant use during the maintenance therapy period was observed [&lt;ulink linkID="1706922" linkType="Reference"&gt;1706922&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1706912" linkType="Reference"&gt;1706912&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2014, data were presented from GEMINI 1 (NCT00783718) and GEMINI 2 (NCT00783692) studies in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease at the 9th ECCO Congress on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in Copenhagen, Denmark.  By week 6, complete receptor saturation was observed, which was maintained until week 52 in q4w and q8w vedolizumab dose groups. Overall, 4% of patients tested positive for anti-vedolizumab antibody at any time during continuous vedolizumab therapy [&lt;ulink linkID="1542726" linkType="Reference"&gt;1542726&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In September 2016,  152-week interim data from an analysis of the CD  and UC efficacy population in the GEMINI LTS study, which included 1297 and 845 patients, respectively were published. After 152 weeks of exposure, 96% of UC patients who responded to vedolizumab induction were in remission. The respective response and remission rates in patients who discontinued every-8-week vedolizumab maintenance therapy in the GEMINI 1 trial before week 52 were 41 and 28%, and 19 and 6% when their dosing was increased to every 4 weeks in GEMINI LTS after 52 weeks and before the dose increase, respectively. In CD patients with a response at week 6 in GEMINI 2 who received vedolizumab continuously, 89% were in remission at 152 weeks. In those who withdrew early from GEMINI 2, the increase in dosing frequency from every 8 weeks to every 4 in GEMINI LTS improved their outcome with 47% achieving a clinical response and 32% in remission at week 52 of GEMINI LTS [&lt;ulink linkID="1802891" linkType="Reference"&gt;1802891&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1802892" linkType="Reference"&gt;1802892&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1802712" linkType="Reference"&gt;1802712&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In February 2018, further clinical data were presented at 13th ECCO Congress on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in Vienna, Austria. At one and three years, the survival probabilities of continuing vedolizumab were 77 and 64%, respectively, in UC patients, while 67 and 55%, respectively, in CD patients. Overall, patients discontinued treatment due to loss of efficacy was 24% and due to an AE was 14% [&lt;ulink linkID="2012969" linkType="Reference"&gt;2012969&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2019, further incidence rate of malignancy data were presented at 14th ECCO Congress on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in Copenhagen, Denmark. Among 2243 patients in GEMINI LTSS study followed up for 7746 patient-years, 31 experienced a malignancy with most common being renal and bladder (n = 6) and lower gastrointestinal tract (n = 5; p = 0.0427).

Final data were presented at the same conference. In patients who continued to receive vedolizumab throughout the entire study, clinical response was maintained long-term, however, the efficacy analysis was limited because of the expected, protocol-defined patient loss to follow-up. A total of 31 UC and 41% CD patients reported serious AEs (SAEs). Treatment-related AEs, treatment-related SAEs, deaths, treatment-related death, and AE led to treatment withdraw were reported in 40, 4, 0.4, 0.1 and 15% of UC patients, respectively, and 46, 6, 0.4, 0.1 and 17% of CD patients, respectively.  In both UC and CD patients, no case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was reported.

Despite the success of anti-TNF therapies in the treatment of IBD, a considerable proportion of patients are refractory to treatment, highlighting an unmet medical need for new therapies. Molecules that direct the trafficking of inflammatory cells, such as the alpha4beta7 integrin, are attractive targets for new drug candidates. The alpha4beta7 integrin is involved in lymphocyte recruitment to the normal and inflamed gut mucosa, and the lymphoid tissue. The pan-alpha4 integrin neutralizing mAb, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;, is not gut-selective but has demonstrated efficacy in IBD. However, treatment was associated with the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which has limited its use, especially in Europe. Vedolizumab (MNL-0002), &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="21991"&gt;Millennium Pharmaceutical&lt;/ulink&gt;'s gut-specific, alpha4beta7 integrin-neutralizing mAb, does not affect peripheral blood cell counts and appears to lack systemic effects. Data from phase II clinical trials of vedolizumab demonstrated efficacy with an attractive safety profile, especially in ulcerative colitis. Large phase III, multicenter trials in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease will provide valuable data for the ongoing development of vedolizumab, which might evolve as a new anti-inflammatory treatment option for the management of therapy-refractory patients.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic disorders affecting large populations of individuals, especially in the Western world, and often require intensive anti-inflammatory therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="466189"&gt;466189&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A systematic review of research published internationally between 1950 and 2009 reported a globally increasing incidence in pediatric IBD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128800"&gt;1128800&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In 2004, it was further reported that &amp;lt;/= 1.4 million individuals in the US and 2.2 million individuals in Europe had IBD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="656864"&gt;656864&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although the pathogenesis of IBD is incompletely understood, our increasing knowledge of the genetic basis of human IBD has led to the identification of several inflammatory mediators in both CD and UC [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128732"&gt;1128732&lt;/ulink&gt;]. TNFalpha, which is a pleiotrophic cytokine with important biological roles, was one of the first proinflammatory cytokines to be identified and it mediates various aspects of CD and UC, including tissue inflammation, acute-phase reaction, anti-infective immunity and fever responses [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="425332"&gt;425332&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="466189"&gt;466189&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1130832"&gt;1130832&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Anti-TNFalpha agents have markedly influenced the clinical management of many chronic inflammatory disorders, including IBD, and clinical remission can be maintained with the long-term inhibition of TNFalpha [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128801"&gt;1128801&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1130832"&gt;1130832&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Corticosteroids are also clinically used to effectively reduce inflammation in the short-term management of IBD, while immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine and anti-TNFalpha agents, are the key therapeutics used in the long-term management of IBD. Chimeric and humanized antibodies against TNFalpha are highly effective in CD and UC, and several agents have been evaluated in large, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6850"&gt;Infliximab&lt;/ulink&gt;, a chimeric IgG1 mAb against TNFalpha, can effectively induce and maintain clinical remission in the treatment of both CD and UC [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="352862"&gt;352862&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="587826"&gt;587826&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="602075"&gt;602075&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="602094"&gt;602094&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="639409"&gt;639409&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Two other anti-TNFalpha agents, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="14163"&gt;adalimumab&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="21138"&gt;certolizumab pegol&lt;/ulink&gt;, both humanized anti-TNFalpha antibodies, have also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="772173"&gt;772173&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="818476"&gt;818476&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="818561"&gt;818561&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="842836"&gt;842836&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1041289"&gt;1041289&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, despite the availability of these potent anti-inflammatory drugs we observe a significant number of therapy-refractory patients. Thus, a significant unmet medical need exists for novel therapies to treat IBD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128801"&gt;1128801&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An attractive approach to control acute inflammation in CD and UC is to inhibit the migration of leukocytes into the inflamed tissue by blocking cell-adhesion molecules. Integrins are a family of heterodimeric adhesion molecules that interact with ligands on target cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="476332"&gt;476332&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The alpha4beta7 integrin is primarily expressed on leukocytes (mainly memory T-cells) entering the gut. In the gut, the alpha4beta7 integrin interacts with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), which is selectively expressed in the gastrointestinal tract [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="511477"&gt;511477&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128762"&gt;1128762&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128763"&gt;1128763&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The ability of B- and T-cells to bind to MAdCAM-1 and recirculate away from the site of inflammation to mucosal surfaces is influenced by the level of alpha4beta7-expression, and by the functional state of the alpha4beta7 molecule. Colonic lamina propria cells of patients with IBD express an increased density of CD3+ and alpha4beta7+ cells compared with the colonic lamina propria cells of patients with irritable bowel syndrome [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="386934"&gt;386934&lt;/ulink&gt;]. MAdCAM-1 is expressed on the healthy endothelium of the intestinal vasculature and is significantly upregulated in inflamed tissue and IBD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="386934"&gt;386934&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128764"&gt;1128764&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It has been proposed that the blockade of this interaction might be a successful organ-specific and anti-inflammatory strategy for IBD.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The pan-alpha4 integrin-neutralizing mAb &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; that blocks the alpha4beta7 and alpha4beta1 integrins is launched in the US for the treatment of CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="899405"&gt;899405&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although effective in inducing remission of CD, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; has numerous other systemic effects and administration has been associated with causing immunosuppression, which increases the incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic infection of the CNS by JC virus [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128871"&gt;1128871&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128872"&gt;1128872&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It has been postulated that PML may be associated with inhibition of the alpha4beta1 integrin [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1138835"&gt;1138835&lt;/ulink&gt;]; therefore, a new agent has been investigated that targets the alpha4beta7 integrin. Vedolizumab is a neutralizing antibody against the alpha4beta7 integrin in phase II/III clinical development by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15938"&gt;Millennium Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ulink&gt; (formerly &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="27414"&gt;LeukoSite&lt;/ulink&gt;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20300"&gt;Takeda Pharmaceutical&lt;/ulink&gt;, for the treatment of CD and UC [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="357078"&gt;357078&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="398311"&gt;398311&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1120150"&gt;1120150&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Administration of Act-1 in the colitic cotton-top tamarin model effected resolution of disease [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="386933"&gt;386933&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The biological activity of vedolizumab is restricted to lymphoid organs in the gut and to occasional leukocytes in other tissues because it exclusively binds to the alpha4beta7 integrin over other integrins containing the alpha4 chain (eg, alpha4beta1) or the beta7 chain (eg, alphaEbeta7) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1039913"&gt;1039913&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="21991"&gt;Millennium&lt;/ulink&gt; has launched a program of phase III trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="33334"&gt;NCT00783718&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="33335"&gt;NCT00783692&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="35865"&gt;NCT00790933&lt;/ulink&gt;; GEMINI I,II and III, respectively) to assess vedolizumab in CD and UC, and Takeda planned to apply for marketing approval in the US, Europe and Japan in 2011 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="982533"&gt;982533&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This paper summarizes the current literature on vedolizumab.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Vedolizumab is comprised of the humanized light and heavy chains of Act-1 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116684"&gt;1116684&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="IN2791330"&gt;WO-09806248&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3689526"&gt;WO-2008115504&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The light and heavy chains contain the complementarity determining regions 1, 2 and 3 of each chain with framework and constant regions derived from the human GM607'CL and 21/28'CL antibodies, respectively. Nucleic acid inserts encoding the light and heavy chains of vedolizumab were generated using recombinant DNA technology (for light and heavy chain sequences see SEQ ID NO:1 and 2 in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3689526"&gt;WO-2008115504&lt;/ulink&gt;, respectively). To yield correctly assembled and folded mAbs in cell culture supernatant, the inserts were cloned into a suitable vector for protein expression, such as pTOK59D, and the vectors were sequence verified. Vectors encoding vedolizumab were used to electroporate a suitable mammalian host cell line, such as the SI CHO DG44 cell line grown in adhesion culture. The supernatant of vedolizumab-expressing SI CHO DG44 cell monolayers was quantified for mAb titer using an immunocompetition fluid microvolume assay technology. Single cell-derived clones from three cell-line pools that were stably expressing vedolizumab were isolated by limited-dilution cloning. High-expressing cell lines were then adapted to serum-free suspension culture to generate production cell lines. The mAb titer of five cell lines was &gt;/= 30 microg/ml/cell/day by immunocompetition fluid microvolume assay. The highest expressing production cell line, defined as #27.11, had a mAb final titer of 3.26 and 1.87 mg/ml by immunocompetition fluid microvolume assay and protein A assay, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3689526"&gt;WO-2008115504&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vitro&lt;/subtitle&gt;Human erythroleukemia cells (K562; alpha4-, beta7‑ and beta1+) stably expressing a human alpha4 chain and either a human beta-7, mouse beta-7 or a human/mouse chimeric beta-7 chain, were used to map Act-1 epitopes in the alpha4beta7 integrin [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="386941"&gt;386941&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Using flow cytometry, Act-1 demonstrated recognition of a region of amino acids at position 231 to 281 of the human beta7 chain compared with a negative control antibody. In a further experiment, Act-1 demonstrated specific binding and functional inhibition of a alpha4beta7 integrin that contained a beta7 chain with Ser250 (specific to human beta7), but not with Asp250 (specific to mouse beta7) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="386941"&gt;386941&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In an immunohistochemical analysis of 38 healthy human tissue samples, labeled vedolizumab bound to mononuclear cell membranes of lymphoid tissues, mononuclear cell infiltrates in the gastrointestinal tract and bladder, and to mononuclear cells in the lumen of blood vessels [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1039913"&gt;1039913&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1102734"&gt;1102734&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1130726"&gt;1130726&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Vedolizumab also bound eosinophils at high to intermediate levels, while binding other B-cells, T-cells, NK cells and basophils at intermediate to low levels. In a further analysis, T-cells bound by vedolizumab expressed low levels of the beta1 chain; vedolizumab bound to ~ 80% of a T-cell subset expressing alpha4hibeta1lo that contained the majority of the alpha4beta7hi-expressing subset, but did not bind to the majority of the T-cell subsets expressing alpha4hibeta1hi or alpha4lobeta1hi (90 and 100% remained unbound, respectively). Similarly, 85% of monocytes that expressed high levels of alpha4beta1 were not bound by vedolizumab. In other experiments, vedolizumab demonstrated binding to ~ 20% of a proinflammatory Th17-expressing memory CD4+ T-cell subset of PBMCs isolated from human peripheral blood. Using saturation binding curves, the estimated ED50 values determined for the binding of labeled vedolizumab to B-cells and memory CD4+ T-cells in human peripheral blood were 0.067 (0.4 nM) and 0.042 microg/ml (0.3 nM), respectively. In competitive binding experiments with labeled and unlabeled vedolizumab, the estimated mean IC50 values determined for the binding of labeled vedolizumab to B-cells and memory CD4+ T-cells were 0.045 (0.3 nM) and 0.044 microg/ml (0.3 nM), respectively. In comparative competitive binding experiments, the IC50 values determined for labeled Act-1 binding to B-cell and memory CD4+ T-cells were 0.062 (0.01 nM) and 0.059 microg/ml (0.008 nM), respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1039913"&gt;1039913&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In ELISA experiments using an alpha4beta7-expressing human B-cell lymphoma cell line (RMPI18866), low- and high-affinity adhesion to MAdCAM-1 was inhibited by vedolizumab with mean IC50 values of 0.023 and 0.058 microg/ml, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1039913"&gt;1039913&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1102734"&gt;1102734&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1130726"&gt;1130726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition, vedolizumab inhibited the adhesion of RMPI18866 cells to fibronectin with a mean IC50 value of 0.02 microg/ml. In contrast, vedolizumab (&amp;lt;/= 400 microg/ml) did not inhibit the low- and high-affinity adhesion of RMPI18866 cells to VCAM-1. An anti-alpha4 mAb inhibited adhesion of RMPI18866 cells to MAdCAM-1, fibronectin and VCAM-1, while a humanized control mAb and a murine isotype-matched control mAb had no effect on RMPI18866 cell adhesion. In flow cytometry experiments with human whole blood, vedolizumab inhibited the binding of alpha4beta7hi-expressing T-cells to a soluble human MAdCAM-1-crystallizable fragment protein with an IC50 value of 0.034 microg/ml. In experiments using an alpha4beta1-expressing human B-cell lymphoma cell line (RAMOS), vedolizumab (&amp;lt;/= 400 microg/ml) did not inhibit the low- or high-affinity adhesion to VCAM-1, while single or combined anti-alpha4 and -beta1 mAbs inhibited all adhesion of RAMOS cells to VCAM-1. Similarly, vedolizumab (&amp;lt;/= 400 microg/ml) did not inhibit the adhesion of RAMOS cells to fibronectin, while single or combined anti-alpha4 and -beta1 mAbs inhibited all adhesion of RAMOS cells to fibronectin [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1039913"&gt;1039913&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;In vivo&lt;/subtitle&gt;Colitic cotton-top tamarins were treated with Act-1 or an isotype-matched control mAb (both at 2 mg/kg single iv bolus, followed by 2 mg/kg im, qd for seven doses) and colonic biopsies were examined on days 0, 5, 10 and 20 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="386933"&gt;386933&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Immunohistochemistry with a murine IgG detected labeling on mononuclear cell membranes in the colonic mucosal lamina propria in biopsies from the Act-1 group by day 10, while no labeling was detected in colonic biopsies from the control mAb group. The colonic inflammatory activity (defined using a histological scoring method) of biopsies from the Act-1 group was significantly decreased compared with baseline at all time points (p &amp;lt; 0.05), while the colonic inflammatory activity of biopsies from the control mAb group was unchanged from baseline. Using a quantitative morphometric analysis to enumerate the density of colonic mucosal leukocytes in both groups, a significant decrease from baseline in beta7+ mononuclear leukocytes (31.6 and 40.2% decrease by day 10 and 20, respectively), T-cells (49.6 and 24.1% decrease by day 5 and 10, respectively), B-cells (46.9 and 38.7% decrease by day 5 and 20, respectively), neutrophils (42.5 and 38.9% decrease by day 10 and 20, respectively) and macrophages (29.7 and 41.5% decrease by day 5, and days 10 and 20, respectively) was observed in the Act-1 group, while a similar or increased density of leukocytes from baseline was observed in the control mAb group. In daily analyses, an improvement from baseline in stool consistency, from diarrhea to at least semi-solid stool, was observed within 24 h of Act-1 administration in all tamarins and improvement from baseline to solid stool was observed in all tamarins within 72 h, while improvement in stool consistency was not observed the control mAb group [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="386933"&gt;386933&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Healthy cynomolgus macaques administered with vedolizumab (10, 30 or 100 mg/kg iv, q2w for 26 weeks) were examined for systemic immune function [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1102734"&gt;1102734&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116682"&gt;1116682&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128856"&gt;1128856&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1130726"&gt;1130726&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Following vedolizumab administration, asymptomatic depletion of Peyer's patches (lymphoid nodules usually found in the small intestine ileum) was variably observed in the gastrointestinal tract at necropsy. Vedolizumab administration decreased the frequency of lymphocytes expressing the beta7 chain in peripheral blood, while concomitantly increasing the frequency of memory helper alpha4beta7+ T-cells by 2- to 3-fold. Vedolizumab administration did not elicit a change in the number of memory helper alpha4beta7-, helper or cytotoxic T-cells, or neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, B-cells, monocytes or NK cells in peripheral blood [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128856"&gt;1128856&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;Colitic cotton-top tamarins were administered with Act-1 or an isotype-matched control mAb (both at 2 mg/kg single iv bolus, followed by 2 mg/kg im, qd for seven doses) and blood was analyzed for routine clinical chemistry parameters and absolute numbers of alpha4beta7+ lymphocytes at five time points between days 0 and 10 and on day 20 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="386933"&gt;386933&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Act-1 was well tolerated and no changes were observed in liver and renal function test results during and after the study. Act-1 administration was not associated with leukopenia, while during the first study week when daily manipulation and anesthesia was used during mAb administration, neutrophilia was observed in all study animals, including animals administered with the control mAb. The cytotoxic T-cell count increased from a typical healthy range of 1.4 to 12.0 x 10(3) cells/microl to &amp;lt;/= 40.0 x 10(3) cells/microl.

In blood from the control mAb-treated animals, 70 to 90% of lymphocytes were labeled following exposure to labeled Act-1, whereas in blood from the Act-1-treated animals, there was no significant labeling of lymphocytes.

Furthermore, the increase from baseline in the number of patients with a healthy level of serum C-reactive protein (&gt;/= 0.8 mg/dl) on day 57 was greater in the 2-mg/kg group compared with placebo (23 versus 4%; p = 0.018). HAHA titers &gt;/= 1:125 developed in 34% of the 0.5-mg/kg vedolizumab group versus 12% in the 2.0-mg/kg vedolizumab group, again demonstrating that lower doses were associated with greater HAHA development; clinically significant HAHA titers were associated with lower remission rates [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1102727"&gt;1102727&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A phase II, open-label, uncontrolled, parallel-assignment clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="17823"&gt;NCT00619489&lt;/ulink&gt;; C13004) was ongoing in patients (estimated n = 80) with confirmed or active CD (defined as a CDAI score between 220 and 450) or UC (defined as a partial MCS between 2 and 7). Vedolizumab was administered to patients intravenously on days 1, 15 and 43, and then every 8 weeks for up to 78 weeks; patients with no prior exposure to vedolizumab would receive a 6-mg/kg dose and patients enrolled from the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="68920"&gt;NCT01177228&lt;/ulink&gt; phase II trial would receive a 2-mg/kg dose. Treatment and observation periods were estimated to last ~ 21 months. The primary outcome was a measure of long-term safety, including an assessment of HAHA development. This trial was scheduled for completion in June 2010, although data were not available at the time of publication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;At the time of publication, three phase III, multicenter clinical trials assessing vedolizumab were recruiting patients with moderate to severe UC or CD. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover-assignment clinical trials in patients with UC (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="33334"&gt;NCT00783718&lt;/ulink&gt;; C13006, GEMINI I; estimated n = 826) and in patients with CD (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="33335"&gt;NCT00783692&lt;/ulink&gt;; C13007, GEMINI II; estimated n = 1059) were designed with two phases to assess vedolizumab (administered in weeks 0, 2, 6 and then every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks for &amp;lt;/= 1 year) for the induction and maintenance of clinical response and remission. The trials had estimated completion dates in the second half of 2012. Patients (estimated n = 1500) completing these two phase III trials or the &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="17823"&gt;NCT00619489&lt;/ulink&gt; phase II trial would be invited to enroll for a follow-up, open-label, non-randomized, single-group-assignment clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="35865"&gt;NCT00790933&lt;/ulink&gt;; C13008; GEMINI III) that was designed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of continued vedolizumab (every 4 weeks &amp;lt;/= 100 weeks) treatment. The estimated completion date for this trial was May 2013.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side effects and contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;In an analysis of safety data from nine clinical trials (details of the individual trials were not presented) that assessed single and multiple doses of vedolizumab or its precursor (&amp;lt;/= 10 mg/kg iv, for &amp;lt;/= 4 doses) in healthy volunteers and patients with IBD, vedolizumab demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with no reported deaths [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116609"&gt;1116609&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1131436"&gt;1131436&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The number of patients reporting at least one adverse event was similar in the vedolizumab group (n = 415; 84%) and placebo group (n = 164; 87%). The most commonly reported adverse events in the vedolizumab group were headache, nausea, worsening of IBD symptoms, abdominal pain, fatigue and nasopharyngitis. Likewise, the number of patients reporting at least one serious adverse event was similar in the vedolizumab group (12%) and placebo group (14%). More patients in the vedolizumab group than in the placebo group reported at least one infection (commonly of the upper respiratory tract; 33 versus 23%), herpes labialis (2.3 versus 0.6%) and/or mucosal candidiasis (1.2 versus 0%). In the vedolizumab and placebo groups, the rates of gastrointestinal infection (overall &amp;lt;/= 1%) and serious infections (1.4 versus 1.8%) were similar and there was no increase in the incidence of systemic infections, such as pneumonia and pyelonephritis, in the vedolizumab group compared with the placebo group [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116609"&gt;1116609&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1131436"&gt;1131436&lt;/ulink&gt;]. One patient with active UC treated with vedolizumab (either 0.5 or 2.0 mg/kg iv, on days 1 and 29), developed lobar pneumonia after spinal surgery that was successfully treated [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1102723"&gt;1102723&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116609"&gt;1116609&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1131436"&gt;1131436&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No opportunistic systemic infections were observed, even in patients (n = 53) receiving at least seven doses of vedolizumab over a period of &gt;/= 1 year [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116609"&gt;1116609&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1131436"&gt;1131436&lt;/ulink&gt;]. One patient with active UC treated with vedolizumab developed a primary CMV infection 21 days after receiving a single vedolizumab infusion (either 0.5 or 2.0 mg/kg iv); however, the infection resolved without treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1102723"&gt;1102723&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116609"&gt;1116609&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1131436"&gt;1131436&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition, the rate of liver function test abnormalities was similar between groups and vedolizumab treatment was not associated with lymphocytosis or an increase in white blood cell subsets [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116609"&gt;1116609&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1131436"&gt;1131436&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Data was disclosed from an ongoing retrospective analysis of serum samples for JC viremia (assay sensitivity of 30 copies/ml) from healthy volunteers and patients with IBD enrolled in nine clinical trials (including ongoing phase III trials) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116609"&gt;1116609&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Analysis of serum from patients (n = 800) who had received 1 to 19 doses of vedolizumab over a period of &gt;/= 2.5 years demonstrated no association between vedolizumab exposure and viremia, with an incidence of &amp;lt; 1% [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128802"&gt;1128802&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this analysis, five patients tested positive for JC virus (30 to 800 copies/ml), which had resolved in subsequent tests, and there was no observed association between the incidence of viremia and vedolizumab treatment duration. There were no changes in the lymphocyte and circulating CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell counts (increased counts are associated with an increased incidence of PML following &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;) in the vedolizumab groups relative to placebo. Furthermore, there were no changes in the frequency of CD34+ cells observed in the peripheral circulation in a short-term analysis, at vedolizumab Cmax or following vedolizumab clearance (~ day 141) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128802"&gt;1128802&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In multiple-dose clinical trials, &amp;lt; 1% of patients developed a reaction after receiving an infusion of vedolizumab. One patient with UC enrolled in the phase II trial that assessed vedolizumab (0.5 or 2.0 mg/kg iv, on days 1 and 29) developed hives and mild angioedema during the second infusion (dose unspecified) and an antibody titer against vedolizumab of 1:3125 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1102723"&gt;1102723&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116609"&gt;1116609&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1131436"&gt;1131436&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Serious adverse events reported by at least one patient completing the phase II clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="17699"&gt;NCT00655135&lt;/ulink&gt;; L299-016) that assessed vedolizumab (0.5 or 2.0 mg/kg iv, on days 1 and 29) in patients (n = 185) with active CD included small bowel obstruction (one case in each group) and nephrolithiasis (two cases presenting as calculus renal and renal colic in the 2-mg/kg vedolizumab group) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1102727"&gt;1102727&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Two patients discontinued the trial because of worsening Crohn's disease symptoms [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1102727"&gt;1102727&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Patent summary&lt;/subtitle&gt;Vedolizumab was first claimed by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="27414"&gt;LeukoSite&lt;/ulink&gt; in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="IN2791330"&gt;WO-09806248&lt;/ulink&gt;.

In three large trials in patients with CD, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was more effective than placebo on response and remission criteria [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="503611"&gt;503611&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="811696"&gt;811696&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="931904"&gt;931904&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;Natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was further evaluated in patients with multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Notably, several cases of PML developed during treatment with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128845"&gt;1128845&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128846"&gt;1128846&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128847"&gt;1128847&lt;/ulink&gt;]. An analysis of data generated from trials with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; predicted a ~ 1:1000 risk of PML in patients treated for a mean of 17.9 months [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="653435"&gt;653435&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A Cochrane analysis of available trial data recommended that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; was effective for induction of clinical response and remission in some patients with moderate to severely active CD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128849"&gt;1128849&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Preliminary data from a retrospective investigation of adverse events associated with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; indicated that patients at risk for PML could be identified by testing for the appearance of JC virus in plasma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128849"&gt;1128849&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The FDA recently communicated that the risk of developing PML increases with the number of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; infusions received. This new safety information, based on reports of 31 confirmed cases of PML received by the FDA by January 2010, has now been included in the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6692"&gt;natalizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; drug label and patient Medication Guide [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128871"&gt;1128871&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1128872"&gt;1128872&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Because of the similarities in mechanism of action, PML remains a major theoretical concern for vedolizumab therapy and needs exceptional awareness because appearance of such a complication would threaten the whole vedolizumab program.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Anti-TNFalpha therapies have dominated the last decade of biological research into innovative therapies for IBD. These drugs have defined a benchmark for the efficacy of anti-cytokine therapies in patients who are refractory to immunomodulators. However, a considerable number of patients do not respond initially or lose response over time to anti-TNFalpha therapies. Therefore, other approaches targeting different immune mediators are needed to improve patient care. Interference with homing of inflammatory cells to the gut might be a favorable approach for the future treatment of IBD and vedolizumab, a humanized mAb targeting the alpha4beta7 integrin, represents such an approach.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Data generated from large phase II clinical trials with vedolizumab have indicated that the approach might be efficacious in patients with UC, whereas data from trials in CD have been less convincing. Overall, the toxicity profile of vedolizumab appears to be rather promising, with patients in vedolizumab groups experiencing more generally mild and self-limited infections than in placebo groups. This concurs with the toxicity profile of other potent anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of IBD and, in the authors' views, local, mucosal infections might be the main safety concern. Severe systemic opportunistic infections have not been observed so far, even when patients were cotreated with other immunosuppressants.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An important issue of treatment with humanized mAbs is the development of HAHAs because they could negatively affect efficacy by neutralizing the compound and decreasing alpha4beta7 receptor saturation. In the phase II clinical trial in patients (n = 181) with active UC, the appearance of HAHAs may have influenced clinical efficacy because the 24% of patients with a HAHA titer &gt;/= 1:125 demonstrated a loss of saturation of alpha4beta7 binding sites, and remission rate in this group was similar to the remission rate in the placebo group. HAHA formation appears dose-dependent with lower vedolizumab doses leading to higher titers. Yet despite the development of HAHAs, hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely observed (&amp;lt; 1% of treated patients). In this phase II trial, vedolizumab was more effective than placebo for the induction of clinical and endoscopic remission in patients with active UC. However, only one-third of the vedolizumab-treated patients went into remission, and the trial did not include patients treated with a concomitant corticosteroid/immunosuppressant. A Cochrane analysis was published evaluating the role of antibodies to the alpha4beta7 integrin for induction of remission in UC [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1116607"&gt;1116607&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This analysis included only this phase II trial and concluded that vedolizumab might be effective for induction of response and/or remission in this indication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;For a final assessment of a potential role of vedolizumab in both UC and CD, we need the results of the ongoing phase III clinical trials. The results will provide important information regarding the best practice for dosing with vedolizumab before or after anti-TNF therapies and with or without concomitant immunosuppressants, and will also provide data on mucosal healing in UC, which is an increasingly important aspect in IBD trials [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1102738"&gt;1102738&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Currently, treatment strategies for IBD favor interference with inflammatory mediators or recruitment of inflammatory cells into the gut. This approach might be the best strategy for severe acute disease but probably not ideal as a long-term strategy. As the underlying mechanisms in these diseases are still insufficiently understood, it is hoped that a better understanding of disease processes will also help to evolve treatment strategies for the chronic and less inflammatory phases of these diseases where therapies should help to repair barrier and immune functions.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="20300">Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd</Company><Country id="US">US</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="L"
