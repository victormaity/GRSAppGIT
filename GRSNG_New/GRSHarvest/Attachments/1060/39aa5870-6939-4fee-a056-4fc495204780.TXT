It was launched in Canada in February 2001 [&lt;ulink linkID="399245" linkType="reference"&gt;399245&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A US phase III trial had been completed, and as of February 2002, plans for a second phase III trial were underway [&lt;ulink linkID="438116" linkType="reference"&gt;438116&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="441740" linkType="reference"&gt;441740&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="448849" linkType="reference"&gt;448849&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2002, licensee, Schering-Plough, terminated its agreement with Corixa, and at that time, the company was in discussions with other potential collaborators [&lt;ulink linkID="460679" linkType="reference"&gt;460679&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, in November 2003, Corixa opted to discontinue US development based on extra phase III trials being required for approval [&lt;ulink linkID="511880" linkType="reference"&gt;511880&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;AS MONOTHERAPY&lt;/subtitle&gt;In November 1999, Corixa received regulatory approval for the sale of Melacine as a monotherapy for the treatment of stage II melanoma in Canada [&lt;ulink linkID="346364" linkType="reference"&gt;346364&lt;/ulink&gt;] and it had been launched there, by Schering Canada, by May 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="365454" linkType="reference"&gt;365454&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="399245" linkType="reference"&gt;399245&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2000, Corixa announced that it intended to file a BLA for Melacine for stage II melanoma in the US in the second quarter of 2001, based on the data from an 8-year phase III study [&lt;ulink linkID="383801" linkType="reference"&gt;383801&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="386818" linkType="reference"&gt;386818&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in June 2001, following a reanalysis of overall disease-free survival of this phase III study, showing no statistical significance, discussions with the FDA were ongoing regarding the possibilities of filing a BLA [&lt;ulink linkID="413144" linkType="reference"&gt;413144&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2002, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory committee reviewed completed phase III data and endorsed a second phase III trial design, expected to take 10 years, with overall survival as the primary endpoint. The aim of the study was to replicate findings of the 10-year completed SWOG 9035 study [&lt;ulink linkID="438116" linkType="reference"&gt;438116&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="441740" linkType="reference"&gt;441740&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="451216" linkType="reference"&gt;451216&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="448849" linkType="reference"&gt;448849&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2001, Corixa completed a 17-month data sweep associated with the completed pivotal trial of Melacine for stage II melanoma. In an effort to provide the FDA with updated information, Corixa decided to obtain additional mortality and disease recurrence data on as many patients as possible, prior to proceeding with completion of a BLA filing. &lt;ulink linkID="28926" linkType="Company"&gt;The FDA&lt;/ulink&gt; pointed out that approval of Melacine in the US would require a confirmatory clinical trial in class I MHC HLA A2 and C3 positive patients. Corixa was to review the potential for cost recovery associated with such a study before reaching a final decision regarding the regulatory path for Melacine registration in the US, as well as its continued support for the program [&lt;ulink linkID="427555" linkType="reference"&gt;427555&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2002, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee endorsed Corixa's proposed design for its second phase III trial. The trial was to evaluate Melacine vaccine versus observation in HLA A2 and/or HLA C3 positive, stage II melanoma patients following surgery. Primary endpoint was set as overall survival [&lt;ulink linkID="441740" linkType="reference"&gt;441740&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2000, Corixa had intended to file for regulatory approval of Melacine with the US FDA for the treatment of stage II melanoma [&lt;ulink linkID="383801" linkType="reference"&gt;383801&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="387667" linkType="reference"&gt;387667&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The filing was to be based on data from a phase III trial of Melacine to prevent recurrence in patients with stage II melanoma [&lt;ulink linkID="387667" linkType="reference"&gt;387667&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patient accrual for the trial was completed in November 1996 [&lt;ulink linkID="244807" linkType="reference"&gt;244807&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="303262" linkType="reference"&gt;303262&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="337569" linkType="reference"&gt;337569&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2000, the Southwest Oncology Group presented results of the trial. There was no significant difference in disease-free survival in the eligible patient population between the patients randomized to be treated with Melacine and patients randomized to observation alone. However, in the intent-to-treat analysis on the total population, there was a significant difference in disease-free survival between the patients treated with Melacine (103/346 patients died or relapsed) and patients randomized to observation alone (125/343 patients died or relapsed). It was concluded that the vaccine may have a potential benefit, especially in patients with a tumor thickness less than 3 mm [&lt;ulink linkID="356451" linkType="reference"&gt;356451&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="365454" linkType="reference"&gt;365454&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2000, additional data from this trial were presented at the Society of Biological Therapy meeting in Seattle. The investigators tested whether the association between the patient's disease and the response to Melacine could be related to their HLA phenotype; it was found that disease-free survival was significantly better in vaccinated patients who expressed two or more of the five prospectively defined HLA alleles as compared to patients with the same HLA phenotype who were not vaccinated after surgery. The effect was predominantly related to expression of HLA-A2 and HLA-C3 [&lt;ulink linkID="387667" linkType="reference"&gt;387667&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Ribi had previously submitted an MAA in Europe for the use of Melacine for the treatment of stage IV melanoma, which was granted expedited review in March 1998 [&lt;ulink linkID="282591" linkType="reference"&gt;282591&lt;/ulink&gt;]. But this was withdrawn in November 1998, after the EMEA requested additional phase III studies [&lt;ulink linkID="303262" linkType="reference"&gt;303262&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By this time, the FDA had also reviewed data presented at a BLA meeting in July 1998, and had directed Ribi to file data that supported a claim for the durability of tumor response in stage IV melanoma patients [&lt;ulink linkID="303262" linkType="reference"&gt;303262&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, an application for FDA approval for Melacine was later refused; whilst survival increased from 150 to 380 days, trials conducted by this time did not demonstrate an improved survival rate for those who received Melacine [&lt;ulink linkID="384703" linkType="reference"&gt;384703&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By November 1999, regulatory filing of the compound in the US and Europe depended on the outcome of two ongoing phase III studies: one of the combination therapy of Melacine plus Intron A in patients with stage IV melanoma and one to study the potential of Melacine to prevent recurrence in patients with stage II melanoma [&lt;ulink linkID="346364" linkType="reference"&gt;346364&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="365454" linkType="reference"&gt;365454&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; Melacine has Orphan Drug status in both Europe and the US [&lt;ulink linkID="282591" linkType="reference"&gt;282591&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="175969" linkType="reference"&gt;175969&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The regulatory filing in Canada was based on the results of the first completed phase III trial and also those of a meta-analysis. The trial involved 140 stage IV melanoma patients and compared Melacine to a four-drug combination chemotherapy regimen (the Dartmouth Protocol). Median survival was 11.0 months for evaluable patients receiving Melacine (54 evaluable patients, 70 patients total) versus 12.4 months for evaluable patients receiving chemotherapy (52 evaluable patients, 70 patients total); a difference not considered to be significant. However, Melacine treatment was found to provide a superior quality of life [&lt;ulink linkID="247075" linkType="reference"&gt;247075&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="337569" linkType="reference"&gt;337569&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The meta-analysis, dating from 1974 to 1995, involving 78 clinical studies comparing Melacine with other therapies, determined the median survival for 5630 evaluable patients to be 7.8 months [&lt;ulink linkID="247075" linkType="reference"&gt;247075&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="337569" linkType="reference"&gt;337569&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2002, clinical data on Melacine were presented at the 38th ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. An updated analysis was given on the SWOG 9035 trial, a phase III adjuvant trial of Melacine vaccine versus observation. The study confirmed that benefit from melacine was associated with the expression of HLA class I antigens [&lt;ulink linkID="452822" linkType="reference"&gt;452822&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2003, similar data were presented at the Perspectives in Melanoma Management conference in Amsterdam, the Netherlands [&lt;ulink linkID="511593" linkType="reference"&gt;511593&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;IN COMBINATION WITH INTRON A&lt;/subtitle&gt;Patient accrual for the combination phase III trial, initiated in early 1996, being conducted with Schering-Plough's Intron A (interferon alpha-2b) for the treatment of stage IV melanoma was completed in January 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="365454" linkType="reference"&gt;365454&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="337569" linkType="reference"&gt;337569&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 1998, promising interim results of this phase III study prompted a recommendation, from an independent data and safety monitoring board, to continue the study [&lt;ulink linkID="282229" linkType="reference"&gt;282229&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2001, the phase III study was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="402208" linkType="reference"&gt;402208&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2003, interim phase III data on Melacine plus Intron A were presented at the 39th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL. A total of 600 patients with resected stage III melanoma were randomized to receive either a Melacine and low-dose Intron A (5 x 10(6) U/m2, 3 times a week) combination administered over two years, or high-dose Intron A (ECOG 1690 schedule) given over one year. An 'intent-to-treat'-based analysis was performed on 455 patients; 26 patients (12%) randomized to the high-dose Intron A arm did not receive treatment, compared to 14 (6%) patients randomized to the combination arm. In the combination arm 22 severe adverse events (incuding autoimmune neuropathy, osteomyelitis and retinopathy) were possibily/probably related to the treatment, whereas in the high-dose Intron A arm there were 28 severe adverse events (including one suicide, one suicide attempt, severe depression and seizures) possibly related to the treatment. Relapse-free survival and overall survival were not significantly different between the two arms; median relapse free-free survival was 31 months (95% CI) for the combination and 25 months (95% CI) for high-dose Intron A (p = 0.85). Although disease-free survival was similar in both groups, toxicity was less severe in the combination group; median overall survival had not yet been reached [&lt;ulink linkID="492032" linkType="reference"&gt;492032&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><AdditionalInformation><displayLabel>Additional Information</displayLabel><value>&lt;AdditionalInformation&gt;&lt;para&gt;The epitopes for the vaccine are derived from a lysate of two human melanoma cell lines, and the immunogenicity is boosted by the use of Detox adjuvant, which contains monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and mycobacterial cell wall skeleton [&lt;ulink linkID="177766" linkType="reference"&gt;177766&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The melanoma tumor associated antigens were originally developed at the &lt;ulink linkID="20673" linkType="Company"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/ulink&gt;, from whom Ribi obtained exclusive marketing rights [&lt;ulink linkID="175969" linkType="reference"&gt;175969&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 1998, Schering-Plough acquired exclusive worldwide rights, except for Canada, to distribute, market and sell melacine [&lt;ulink linkID="281239" linkType="reference"&gt;281239&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 1998, Schering-Plough become the exclusive worldwide licensee, following &lt;ulink linkID="14774" linkType="Company"&gt;Biomira&lt;/ulink&gt; relinquishing its Canadian rights to melacine [&lt;ulink linkID="290135" linkType="reference"&gt;290135&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2002, Corixa reacquired worldwide rights to melacine from Schering-Plough [&lt;ulink linkID="460679" linkType="reference"&gt;460679&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By 1993, Ribi had rights to use Lidak's large, multivalent, immunogen technology for melanoma vaccine development [&lt;ulink linkID="178189" linkType="reference"&gt;178189&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/AdditionalInformation&gt;</value></AdditionalInformation></DevelopmentProfile><ExpertReview>&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;8 June 1999&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;Adjuvants are compounds which enhance or maximize specific immune reactivity by promoting antigen presentation and availability, and whose composition includes the material itself and its vehicle. Alum, an aluminum salt, was the first compound shown to enhance immune responses to an immunogen. Although possessing an excellent safety record, its biochemical properties make this adjuvant troublesome to manufacture reproducibly [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="226304"&gt;226304&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A major advancement was the development of several non-toxic derivatives of lipid A, the portion of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria which possesses powerful adjuvant activity. One such derivative is monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL-A), obtained from a series of 4?-monophosphoryl lipid A derivatives originating in the Salmonella minnesota lipopolysaccharide. These deviate from one another in the number and position of fatty acid substitutions [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="226304"&gt;226304&lt;/ulink&gt;]. MPL administration has been associated with positive immunomodulation as well as enhancement of endotoxin tolerance [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="40495"&gt;40495&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This moiety, when complexed with the cytoskeleton of mycobacteria form the adjuvant DETOX. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;Melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; is an allogeneic tumor vaccine admixed with DETOX. The cellular component is comprised of lysates from two allogeneic, established melanoma cell lines. It enhances immune reactivity in a nonspecific, systemic manner, comparable to the mode of action of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) an attenuated form of Mycobacterium bovis specially developed to augment antigen delivery [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="226306"&gt;226306&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;MPL elicits rapid build-up of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in vaccinated mice that is strongly associated with primed macrophages. Such macrophages produce nitric oxide which enhances their viability and abrogate lipopolysaccharide-associated mortality [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="170080"&gt;170080&lt;/ulink&gt;]. MPL demonstrates minimal toxicity and strong stimulation of cytotoxic factors in a murine model when administered intravenously. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like response that was elicited was heat-stable, effective in xenogeneic systems, and more efficacious against Lewis lung carcinoma cells as compared with a normal established cell line [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="170075"&gt;170075&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;MPL elicits interferon-gamma production by T-lymphocytes, as well as IL-1 secretion by macrophages [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="226304"&gt;226304&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;Twenty-two metastatic melanoma patients were injected five times over a course of six weeks with 10, 20, or 40 million tumor-cell equivalents of two melanoma cell lines admixed with DETOX. No toxicity and only slight local skin reactivity was observed [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="226307"&gt;226307&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a phase II trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; with 139 patients with stage IV disseminated malignant melanoma, no toxicity was noted. Minor side effects included pain (37%), granulomas (13%), erythema (6%), as well as flu-associated symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia (14%), fever (14%), chills (5%), and headache (14%) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="170072"&gt;170072&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;Two complete and three partial remissions resulted from the active specific immunotherapy of 17 malignant melanoma patients with mechanically-disrupted allogeneic melanoma cell lines admixed with DETOX. No maximum tolerable dose was established due to the lack of toxicity observed at all treatment levels [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="226307"&gt;226307&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Unlike results using chemotherapy, overall survival rates were enhanced without having to achieve complete clinical remission [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="195386"&gt;195386&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;Overall survival remained constant in an initial group of 25 patients, with a median length of response of 17 months. However, this is in contrast to the 6- to 12-month median survival of melanoma patients receiving chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="195386"&gt;195386&lt;/ulink&gt;]. When this cohort was expanded to 139 patients, a slight therapeutic effect was observed in 139 patients with stage III and IV melanoma who received five injections of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; over the course of 6 weeks. Four (3%) showed a complete clinical response and seven (5%) a partial clinical response with a median duration of five months. No toxicity and only mild inflammatory responses were observed [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="170072"&gt;170072&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Those demonstrating stable or regressive disease had an increased median overall survival of 21 months [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="195308"&gt;195308&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The 18 patients who failed treatment were subsequently treated with 5x10(6) U/m2/d of IFN-alpha, 3 times per week. This resulted in a 44% major objective clinical response rate, including five complete remissions, with a median survival duration &amp;gt; 32 months [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="195308"&gt;195308&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The encouraging results obtained with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; plus IFN-alpha has led to FDA approval of phase III studies of stage II (primary) and IV (disseminated) melanoma comparing &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; plus IFN-alpha with IFN-alpha alone [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="177766"&gt;177766&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By the end of 1998, 38 patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma had completed treatment and were evaluable. One complete response (2.6%), 3 partial responses (7.9%), and 21 cases of stable disease (55.3%) were reported. Researchers have been unable to discern why the second trial with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; plus IFN-alpha did not achieve the partial response rates of the first. However, only about one-third of all enrolled patients demonstrated progressive disease during treatment. And at present, the median survival is over 13 months [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="327262"&gt;327262&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;The outcome of the initial phase III clinical trial of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; as a stand-alone agent was disappointing [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="177230"&gt;177230&lt;/ulink&gt;]. An interim report demonstrated that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; was equivalent, but not superior, to the multidrug regiment known as the Dartmouth Protocol [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="195779"&gt;195779&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although one type of statistical analysis demonstrated that &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; significantly increased overall survival [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="195779"&gt;195779&lt;/ulink&gt;], this approach compared &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; against 26 other clinical trials grouped as one for comparison. In a subsequent, current study, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; has been combined with Schering Plough�s Intron A (interferon alfa-2b) for treatment of stage IV melanoma. This trial will compare a high-dose interferon-alpha regimen from the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="24771"&gt;Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&lt;/ulink&gt; (20 million U/m2 iv for 4 weeks, followed by 10 million U/m2 three times per week sc for the balance of a year), against &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; and interferon-alpha at 5 10(6) U/m2, 3 times per week, starting 4 weeks following the initial administration of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt;. A full accrual of 300 to 400 subjects was anticipated by the beginning of 1999, with final results expected 12 months later [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="327262"&gt;327262&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients tolerated &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; therapy more easily than the Dartmouth Protocol, providing an improved quality of life [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="174619"&gt;174619&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side-effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;No major side effects were observed. Occasional minor side effects (slight fever, inflammatory responses at injection site) were indistinguishable from general responses to any vaccination. Adverse events are much less common and severe as compared with chemotherapy. In a multicenter phase III clinical trial, no grade 3 and a single grade 4 toxicity was observed � as compared with 86 grade 3 and 4 adverse events associated with chemotherapy. Adverse effects related to the Detox component usually resolve upon cessation of the adjuvant [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="327262"&gt;327262&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Fatigue is frequently noted in patients receiving adjuvant therapy with IFN-alpha [4].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;The phase III clinical trial with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt;, one of the most advanced human studies to date, produced a disappointingly low percentage of complete and partial responders. When used alone, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; demonstrated no survival advantage over established chemotherapeutics for the treatment of widely disseminated melanoma, although the quality of life was better during &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment. Statistical comparisons of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; versus individual immunotherapeutic protocols, instead of 26 grouped as one entity, has not been reported. However, more recently, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; has demonstrated a promising clinical impact when combined with adjuvant Intron A (IFN-alpha-2b). That is, the median duration of the stable responses appears relatively durable, despite the observation that the percentage of partial and complete responders remains at about 10% [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="327262"&gt;327262&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Thus, this cytokine has significantly enhanced patient responses following &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="177766"&gt;177766&lt;/ulink&gt;]. IFN-alpha has also demonstrated its activity against melanoma in other studies [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="228472"&gt;228472&lt;/ulink&gt;], as well as when administered with Maxamine, an H2 receptor agonist that prolongs the lifespan of anti-tumor NK cells [228474]. Ultimately, it would be preferable to have a formal comparison between &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7192"&gt;melacine&lt;/ulink&gt; and similar studies from this group using frozen lysates � the latter being another promising approach in phase II and III clinical development. Certainly it remains desirable to build on previous work in order to increase the percentage of patients demonstrating partial/complete responses rather than mixed/stable clinical disease.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="15542">Corixa Corp</Company><Country id="CA">Canada</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="L"
