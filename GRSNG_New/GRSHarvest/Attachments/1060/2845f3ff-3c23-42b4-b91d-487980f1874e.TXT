Data demonstrated the effectiveness in reducing allergic rhinitis and asthma medication intake of upto 65% in 9,001 patients treated with allergy immunotherapy  (AIT).  Data also showed that, 49% of AIT patients using asthma therapy at baseline were asthma medication free during the follow-up period compared to 35% of non-AIT patients.

In monoallergic patients, rhinoconjunctivitis score was reduced by 52%, while in polyallergic patients, rhinoconjunctivitis score decreased by 53%. The drug decreased the use of rescue medication and was well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="1447457" linkType="Reference"&gt;1447457&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2014, further data were presented at the 2014 EAACI Congress in Copenhagen, Denmark. A total of 365 patients completed treatment, and after two years, 74.2% of patients were fully controlled compared with 22.8% after first year. In controlled patients, the rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma scores decreased by 66 and 71%, respectively, compared with 8 and 45% in non-controlled patients. Prior to treatment, rescue medicine was used in 83% of patients, decreased to 58 and 38% in years 1 and 2 of treatment, respectively. Overall the treatment was rated good or very good by patients.

In June 2014, further data were presented at the same conference. In the overall population, the rhino-conjunctivitis score used in routine practice was reduced by 53% and the conjunctivitis score was reduced by 55%. Similar reductions in rhino-conjunctivitis score were observed in subgroups of children and adolescents [&lt;ulink linkID="1566951" linkType="Reference"&gt;1566951&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2012, data from a two-year, non-interventional, open, prospective, non-controlled, multicenter study conducted across Germany were reported at the EAACI Annual Congress in Geneva, Switzerland. After the first year of the study, 529 of 652 patients were included in the interim analysis. During the first year of the study, a 35% reduction  in the rhinitis score was observed  after the first year of the study, and the conjunctivitis score was reduced by 44%. The rhinoconjunctivitis score showed a 39% reduction. The rate of patients, who required symptomatic medication, was reduced from 81 to 59%. The rhinoconjunctivitis score was reduced by 50 and 41% in children and adolescents, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1302182" linkType="Reference"&gt;1302182&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later that month, further data were presented at the same conference. Of 529 patients, 93% of patients rated the tolerability of the treatment as very good or good; the tolerability was rated as poor by only 2% of patients. At the end of the first  year, 85% of patients had an improvement in well-being [&lt;ulink linkID="1302186" linkType="Reference"&gt;1302186&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2009, a confirmatory phase III trial was planned [&lt;ulink linkID="1042410" linkType="Reference"&gt;1042410&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in October 2009, the  trial was scheduled to take place in the 2011 pollen season [&lt;ulink linkID="1049925" linkType="Reference"&gt;1049925&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2008, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIb/III trial (&lt;ulink linkID="60497" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00901914&lt;/ulink&gt;; VO59.08) was initiated. In the study, 483 allergic rhinitis patients suffering from rhinoconjunctivitis caused by birch pollen in the 2009 season would be treated with sublingual tablets containing 12.5, 25 or 50 microg of Stalair rBetV1 or placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1043041" linkType="Reference"&gt;1043041&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2009, data from the phase IIb/III study were expected in the second half of 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="1026017" linkType="Reference"&gt;1026017&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2009, data from the trial were reported. The primary endpoint of a reduction in the average adjusted symptom score was met with a significant reduction in each Stalair rBetV1 group compared with placebo and a 25% reduction over the whole season. The drug was also well tolerated at each dose but more so at the 12.5 and 25 mg doses [&lt;ulink linkID="1042410" linkType="Reference"&gt;1042410&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2016, further data were presented at the 60th EAACI Congress in Vienna, Austria. Recombinant Bet v 1 was safe, and had efficacy similar to the one observed with a birch pollen extract [&lt;ulink linkID="1783766" linkType="Reference"&gt;1783766&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Other Studies&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2016, data from an open, prospective, multicenter, non-interventional observational study conducted in 75 German study centers, performed to evaluate the patient benefit index of sublingual immunotherapy with 300 IR birch pollen extract, in patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis were presented at the 60th EAACI Congress in Vienna, Austria. During the first treatment year of 291 patients, 212 were evaluated. The most important needs “to have less nasal symptoms (runny/stuffed-up nose)” and “to be able to stay outdoors without symptoms” rated by more than 85% of patients as “quite” or “very important” were achieved as “quite” or “very” by 43.6 to 51.7% of  patients. A mean patient benefit index of 2.2 (0 = no benefit, 4 = maximum benefit) was achieved by patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1783794" linkType="Reference"&gt;1783794&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Subcutaneous immunotherapy&lt;/subtitle&gt;At the end of 2002, a multicenter phase I/II trial of rBetV1 was launched across Europe in Austria, Denmark, France, Italy and Sweden,  in  patients with allergy to birch pollen, comparing it to Alustal:  the drug was well tolerated. In 2003, results were expected in 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="652930" linkType="Reference"&gt;652930&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="652931" linkType="Reference"&gt;652931&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="652916" linkType="Reference"&gt;652916&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2006, the company reported results from a randomized, double-blinded study (DV08.01; NCT004410930), which randomized 150 patients to receive commercial extract (Alustal), Stalair rBet v1, purified Bet v 1, or placebo. The three active groups showed a significant improvement of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms, compared with placebo, after years 1 and 2. These patients were also less likely to use rescue medication than placebo-treated subjects. There was no difference in results between the three active groups except for on anaphylactic reaction in the natural Bet v 1 group [&lt;ulink linkID="654813" linkType="Reference"&gt;654813&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1043690" linkType="Reference"&gt;1043690&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In addition to the promising efficacy demonstrated, the drug displayed a good safety profile from these trials [&lt;ulink linkID="793826" linkType="Reference"&gt;793826&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;OTHER CLINICAL DATA&lt;/subtitle&gt;In June 2014, data from a clinical study were presented at the 2014 EAACI Congress in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Single rising doses were administered in multidose regimens. Patients (n = 112) received either Stalair rBetV1 at doses of 12.5 microg to 300 microg (n = 84) or placebo for two weeks. No serious adverse events occurred, and the most common side effects were related to the administration site. However, 16 patients withdrew from the study, ten due to treatment-related adverse events. Generally, it was well tolerated at doses of 50 microg with or without a titration phase; incremental doses of 100 microg or more or single doses of 150 microg were not well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkID="995008" linkType="Reference"&gt;995008&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1016643" linkType="Reference"&gt;1016643&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2013, preclinical data were presented at the 2013 ECAAI-WAO meeting in Milan, Italy.

Oralair Birch is being developed by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes SA&lt;/ulink&gt; and Canadian licensee &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="27477"&gt;Paladin Labs Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;. Oralair Birch is a recombinant protein that is synthesized from the DNA coding region of Bet v 1a, the major birch pollen allergen. During preclinical characterization, Oralair Birch had comparable structural and biological properties to the natural Bet v 1 allergen. However, Oralair Birch was more homologous than the natural Bet v 1 allergen, making a greater level of quality control possible. The administration of SLIT in tablet formulation provides a more uniform dose compared with liquid drops and better local application, which might enhance local uptake into dendritic cells of the sublingual submucosa and efficacy. Using skin prick testing, the performance of recombinant Bet v 1 was comparable to the natural Bet v 1 allergen. The results of a dose-finding phase IIb/III clinical trial of Oralair Birch were positive, with the primary endpoint met by all three tested doses. A confirmatory phase III trial was planned for 2011. Oralair Birch is a very promising treatment option for patients with birch pollen allergic rhinitis.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Introduction&lt;/subtitle&gt;During the last five decades, the global incidence and prevalence of allergic rhinitis has increased, with an estimated 500 million individuals affected in 2008 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079175"&gt;1079175&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In 2001, data collated by the European Community Respiratory Health Survey suggested that approximately 35% of all European and Australasian adults have had allergic rhinitis [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085628"&gt;1085628&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood I (ISAAC I) and a follow-up study, ISAAC III, were the first worldwide efforts to construct a global map of the prevalence and prevalence trends of asthma, rhinitis and eczema in children [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079175"&gt;1079175&lt;/ulink&gt;]. From ISAAC I data, published in 1997, the global prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms in a 6- to 7-year-old and in a 13- to 14-year-old population varied between 0.8 and 14.9% and 1.4 and 39.7%, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079175"&gt;1079175&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma, and ISAAC III data published in 2006 reported a prevalence of severe asthma symptoms in the aforementioned two age groups of between 0 and 20.3% and 0.1 and 16%, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079175"&gt;1079175&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085633"&gt;1085633&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, children with asthma aged between 3 and 11 years were likely to be monosensitized to an allergen and were at increasing risk of becoming polysensitized [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1086292"&gt;1086292&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1086293"&gt;1086293&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In 2009, regional analyses of prevalence trends in the Asia-Pacific rim region documented an increased prevalence of asthma and rhinitis symptoms in lower income countries [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085635"&gt;1085635&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This was reflected by an increasing cost burden that rose from US $6.1 billion in 2000 to US $11.2 billion in 2005 for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in the US [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="995008"&gt;995008&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Allergy (also called atopy) is an altered reaction of the immune system that occurs in genetically predisposed persons in response to indoor and outdoor allergens (ie, a generally proteinaceous and non-pathogenic substance that would not normally elicit immune reactivity) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079175"&gt;1079175&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The immune response is aberrant because a protective T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) and antibody (IgM and later IgG) response is replaced with an allergic Th2 cell and antibody (IgE) response [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1086115"&gt;1086115&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Cellular events are triggered that include antigen presentation to T-cells by APCs, such as dendritic cells, which result in T-cell-mediated activation of B-cells. The B-cells are stimulated to produce allergen-specific IgE antibodies, which bind to the surface of mast cells and basophils via a high-affinity receptor for the Fc region of IgE and causes allergic sensitization in the individual [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1086115"&gt;1086115&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A skin prick/puncture test (SPT) is the preferred technique for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergic sensitization [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085648"&gt;1085648&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Subsequent contact with the allergen leads to direct degranulation of the mast cells, which release histamine and other allergy mediators. If this reaction takes place in the nasal airways and paranasal sinuses, it gives rise to the classical symptoms of nasal allergy and sinusitis, including runny nose, pruritus, sneezing and nasal obstruction. This reaction may also occur in the eyes causing symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, such as itchy/watery eyes. In later stages of the disease, inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, lymphocytes and neutrophils, arrive at the locus of the allergic inflammation and can cause irreversible tissue damage [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079175"&gt;1079175&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085649"&gt;1085649&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The main groups of allergens can be found in house dust mite feces, pollens, cat dander, molds and cockroaches (the bodies, saliva and feces contain allergens that are of particular importance in crowded urban areas) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085655"&gt;1085655&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Seasonal allergic rhinitis (also called hay fever and pollinosis) is caused by pollens from trees, grasses and weeds. Tree pollen from the birch tree (Betula verrucosa) has become a problem in some European cities, with up to 20% of the population being sensitized [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085655"&gt;1085655&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although the birch pollen season normally lasts for only 4 to 8 weeks, with a peak usually between late March and mid May, the season can be intense with pollen counts up to 9000 grains/m3 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079279"&gt;1079279&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Birch pollen contains multiple proteins, but only a small fraction of them have an allergenic potential and can be called allergens. These allergens are sequentially classified (eg, Bet v 1, followed by Bet v 2 and Bet v 3, and so forth). In the DNA coding of each of these allergens, mutations may lead to several natural variants known as isoforms. As such, for Bet v 1, there exist Bet v 1a, Bet v 1b and so on. If an allergen elicits the production of allergen-specific IgE in more than 50% of the people allergic to that substance, it is defined as a major allergen; the major birch pollen allergen is Bet v 1 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079175"&gt;1079175&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Analysis of different allergenic proteins has highlighted that some plant proteins are highly evolutionarily conserved, even between phylogenetically distinct plants [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085656"&gt;1085656&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The Bet v 2 birch allergen (also called profilin) is a highly conserved and ubiquitous allergenic protein with a similar molecular appearance to other proteins found in pollens from trees (ie, trees in the birch family, such as silver birch, alder and hazel) and also fresh fruits and vegetables [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085656"&gt;1085656&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients who are allergic to Bet v 2 are normally allergic to several pollens or plant-derived substances because of allergenic cross-reactivity [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085657"&gt;1085657&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Medical treatments available for allergic rhinitis can be subdivided into rescue and controller medications [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079175"&gt;1079175&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085649"&gt;1085649&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Rescue medications are used to rapidly relieve the acute symptoms of allergy; rescue medications include antihistamines, which block the effects caused by histamine, and decongestants, which counteract the vasodilatation that is one of the causes of nasal obstruction. Controller medications reduce the allergic inflammatory condition of the tissues. Controller medications include leukotriene inhibitors, which block the action of the leukotrienes (the principal chemo-attractant for eosinophils, which prime the individual for further allergic responses), chromones, which stabilize mast cells and also have mild anti-inflammatory action, and corticosteroids, which are potent inhibitors of inflammatory cell action [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079175"&gt;1079175&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085649"&gt;1085649&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, these treatment options only control allergy symptoms and do not cure allergic disease.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Allergen-specific immunotherapy (IT) is a medical treatment that alters the way the immune system reacts towards the clinical tolerance of a specific allergen [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085661"&gt;1085661&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085664"&gt;1085664&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This is accomplished by repeated vaccination of a patient by subcutaneous injection (SCIT) or by sublingual drops or tablets (SLIT) with a gradually augmented dose of allergen (build-up phase), followed by a maintained dose of allergen for at least 3 years (maintenance phase) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085664"&gt;1085664&lt;/ulink&gt;]. During the first weeks of IT, an augmented regulatory T-cell (also called suppressor T-cells, these cells suppress immune system activation) response can be detected with a concomitant increase in IL-10 and TGFbeta that reduces the Th2 cell activity (ie, immune-regulation), to make place for a more balanced Th1 to Th2 cell response. After approximately 12 months of IT, an increase in IFNgamma and specific IgG4-blocking antibodies is elicited, and the level of Th2 cell-derived cytokines is reduced [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079195"&gt;1079195&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079199"&gt;1079199&lt;/ulink&gt;]. After a complete course of IT, symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis and the use of rescue and controller medications are reduced for several years [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079180"&gt;1079180&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Moreover, the tendency for allergic patients to demonstrate an increasing number of new allergic sensitizations is strongly reduced, as demonstrated by house dust mite IT in children with allergic rhinitis and mild asthma and by IT with relevant allergens in patients with allergic rhinitis and/or intermittent asthma [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079182"&gt;1079182&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079183"&gt;1079183&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, in children with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis at risk of developing asthma, IT with standardized allergen extracts of grass and/or birch reduced the number of children who developed asthma after treatment termination [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="822691"&gt;822691&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079194"&gt;1079194&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;SCIT was first applied in 1911 by Noon [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085685"&gt;1085685&lt;/ulink&gt;] and Freeman [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085686"&gt;1085686&lt;/ulink&gt;] as a prophylactic inoculation with natural allergens against seasonal allergic rhinitis. The mainstay of SCIT treatment is still the administration of natural allergen extracts with or without an adjuvant. However, because the source material has natural variation, the precise allergen composition of a natural allergen extract also varies. The allergenic variation of a natural allergen extract is dependent on multiple phenomena, including the time of harvest, plant life-cycle, climate, contaminating vegetation and immune-modulating substances from culture (ie, endotoxins). As a consequence, SCIT with natural birch pollen extracts has been reported to induce new allergic sensitizations [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079283"&gt;1079283&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Apart from the variations found in allergen extracts, the two main drawbacks of SCIT are the invasive administration route and the rate of potentially fatal systemic adverse reactions [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079264"&gt;1079264&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079267"&gt;1079267&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079268"&gt;1079268&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079269"&gt;1079269&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue drives immune responses towards tolerance, so the natural immunogenic response in the oral cavity is to tolerate allergens. Moreover, the allergen delivered by SLIT onto the surface of the sublingual mucosa will only be absorbed slowly; therefore, it is harder to elicit an adverse reaction with SLIT [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079270"&gt;1079270&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079271"&gt;1079271&lt;/ulink&gt;]. As a consequence, SLIT is generally better accepted and leads to less side effects than SCIT, although the latter is still considered somewhat more effective [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1088131"&gt;1088131&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Clinical trials conducted with SLIT during the last 20 years have demonstrated that efficacy of SLIT requires much higher doses of allergen than with SCIT [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079272"&gt;1079272&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079273"&gt;1079273&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In a clinical trial that assessed the efficacy of SLIT  versus SCIT, the cumulative dose of allergen received by SLIT-treated patients was 219-fold greater than the dose received by SCIT-treated patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1082482"&gt;1082482&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;IT with one major allergen or a recombinant protein overcomes the problems of natural variations inherent in natural allergen extracts. Recombinant proteins have been developed that represent major allergens from trees and grasses including from timothy grass pollen (Phleum pratense; Phl p 5), hazel (Corylus avellana; Cor a I) and birch pollen (B verrucosa; Bet v 1) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085702"&gt;1085702&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085704"&gt;1085704&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085705"&gt;1085705&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Recombinant Bet v 1 (rBet v 1) has demonstrated similar IgE-binding capacity compared with natural Bet v 1 (nBet v 1) in immunoblot and ELISA analyses [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079299"&gt;1079299&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Moreover, the proliferation of allergen-specific T-cell clones and histamine release from basophils (both derived from patients with birch pollen allergy) induced in vitro by rBet v 1 was equivalent to nBet v 1 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079299"&gt;1079299&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Hypoallergenic variants of rBet v 1 (defined by low IgE-binding capacity) for SCIT are being evaluated in clinical trials. Results were recently presented from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial that assessed a hypoallergenic &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="58743"&gt;rBet v 1 trimer and a mixture of two rBet v 1 fragments&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18096"&gt;Allergopharma Joachim Ganzer KG&lt;/ulink&gt;) in patients (n = 124) with birch allergy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="996067"&gt;996067&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Although there was a trend for improvement in the combined rhinitis symptom-medication score, no statistically significant differences were demonstrated in comparison with placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="996067"&gt;996067&lt;/ulink&gt;]. More interesting were the results presented from an ongoing phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="25102"&gt;NCT00554983&lt;/ulink&gt;) assessing &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="58743"&gt;rBet v 1-FV&lt;/ulink&gt;, an aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed hypoallergenic rBet v 1 derivative (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="18096"&gt;Allergopharma&lt;/ulink&gt;), in patients (n = 228) with birch pollen allergy. The &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="58743"&gt;rBet v 1-FV&lt;/ulink&gt; demonstrated reduced IgE reactivity and decreased capacity to activate basophils compared with nBet v 1 and rBet v 1 in vitro [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079334"&gt;1079334&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients received 8 weekly injections in the build-up phase and a maintenance dose of 80 microg administered at 6-week intervals. After 18 months of maintenance treatment, the active group had a 32% reduction in the combined symptom-medication score, with no serious adverse events. Systemic and local reactions were more frequent in the active group. The major advantage of this treatment variant was the fast build-up phase compared with a conventional IT build-up phase of 20 to 30 injections [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="996067"&gt;996067&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes SA&lt;/ulink&gt; and Canadian licensee &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="27477"&gt;Paladin Labs Inc&lt;/ulink&gt; are developing Oralair Birch, an rBet v 1a in a SLIT tablet formulation for the treatment of allergic rhinitis caused by birch pollen [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="756466"&gt;756466&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1042410"&gt;1042410&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the time of publication, positive results from a phase IIb/III trial had been reported [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1042410"&gt;1042410&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The development of Oralair Birch will be reviewed here.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis&lt;/subtitle&gt;An Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) protein expression system was used to express the rBet v 1a protein [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="653290"&gt;653290&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A cDNA (corresponding to amino acids 1 to 483 of the wild-type Bet v 1a protein) was amplified and subcloned using restriction enzyme recognition sites (NdeI/EcoRI) into the multiple cloning region of a pMW172 expression vector (pMW172-Bet v 1a), which contained an ampicillin resistance gene. E coli transformed with the pMW172-Bet v 1a vector were grown in a 5-l bioreactor and then stored frozen in vials. YPN culture media (200 ml) containing yeast extract (1%), vegetable peptone (2%), sodium chloride (NaCl; 2%) and ampicillin (100 microg/ml) was inoculated with a thawed vial of E coli and incubated overnight at 37degC. This culture was used to inoculate a 5-l bioreactor of YPNKG culture media containing yeast extract (1.5%), vegetable peptone (0.66%), NaCl (1.5%) and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (0.3%) that had been supplemented with glucose (2%) in the absence of ampicillin. The E coli culture was fermented in the bioreactor at 37degC with stirring (300 to 1000 rpm) and aeration (20% oxygen at 750 ml/min) at pH 7 (maintained by the addition of 5 M sodium hydroxide) for 4 h to obtain log phase bacterial growth. The pMW172 expression vector was controlled by a bacteriophage T7 promoter; thus, protein expression from E coli was induced by the addition of isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside (50 ml of a 0.1 M solution). T7 RNA polymerase was provided by a prophage lambda under the conditional control of a lacUV5 promoter. After 3 h of continued fermentation, the bioreactor culture was supplemented with glucose (100 ml of a 50% solution) and was harvested after 4 h. The E coli were collected by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 30 min) and stored as cell pellets at -20degC. Thawed (4degC) E coli pellets were pooled, resuspended in 1 l of lysis buffer containing tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (50 nM), NaCl (50 nM) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (1 mM) at pH 8 and homogenized (10,000 rpm for 15 min). Homogenized E coli were then disrupted at 1200 bar and the cell lysate produced was treated with nuclease (10 IU/ml) at room temperature for 1 h and then centrifuged (8000 rpm for 60 min at 4degC). The rBet v 1a protein was precipitated from the supernatant by overnight incubation at 4degC in the presence of salts (0.76 M NaCl and 0.65 M sodium phosphate monobasic). After further centrifugation (18,000 rpm for 20 min) and filtration, the rBet v 1a protein was affinity purified via hydrophobic interaction chromatography with a phenyl-sepharose column. The rBet v 1a protein then underwent diafiltration via tangential flow filtration (Proflux M12 system/Pellicon 2 ultrafiltration module) at 4degC against tris-HCl buffer at pH 8. This was followed by a further filtration step prior to diethylaminoethyl-sepharose anion-exchange chromatography at room temperature. The rBet v 1a protein was then concentrated and diafiltrated via tangential flow filtration against NaCl (155 nM) buffer to obtain a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The purified rBet v 1a protein (Oralair Birch) was sterilized with a final filtration (Mini Kleenpak DFL filter; 0.22 microm) step and stored at -80degC [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="653290"&gt;653290&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The concentration of endotoxin in the aluminum hydroxide-absorbed vaccine formulation was &amp;lt; 0.05 endotoxin units/ml [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043690"&gt;1043690&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;The proteins rBet v 1 and nBet v 1 (derived from birch pollen extract) were purified to clinical grade and characterized in parallel; rBet v 1 and nBet v 1 had low endotoxin content (&amp;lt; 0.02 and 0.03 endotoxin units/microg, respectively) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="653290"&gt;653290&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In an analysis with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, rBet v 1 resolved mainly as an 18-kDa protein and nBet v 1 resolved as an 18- to 20-kDa mixture of proteins that were also evident in a birch pollen extract comparator; rBet v 1 had greater estimated homogeneity (ie, was &amp;gt; 95% free from contaminating proteins) compared with nBet v 1 (75 to 80%). The rBet v 1, nBet v 1 and birch pollen extract exhibited equivalent (immunoblot) reactivity against IgE obtained from patients with birch pollen allergy (pooled sera) and Bet v 1-specific murine mAbs, indicating the correct, natural folding of the recombinant protein. An analysis using circular dichroism indicated that rBet v 1 and nBet v 1 contained similar alpha-helical secondary structures, but rBet v 1 had a greater beta-strand secondary structure content compared with nBet v 1. In an investigation of protein thermodynamics, rBet v 1 was demonstrated to be folded in a configuration that was similar, but more compact and stable, compared with nBet v 1. The rBet v 1 and nBet v 1 proteins induced equivalent activation of basophils (determined by histamine release from granulocytes obtained from patients with birch pollen allergy) and proliferation of rBet v 1-specific T-cell lines (generated from rBet v 1-stimulated PBMCs obtained from patients with birch pollen allergy) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="653290"&gt;653290&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Batches of an rBet v 1.0101 protein isoform produced in accordance with GMP were characterized using physiochemical and ELISA methods under the aegis of the Biological Standardization Program of the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp;amp; Healthcare (EDQM) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043571"&gt;1043571&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043573"&gt;1043573&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043679"&gt;1043679&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043687"&gt;1043687&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The quality of multiple rBet v 1.0101 protein batches was consistent (ie, in appearance, clarity, color, purity, rBet v 1 protein content, pH, DNA content, host cell protein content and endotoxin content). Mass spectrometry-based analyses indicated that rBet v 1.0101 was 159 amino acids long and had 96.2% sequence identity, and a theoretical average molecular weight (17,439.6 Da) that coincided with a major Bet v 1a pollen allergen entry in the Swiss-Prot protein sequence database (primary accession number: P15494) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043571"&gt;1043571&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043573"&gt;1043573&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043679"&gt;1043679&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043687"&gt;1043687&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Characterization using orthogonal separation techniques demonstrated that the rBet v 1.0101 protein was &amp;gt; 99.9% homogeneous. In a dynamic light scattering analysis, the rBet v 1.0101 protein contained monomeric molecules that were stable in tests performed up to 3 months after storage at 4degC. An analysis using circular dichroism indicated that the alpha-helical and beta-strand secondary structures of rBet v 1.0101 were typical of other clinical-grade rBet v 1 preparations (see the reference for details [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="653290"&gt;653290&lt;/ulink&gt;]). The rBet v 1.0101 protein exhibited allergenic potency (ie, contained relevant IgG epitopes and dose-dependently activated basophils) that was equivalent to an nBet v 1 protein in functional assays. This characterization demonstrates that GMP-grade rBet v 1.0101 was highly similar to nBet v 1 and it was selected by the EDQM as an international reference material for product characterization and stability studies required for the clinical application of allergenic drug candidates, such as Oralair Birch [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043573"&gt;1043573&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Hexylamine (HEA), phenylpropylamine (PPA) and 4-mercapto-ethyl-pyridine (MEP) mixed-mode chromatographic (HyperCel) sorbents were investigated to optimize the purification of rBet v 1 protein during manufacturing [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043575"&gt;1043575&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Analyses established that rBet v 1 could be captured under physiological-like conditions (ie, low conductivity and neutral pH) from crude rBet v 1-expressing E coli lysate (100 microl in a 96-well plate format at 3 mg/ml total protein content) with HEA and PPA sorbents, but only partially with the MEP sorbent. An investigation of desorption of rBet v 1 from HEA and PPA sorbents by charge repulsion during increasing acidity with sodium acetate buffer (50 mM at pH 5, 4.5, 4 and 3) demonstrated that desorption was optimal at pH 4 and pH 4 to 3, respectively. The capture of rBet v 1 was further investigated with prepacked resolute chromatography columns (HyperCel) containing MEP, HEA, and PPA sorbents; rBet v 1 was captured with HEA and PPA prepacked columns, but only partially with the MEP prepacked column, confirming previous results. The rBet v 1 was recovered from HEA and PPA prepacked columns with sodium acetate buffer (50 mM) and homogeneity was estimated with size-exclusion chromatography; rBet v 1 recovered from HEA prepacked columns was 85.2 (pH 5) and 58.7% (pH 4.5) homogeneous, and from PPA prepacked columns was 85.7% (pH 4) homogeneous, compared with 9.3% homogeneity for the rBet v 1-expressing E coli lysate. Total rBet v 1 protein recovered from HEA prepacked columns was 78.3% compared with 74.1% from PPA prepacked columns. An rBet v 1-contaminating protein, which retained an N-terminal translation initiator methionine residue (Met-rBet v 1) was not retained by HEA and PPA prepacked columns at the same pH as rBet v 1; Met-rBet v 1 was recovered from HEA and PPA prepacked columns with sodium acetate buffer (50 mM) at pH 4 to 3 and 3 compared with pH 5 to 4.5 and 4 for rBet v 1, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043575"&gt;1043575&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;There were no available toxicity data for Oralair Birch or rBet v 1 variants at the time of publication.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism and pharmacokinetics&lt;/subtitle&gt;At the time of publication, there were no available metabolism and pharmacokinetics data for Oralair Birch; however, there were metabolism and pharmacokinetics data available for SLIT with other major allergens. For example, a 123I-labeled allergen from Parietaria judaica (Par j 1) was not detected systemically until the allergen was swallowed, when it was rapidly degraded and absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Most of the tracer was lost from the oral cavity after 2 h, but 2% of local radioactivity remained associated with the oral mucosa for up to 20 h after administration, even after rinsing the mouth [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079317"&gt;1079317&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079319"&gt;1079319&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical development&lt;/subtitle&gt;Prior to the development of the SLIT Oralair Birch, clinical trials with the recombinant molecule were conducted using an SPT (allergen placed on the forearm prior to a skin prick) to demonstrate immunogenicity and using a subcutaneous route of administration.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Skin prick test&lt;/subtitle&gt;A clinical trial assessed rBet v 1 and rBet v 2 (30 microl of 3 or 10 microg/ml rBet) allergens in patients (n = 58) with rhinitis or respiratory complaints who had a positive SPT in response to a licensed birch pollen extract (Alustal) or to a mixed birch pollen extract (25% each of alder, birch, hornbeam and hazelnut pollen). Healthy control volunteers (n = 7) had no prior clinical history of allergy, and atopic control volunteers (n = 8) were monosensitized to either cat or mite allergens [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079301"&gt;1079301&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients in the birch-sensitized cohort had a positive SPT reaction to rBet v 1 (92%), rBet v 2 (19.6%) or to both allergens (13.7%). In the patients who reacted to the 3- or 10-microg/ml rBet v 1 dose, a significant correlation was observed between the wheal diameters induced after an SPT with licensed birch pollen extract and with rBet v 1 (p &amp;lt; 0.05 for both doses). Significant correlation was also noted between the erythema induced after an SPT with birch pollen extract and with the 3-microg/ml rBet v 1 dose (p = 0.01). Using immunoblotting, IgE antibodies against rBet v 1 or 2 were detected in the serum of 83 and 60% patients who had an rBet v 1- or 2-positive skin reaction, respectively. Healthy control volunteers did not react to rBet v 1 or 2 and serum IgE antibodies against rBet v 1 or 2 were undetectable. Patients (n = 37) with birch-sensitized rhinitis reacted to rBet v 1 and those who were monosensitized to birch did not react to rBet v 2; a reaction to rBet v 2 was associated with a reaction to other pollens, such as grass [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079301"&gt;1079301&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A clinical trial assessed rBet v 1, nBet v 1 and birch pollen extract in patients (n = 25) with birch pollen allergy; a control group (n = 5) were non-allergic to birch pollen [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085194"&gt;1085194&lt;/ulink&gt;]. After SPT with the allergens in evaluable birch pollen-allergic patients, the level of serum IgE antibodies, basophil activation (histamine release and basophil activation marker CD203c expression by allergen-stimulated PBMC in vitro) and skin responses were associated, but the magnitude of the each response was not well correlated. The lack of correlation was not explained by the levels of serum IgG or IgA antibodies against nBet v 1, or by IFNgamma or IL-10 production by allergen-stimulated PBMCs in vitro; in fact, allergen-stimulated PBMCs from birch pollen-allergic patients secreted more IL-10 than allergen-stimulated PBMCs from the non-allergic control group. Allergen-stimulated PBMCs from patients with birch pollen allergy also secreted more IL-5 than allergen-stimulated PBMCs from the non-allergic control group [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1085194"&gt;1085194&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Subcutaneous immunotherapy&lt;/subtitle&gt;A phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group-assignment, multicenter clinical trial (&lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="23833"&gt;NCT00410930&lt;/ulink&gt;; DV08.01) assessed rBet v 1, nBet v 1 and a licensed birch pollen extract (Alustal) (0 to 15 microg of each allergen, SCIT administered weekly for 12 weeks, then 15 microg SCIT administered monthly for 2 years) in patients (n = 147) with a &gt;/= 2-year history of birch pollen-related rhinoconjunctivitis, a positive SPT response (wheal &amp;gt; 3 mm diameter) to Bet v 1 and/or mild asthma (global initiative for asthma grade 1 to 2) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043570"&gt;1043570&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043592"&gt;1043592&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043690"&gt;1043690&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Each Bet v 1 allergen was prepared as an aluminum hydroxide-absorbed vaccine; the placebo group was administered with histamine dihydrochloride to cause skin irritation for the purpose of blinding. Treatment with all three allergens significantly reduced the occurrence of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (p = 0.0002, 0.0024 and 0.0006 for rBet v 1, birch pollen extract and nBet v 1, respectively), skin sensitivity (p &amp;lt; 0.0001 for all three forms) and the use of rescue and controller medications (p = 0.0011, 0.0063 and 0.0025 for rBet v 1, birch pollen extract and nBet v 1, respectively) compared with the placebo group. Furthermore, after 1 to 2 years of treatment, the levels of Bet v 1-specific IgG and IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4) were increased in all treated groups compared with placebo. In contrast, after 1 to 2 years of treatment, no changes in Bet v 1-specific IgE, IgA or IgG3 were observed [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043690"&gt;1043690&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Sublingual immunotherapy&lt;/subtitle&gt;At the time of publication, two phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group-assignment, single-center clinical trials to assess single-ascending-dose and multiple-dose Oralair Birch in patients with birch pollen-induced allergic rhinitis for &gt;/= 2 years were listed on the NIH clinical trials registry.

Two patients in each of the three treatment groups experienced a treatment-unrelated serious adverse event; the events were appendicitis, endometriosis, hemorrhoids, hysterectomy, stroke and headache. A treatment-related serious adverse event, systemic anaphylactic reaction (urticaria with drop in blood pressure), was experienced by one patient in the nBet v 1-treatment group that required dose reduction, but did not cause the patient to discontinue the trial. Local reactions that occurred immediately after treatment, such as itching, pain, warmth or swelling, were reported equally by all groups. In contrast, local reactions that occurred later were most often reported by the treated groups. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events reported (&gt;/= 10%) included rhinitis (n = 13, 12, 16 and 20 in the placebo, nBet v 1, rBet v 1 and birch pollen groups, respectively), sneezing (n = 4, 1, 4 and 4, respectively), coughing (n = 1, 0, 1 and 5, respectively), conjunctivitis (n = 7, 12, 6 and 17, respectively), eye pruritis (n = 14, 2, 4 and 4, respectively) and local reactions (n = 7, 10, 48 and 15, respectively). A local reaction that was caused by histamine was reported by seven patients in the placebo group [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043690"&gt;1043690&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the two phase I clinical trials assessing SLIT Oralair Birch in patients with birch pollen-related allergic rhinitis, data from evaluable patients demonstrated that Oralair Birch was well tolerated up to doses of 50 microg independent of dose titration [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1016643"&gt;1016643&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043685"&gt;1043685&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In contrast, incremental doses of &amp;gt; 100 microg or single doses of 150 microg were not well tolerated. In total, 402 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported. Of the patients (n = 84) who received Oralair Birch, 81% reported TEAEs that were SLIT-related. Of the reported TEAEs, 59% were mild and 3% were severe. In total, 16 patients withdrew from the trial. Of the patients receiving Oralair Birch, 10 withdrew from the trial because of TEAEs; the patients who withdrew had received the 50- (n = 3), 150- (n = 5), 200- (n = 1) or 300-microg (n = 1) doses of Oralair Birch [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1016643"&gt;1016643&lt;/ulink&gt;]. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported. The adverse events reported occurred within a short time scale at the site of tablet administration and resolved quickly. Commonly reported TEAEs and adverse events were rhinitis, throat irritation, pharyngeal edema, ear pruritis, oral mucosal blistering, swollen tongue, oropharyngeal pruritis and oral hypoesthesia [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1016643"&gt;1016643&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1043685"&gt;1043685&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the phase IIb/III clinical trial in patients with symptomatic birch pollen-related allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, Oralair Birch was well tolerated, particularly in the 12.5- and 25-microg dose groups [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1042410"&gt;1042410&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Patent summary&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes&lt;/ulink&gt;' European patent &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="IN1554997"&gt;EP-00278877&lt;/ulink&gt; claims a grass pollen allergen that presumably covers &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes&lt;/ulink&gt;' Oralair Grasses product. However, the claims in &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="IN1554997"&gt;EP-00278877&lt;/ulink&gt; are general and do not specify an allergen, so it may have relevance to Oralair Birch. Although the patent expired in January 2008, a supplementary protection certificate was granted in 2009 in France, and is due to expire in January 2013. This protection was presumably sought in response to the European launch of a grass allergen SLIT tablet product (&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="42238"&gt;Grazax&lt;/ulink&gt;) in 2006 and 2007.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Additional protection for Oralair Birch may be conferred from &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1022510"&gt;Biomay AG&lt;/ulink&gt;'s Bet v 1 patent portfolio, which &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes&lt;/ulink&gt; licensed in May 2003 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="652916"&gt;652916&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1022510"&gt;Biomay&lt;/ulink&gt;'s Bet v 1 patent portfolio includes: &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3753277"&gt;WO-2009024208&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3573916"&gt;WO-2007134350&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="IN2710181"&gt;WO-09410194&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="IN1509016"&gt;WO-09202621&lt;/ulink&gt;. &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3753277"&gt;WO-2009024208&lt;/ulink&gt; claims specific mutant hypoallergenic forms of Bet v 1a for use in vaccines. &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3573916"&gt;WO-2007134350&lt;/ulink&gt; claims the use of an antibody for passive immunization for the prevention and/or treatment of allergic reactions caused by an exposure to a birch pollen allergen, where the antibody binds to a Bet v 1 fragment, as well as a vaccine comprising the antibody. &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="IN2710181"&gt;WO-09410194&lt;/ulink&gt; claims recombinant forms of major allergens of certain tree species, including Bet v 1, and their uses for diagnosing tree pollen allergy and/or provoking tolerance to the allergen. &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="IN1509016"&gt;WO-09202621&lt;/ulink&gt; claims recombinant DNA molecules coding for allergens, including Bet v 1, as well as the allergens. Other applications from &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="1022510"&gt;Biomay&lt;/ulink&gt; that may have some relevance to Oralair Birch include: (i) &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA2877187"&gt;WO-03089009&lt;/ulink&gt; claiming microparticles comprising a bead essentially consisting of a cross-linked carbohydrate (eg, aragose) and an allergen, in which Bet v 1a is briefly mentioned (however Timothy grass pollen is specifically claimed); (ii) &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA2935260"&gt;WO-2005000274&lt;/ulink&gt; claiming novel microspheres containing unspecified allergens, or DNA encoding allergens, characterized by high affinity to intestinal or nasal epithelial cells and their use for treating allergies; and (iii) &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3579634"&gt;WO-2007140505&lt;/ulink&gt; claiming novel vaccine carrier fusion proteins.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Similarly, &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes&lt;/ulink&gt; has made additional applications with some relevance to Oralair Birch, including: (i) &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA192382"&gt;WO-00192546&lt;/ulink&gt; claiming a method for producing recombinant allergens in plant cells; (ii) &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3350188"&gt;WO-2006123230&lt;/ulink&gt; claiming immunogenic compositions comprising an allergen, including Bet v 1, and a bacterium-derived adjuvant and/or a corticosteroid plus a vitamin D3-based adjuvant; (iii) &lt;ulink linkType="Patent" linkID="PA3608028"&gt;WO-2008023233&lt;/ulink&gt; claiming a synthetic particulate vector carrying an allergen, including Bet v1, for preventing or treating allergy, autoimmune disease or graft rejection; and (iv) claiming a mucoadhesive composition of chitosan particles loaded with an allergen, including Bet v 1.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Oralair Birch, a SLIT tablet containing the major birch pollen allergen rBet v 1a, in development by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes&lt;/ulink&gt;, appears to be a promising treatment option for allergic rhinitis in patients with birch pollen allergy. Allergen-specific IT provides a long-term solution for the treatment of allergic diseases as an alternative to traditional medical treatment that only controls allergic symptoms and inflammation. IT is a preferred treatment modality for patients with prolonged allergic disease because a complete, 3-year IT course has the potential to reduce allergic symptoms and the use of rescue and controller medication for years after treatment termination.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;IT is mainly administered as SCIT and SLIT, with SLIT having a better safety profile. SLIT in liquid drops is mostly administered by means of droppers or in monodose vials [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079175"&gt;1079175&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The patients are instructed to maintain the liquid below the tongue for at least 2 min, which makes compliance with this method difficult, especially in children. Sublingual tablets can be held under the tongue more easily and also ensure accurate dosing. Moreover, the local concentration of the allergen will probably be greater with a rapidly dissolving tablet than with liquid drops, which could improve allergen uptake by dendritic cells in the oral submucosa.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Oralair Birch is a recombinant allergenic protein and not a natural allergen extract. The advantages of a recombinant allergenic protein over a natural allergen extract are multifold and include the ability to mass-produce a vaccine to GMP standards with a high level of purity and homology. These advantages likely mean that a recombinant major allergen may be used to treat allergic patients with a smaller risk of causing the development of new allergic sensitizations than a natural allergen extract.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;These theoretical advantages of Oralair Birch over natural pollen extracts are reflected clinically in the positive results from the phase IIb/III clinical trial, which demonstrated an improvement in the average adjusted symptom score of 25% over the whole birch pollen season compared with placebo. This compares well with the results presented from two clinical trials with SLIT grass allergen tablets; the average rhinoconjunctivitis scores reported by patients in active treatment groups demonstrated reduced rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (16 to 27%) and reduced use of rescue and controller medication (28 to 46%) during the grass pollen season compared with placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079274"&gt;1079274&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079276"&gt;1079276&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The improvements in the Oralair Birch trial were slightly lower than those reported from a recombinant grass pollen SCIT clinical trial; the combined symptom-medication score was reduced by 39% compared with placebo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="996067"&gt;996067&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Birch pollen allergy is the most important tree allergy in Europe and, although the birch pollen season is short, the peak pollen count is usually high, which causes severe symptomatic allergic rhinitis and seasonal asthma. Worldwide, birch pollen allergy is probably among the most common allergies. Allergenic cross-reactivity between members of the alder tree family is high and cross-reactivity also occurs with certain food allergens (eg, hazelnut, apple and apricot). Therefore, the target population for Oralair Birch is extensive and could expand should the indications for Oralair Birch become broader in the future. If Oralair Birch is approved, it will probably be easier to gain approval for other recombinant allergen SLIT tablets such as &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes&lt;/ulink&gt;' &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="55054"&gt;Oralair Mites&lt;/ulink&gt;, a phase III recombinant vaccine in sublingual tablet formulation that targets three mite allergens for the treatment of dust mite allergy [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1004234"&gt;1004234&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A final indicator of the market potential of Oralair Birch is that &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes&lt;/ulink&gt; has demonstrated continued growth since 2000 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="994434"&gt;994434&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1082700"&gt;1082700&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes&lt;/ulink&gt; is a company with a proactive attitude that has earned credibility in the allergy community. &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes&lt;/ulink&gt; has expanded its market over the last couple of years, first in southern Europe and it now has commercial partners and distributors in various parts of the world. Moreover, the Stalair program for development and marketing of a range of sublingual tablets makes its future route clear: to meet the needs of allergic individuals worldwide [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="994425"&gt;994425&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes&lt;/ulink&gt; has established a partnership with Paladin for marketing and distribution in Canada and is openly looking for new partners in other territories [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="994434"&gt;994434&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At the time of publication, there was only a press release disclosing the positive results from the phase IIb/III double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of Oralair Birch. The global design of the trial and the number of patients enrolled appears adequate enough to demonstrate the primary efficacy endpoint for analysis of the results of the reduction in average adjusted symptom score, and the data disclosed do support a positive outcome. Analysis of these data should make it possible to select the optimum dose and to define the conditions for a confirmatory phase III trial that will be conducted with a view to filing a centralized MAA with the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="22824"&gt;EMEA&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1042410"&gt;1042410&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn until an in-depth analysis of the trial has been published.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In the EU, the regulation on the registration of IT products has become progressively more stringent [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1088623"&gt;1088623&lt;/ulink&gt;]. As a consequence, registration and commercialization of new IT products has become a long and slow process. Reports from &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19274"&gt;Stallergenes&lt;/ulink&gt; in 2003 mentioned 2007 as a target year for the registration of Oralair Birch [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="652931"&gt;652931&lt;/ulink&gt;], but, at the time of publication, phase III trials had yet to be initiated. However, the registration of the Oralair Grasses tablet was rapid once positive phase III trial results had been published [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="994434"&gt;994434&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1079276"&gt;1079276&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A potential to reengineer a recombinant protein vaccine, such as Oralair Birch, to improve the efficacy-safety balance has yet to be exploited. Indeed, there is potential to make an hypoallergenic variant of Oralair Birch or to combine Oralair Birch with immunomodulatory substances.
