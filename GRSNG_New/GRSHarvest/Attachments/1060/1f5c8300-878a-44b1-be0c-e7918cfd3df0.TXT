The primary endpoint would be the incidence of adverse events and the number of patients with treatment emergent adverse events. At that time, the trial was expected to complete in November 2033. In July 2018, the study was recruiting  patients and expected to complete in November 2034 [&lt;ulink linkID="1907674" linkType="Reference"&gt;1907674&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2009, it was planned that a phase I/II trial would be conducted in France [&lt;ulink linkID="1058646" linkType="Reference"&gt;1058646&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2010, the phase I/II trial was expected to start in the first quarter of 2011 with results anticipated in 2012. At that time, the company planned to submit an IND for a US trial in the second quarter of 2011  [&lt;ulink linkID="1125846" linkType="Reference"&gt;1125846&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2010, a CTA dossier was submitted to the AFSSAPS. In February 2011, an IND dossier was submitted to the FDA and feedback was expected by the end of the first quarter of 2011. At that time, the phase I/IIa trial was expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1172401" linkType="Reference"&gt;1172401&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2011, the FDA approved an IND for an open-label, dose-escalation, phase I/IIa trial of the drug. The study would enroll up to 28 patients  in the US and France  and would assess three dose levels for safety, tolerability and biological activity. At that time, the trial was expected to begin in the second quarter of 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1177786" linkType="Reference"&gt;1177786&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2011, the trial (&lt;ulink linkID="77977" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01367444&lt;/ulink&gt;; SG1/001/10) was initiated and was expected to be complete by October 2013 [&lt;ulink linkID="1199980" linkType="Reference"&gt;1199980&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2012, a data safety monitoring board issued a positive interim review. In July 2012, a second site was opened in France. In March 2012, data were expected in the second half of 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1268895" linkType="Reference"&gt;1268895&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2012, data were presented at the 2012 ARVO annual meeting in Fort Lauderdale, FL.  Following vitrectomy in patients, lentiviral vectors (equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV)-ABCA4 for Stargardt) were administered subretinally. In cohort-1, patients had been treated for Stargardt disease and cohort-2 was underway. No toxicity was observed in patients treated in cohort-1. Subretinal fluid reabsorption was found to be rapid and complete, without inflammatory consequence. Dosing was well tolerated for up to 11 months post surgery. At that time, monitoring of endpoints  was ongoing. The Stargardt disease trial was underway following FDA and AFSSAPS approval [&lt;ulink linkID="1280717" linkType="Reference"&gt;1280717&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2012, the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) approved continuation of the study to the third patient cohort, after a review of data from first eight patients showed no serious adverse events had occurred. At that time, further data were expected in the fourth quarter of 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1313890" linkType="Reference"&gt;1313890&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in November 2012, the third patient (n = 4) cohort was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1342318" linkType="Reference"&gt;1342318&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2013, positive DSMB review on the first three patient cohorts (n = 12) was received [&lt;ulink linkID="1422100" linkType="Reference"&gt;1422100&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2013,  data were presented at the 2013 ASGCT Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City, UT. StarGen demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability [&lt;ulink linkID="1420651" linkType="Reference"&gt;1420651&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in June 2013, recruitment was voluntarily paused due to the detection of very low concentrations of potential impurities derived from a widely-used third party raw material. At that time, the trial was expected to resume "as soon as possible" [&lt;ulink linkID="1432468" linkType="Reference"&gt;1432468&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2013, Oxford BioMedica received an agreement from the US FDA and the ANSM, to resume recruitment into the trial, following the submission of a comprehensive data package. At that time, the company was working towards obtaining ethics committee approvals, to resume recruitment [&lt;ulink linkID="1488752" linkType="Reference"&gt;1488752&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2014, further data were presented at the 17th Annual Meeting of the ASGCT in Washington DC. Antibody response to RetinoStat in the blood or aqueous chamber fluid and vector components were not detected [&lt;ulink linkID="1558965" linkType="Reference"&gt;1558965&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2015, further clinical data in 16 patients were presented at the 2015 ARVO Meeting in Denver, CO. Immune response to a capsid protein was observed in two patients. StarGen treatment was safe and well tolerated, with no ocular inflammation and biological activity in any patient [&lt;ulink linkID="1650803" linkType="Reference"&gt;1650803&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2017, the trial was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1199980" linkType="Reference"&gt;1199980&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1907559" linkType="Reference"&gt;1907559&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2017, further year-one results from 22 patients were presented at the 2017 ARVO Meeting in Baltimore, MD. At week 48, for cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, mean change in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters from baseline was + 7, -1, + 3, + 7, and + 2, respectively, in the study eyes and + 5, -2, + 3, + 3, and + 2, respectively, for the untreated eyes. For cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, mean change in Hill of Vision total volume was 5.9, 2.4, 5.0, -8.3, and -0.9, respectively, for the study eyes and + 9.7, + 3.4, + 4.5, - 3.6, and + 5.2, respectively, for the untreated eyes. A total of 125 treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) and 2 serious AEs (intraocular inflammation and elevated intraocular pressure) were reported by all 22 patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1925427" linkType="Reference"&gt;1925427&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2009, it was planned that a phase I/II trial would be conducted in France [&lt;ulink linkID="1058646" linkType="Reference"&gt;1058646&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2010, the company planned to submit a CTA by the end of that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1143078" linkType="Reference"&gt;1143078&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2010, the CTA  dossier was submitted to the AFSSAPS. At that time,  RAC protocol was also submitted and AFFSAPS decision was pending by the end of the first quarter of  2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1172401" linkType="Reference"&gt;1172401&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2017, preclinical data were presented at the 2017 ARVO Meeting in Baltimore, MD.

SAR-422459 showed no adverse clinical findings and did not affect body weight and food consumption [&lt;ulink linkID="1925504" linkType="Reference"&gt;1925504&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2012, data on EIAV-based LentiVector products were presented at the 15th Annual Meeting of the ASGCT in Philadelphia, PA. Biodistribution studies in rabbits and nonhuman primates showed that the EIAV-based products, including StarGen, remained in the ocular compartment and as a result, there were little or no antibody responses. This therapy was found to be safe, and resulted in stable and long-term therapeutic expression  [&lt;ulink linkID="1292202" linkType="Reference"&gt;1292202&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2013, similar data were presented at the 2013 ASGCT Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City, UT [&lt;ulink linkID="1420651" linkType="Reference"&gt;1420651&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2011, preclinical data were presented at the 2011 ARVO Annual Meeting in Fort Lauderdale, FL. In Abca4-/- mice, subretinal administration of StarGen stimulated human ABCA4 protein production.  Toxic lipofuscin (A2E and iso-A2E) accumulation was decreased in  mouse eyes over 6 months.

Submacular injections of StarGen into the left eyes of rhesus macaques elicited expression in retinal pigment epithelial cells and outer segments of both cone and rod photoreceptors of the retina. Mild transient ocular inflammation was observed [&lt;ulink linkID="1001694" linkType="Reference"&gt;1001694&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By March 2008, preclinical proof-of-concept had been demonstrated [&lt;ulink linkID="884252" linkType="Reference"&gt;884252&lt;/ulink&gt;].
