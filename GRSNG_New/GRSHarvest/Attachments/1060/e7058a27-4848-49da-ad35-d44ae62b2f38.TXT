The issued composition of matter patents would expire from 2021 to 2027 (excluding possible patent term extensions). Pending applications were expected to expire from 2021 to 2022 (excluding possible patent term extensions). Additionally, the company specified that it had patent applications directed to compositions of matter for CALD gene therapy vectors and compositions and methods of using the vectors and compositions in cell-based gene therapy of ALD or adrenomyeloneuropathy, including two issued US patents and  four issued foreign patents which would expire in 2032; the company also had one pending US patent application and 10 pending corresponding foreign applications which, if granted, would expire  in 2032 (excluding possible patent term extensions). Also at that time, the company noted that in-licensed patents from INSERM related to the ABCD1 gene and corresponding protein, for use in the field of human ALD therapy, had expired in February 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1911086" linkType="Reference"&gt;1911086&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2019, bluebird bio noted that it's patent portfolio included three US patents and five pending corresponding foreign applications, and 26 issued foreign patents; at that time, the issued composition of matter patents for CALD gene therapy vectors were slated to expire in 2032 (excluding possible patent-term extensions).

In June 2012, Orphan Drug designation was granted for ALD [&lt;ulink linkID="1302305" linkType="Reference"&gt;1302305&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;PREMARKETING STUIDES&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;In November 2018, a multi-site phase III trial (ALD-104) was planned  to initiate in early 2019, for the treatment of patients with CALD to enable access following completion of enrollment in the Starbeam study, and to evaluate the suitability of additional conditioning regimens for use with the Lenti-D [&lt;ulink linkID="2089597" linkType="Reference"&gt;2089597&lt;/ulink&gt;].	In January 2019, an international, non-randomized, open-label, multi-site phase III study (NCT03852498;ALD-104)  was initiated in the US, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells, transduced ex-vivo with Lenti-D lentiviral vector, using Busulfan and Fludarabine in patients (expected n = 20) ≤17 years of age with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD). The primary endpoint  was to measure the proportion of patients who are alive and do not have any of the 6 major functional disabilities (MFDs)  at 24 months. In March 2019, the trial was expected to complete in February 2023 [&lt;ulink linkID="2148215" linkType="Reference"&gt;2148215&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2019, the first patient was treated [&lt;ulink linkID="2147829" linkType="Reference"&gt;2147829&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2010, larger clinical studies were planned to begin in Europe and the US in 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1102291" linkType="Reference"&gt;1102291&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2012  , the pivotal phase III trial was being planned for the US, UK and France [&lt;ulink linkID="1260911" linkType="Reference"&gt;1260911&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2013, an open-label, single-dose, non-randomized, single-group, safety/efficacy, phase II/III trial (&lt;ulink linkID="145616" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01896102&lt;/ulink&gt;; ALD-102) was initiated  in patients (n = 15) with CCALD aged &amp;lt;/= 17 years in the US, France and the UK. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who were alive with no Major Functional Disabilities (MFDs) as determined by key measures in the Neurological Function Score (NFS) and the  proportion of subjects who experience either acute or chronic GVHD at month 24. At that time, the trial was expected to complete in August 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="1459630" linkType="Reference"&gt;1459630&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in October 2013, the first patient was transplanted in the Starbeam trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1499867" linkType="Reference"&gt;1499867&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2013, the trial (2011-001953-10; ALD-102) began in the UK and France and after the completion of the study, the patients were to be followed for long term safety and efficacy (LTF-303; 2013-002245-11; &lt;ulink linkID="248845" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02633943&lt;/ulink&gt;) for 13 years [&lt;ulink linkID="1626883" linkType="Reference"&gt;1626883&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2060552" linkType="Reference"&gt;2060552&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By May 2015, 18 patients had been enrolled [&lt;ulink linkID="1657466" linkType="Reference"&gt;1657466&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2015, clinical data were presented from four patients at the 13th ISSCR Annual Meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. There was no evidence of clonal dominance or skewing based on the retrieval of lentiviral insertion repertoire in different hematopoietic lineages by deep sequencing [&lt;ulink linkID="1673524" linkType="Reference"&gt;1673524&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2016, a multi-center, long-term safety and efficacy follow-up study (&lt;ulink linkID="254873" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02698579&lt;/ulink&gt;; LTF-304; &lt;ulink linkID="254873" linkType="Protocol"&gt;2015-002805-13&lt;/ulink&gt;) for a total of 15 years post-drug product infusion of patients (expected n = 25) with CALD who were treated in ALD-102 was initiated. At that time, the study was expected to complete in November 2033 [&lt;ulink linkID="2060557" linkType="Reference"&gt;2060557&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2060566" linkType="Reference"&gt;2060566&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="2060060" linkType="Reference"&gt;2060060&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2016, positive interim data were presented at the 68th AAN Annual Meeting in Vancouver, Canada. All patients were free of MFD and 16 of the 17 treated patients (94%) had stabilized NFS. When neuroimaging studies were analyzed, T2 hyperdense lesions were found to be stabilized and not progressed in one and two years in the treated patients. Gadolinium enhancement was resolved in 16 of the 17 patients by 16 months. ALDP was increased up to 12 months after receiving the therapy. The study procedure was well tolerated with no graft failure or GvHD [&lt;ulink linkID="1754152" linkType="Reference"&gt;1754152&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1753776" linkType="Reference"&gt;1753776&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1753813" linkType="Reference"&gt;1753813&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2016, further clinical data were presented at the 19th Annual ASGCT Meeting in Washington DC. Polyclonal reconstitution was observed in all subjects, with no indication of vector mediated clonal skewing. Median change in Loes Score was observed to be 1, and no patient demonstrated progression of neurological function score. BK virus cystitis and tachycardia were the two adverse events assessed as possibly related to elivaldogene tavalentivec drug production [&lt;ulink linkID="1757913" linkType="Reference"&gt;1757913&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2016, the company was planning to expand enrollment by up to eight additional patients in the US and Europe in an effort to enable the first manufacture of elivaldogene tavalentivec in Europe [&lt;ulink linkID="1902783" linkType="Reference"&gt;1902783&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2017, bluebird bio planned to start dosing the additional subjects in Europe in early 2017 and a separate long-term follow up protocol to evaluate safety for up to 15 years was planned to monitor efficacy endpoints to demonstrate a sustained treatment effect [&lt;ulink linkID="1911086" linkType="Reference"&gt;1911086&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2017, positive topline interim data were reported from  the initial cohort of 17 patients who had completed   2 years of follow-up post-elivaldogene tavalentivec treatment showing that 15/17 (88%) remained free of MFDs; at that time, enrollment of the eight additional patients was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="1941116" linkType="Reference"&gt;1941116&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2017, similar data were published [&lt;ulink linkID="1967985" linkType="Reference"&gt;1967985&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1968253" linkType="Reference"&gt;1968253&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In September 2018, updated   results  were presented at the  2018 SSIEM Annual Symposium in Athens, Greece; at the data cutoff of April 25, 2018,  the study completed enrollment with a total study population of  31 patients.  The additional patients had not reached the 24-month follow-up; however, no MFDs had been reported. The median follow-up for the additional cohort was 4.2 months  [&lt;ulink linkID="2069834" linkType="Reference"&gt;2069834&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were presented at the same conference. Replication competent lentivirus or insertional oncogenesis was not observed. Graft failure, GVHD, or transplant-related mortality was not reported. Most of the adverse events reported were consistent with myeloablative conditioning [&lt;ulink linkID="2068462" linkType="Reference"&gt;2068462&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In 2006, a clinical trial, presumably a phase I/II trial, was initiated in France  recruiting five patients. In November 2009, clinical data were presented at the 17th Annual European Society of Gene &amp;amp; Cell Congress in Hanover, Germany. Three patients had been treated, two over 30 months ago and one over 16 months ago, and the procedure had been well tolerated with no genotoxic effects observed. Repopulation of cells had been successful and polyclonal. Copy number had been stable (approximately 0.2 vector copies/cell). In peripheral blood samples, expression of the recombinant transgene was excellent.  Neurological outcomes data looked positive. At that time, Genetix planned to expand the trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1061853" linkType="Reference"&gt;1061853&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1062951" linkType="Reference"&gt;1062951&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data reporting that disease was stabilized and the therapy was safe and efficacious were also reported in November 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="1055314" linkType="Reference"&gt;1055314&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2010, further data were presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy's 13th Annual Meeting in Washington DC. Two patients had stable disease and continued expression of CCALD protein at three years and a third showed stable expression of CCALD protein at 20 months [&lt;ulink linkID="1102291" linkType="Reference"&gt;1102291&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2011, further clinical data on HIV-1 lentiviral self-inactivating (SIN)-vector was presented at the 14th Annual Meeting of the ASGCT in Seattle, WA.In all the three patients, the insertion of lentiviral vector in the same genes or genomic regions as common integration sites was observed   [&lt;ulink linkID="1186586" linkType="Reference"&gt;1186586&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2011, data were presented from the phase I/II trial at the 53rd ASH meeting in San Diego, CA. Data from four patients demonstrated ALD protein to be reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells following injection, with expression in monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes also reduced. There was no sign of clonal dominance or outgrowth and no genotoxicity. Of the four subjects, two were able to continue normal school and two were unable to attend [&lt;ulink linkID="1243491" linkType="Reference"&gt;1243491&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2012, similar data were presented at the 15th Annual Meeting of the ASGCT in Philadelphia, PA. Two patients treated for five years showed sustainable increased ALD enzyme levels and neurological response, and had ambulatory life. A third patient failed to respond to the treatment for unknown reasons. At this time, a fourth patient, treated for only 18 months, showed no neurological deficit and normal cognitive capacities [&lt;ulink linkID="1291279" linkType="Reference"&gt;1291279&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1292617" linkType="Reference"&gt;1292617&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By November 2004, INSERM had proposed a phase I/II trial [&lt;ulink linkID="572062" linkType="Reference"&gt;572062&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Other studies&lt;/subtitle&gt;By February 2017, a non-interventional retrospective study (ALD-101) in CALD patients was completed at the recommendation of the FDA to assess the natural course of disease in CALD patients that were left untreated in comparison to the efficacy and safety data obtained from patients that received allogeneic HSCT. Survival, functional and neuropsychological assessments and neuroimaging data from 137 patients (72 untreated and 65 treated with allogeneic HSCT) in the US and France were collected. However, due to the retrospective nature of the study, and the limited number of patients with this condition, the FDA had advised bluebird bio that the ALD-101 study was not sufficiently robust to serve as a conventional historical control group and as a basis of comparison against the results of the Starbeam study [&lt;ulink linkID="1911086" linkType="Reference"&gt;1911086&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2017, further data were presented at the 13th ICIEM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Estimated five-year overall survival was 55 and 94%; estimated two-year major functional disabilities-free survival (patients with active cerebral disease at baseline) was 29 and 84%, in untreated and all-HSCT treated patients with early disease, respectively. In patients treated with allo-HSCT, mortality rates were 8 (100 days) and 18% (one year). Incidence of infections was common (29%) and GVHD was reported by 59%, despite prophylaxis [&lt;ulink linkID="1966163" linkType="Reference"&gt;1966163&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2014, the company filed an IND amendment to conduct the observational study (ALD-103) in patients with CCALD [&lt;ulink linkID="1556547" linkType="Reference"&gt;1556547&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2014, the observational study (&lt;ulink linkID="207037" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02204904&lt;/ulink&gt;; ALD-103) began in patients (aged 17 or younger; expected n = 35) in the US, Germany, Netherlands and the UK with CALD treated by allogeneic HSCT. The primary endpoint was incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM), defined as death due to any transplantation-related cause other than disease relapse up to 48 months post-transplant. The study was to complete in May 2021 [&lt;ulink linkID="1911739" linkType="Reference"&gt;1911739&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By February 2017, the study was ongoing and the company noted that the study was designed to collect efficacy and safety outcomes data in subjects who have undergone allogeneic HSCT in a period that is contemporaneous with the Starbeam study [&lt;ulink linkID="1911086" linkType="Reference"&gt;1911086&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2018, initial  results  were presented at the  SSIEM 2018 symposium in Athens, Greece, showing  increased risks of mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT without a matched sibling donor; there were 14.6% transplant-related deaths and 12% engraftment failures reported  at one year in that group of patients.

Efficient expression of the ALDP gene was demonstrated in monocytes/macrophages derived from cultures of transduced CCALD CD34+ cells and in long term culture initiating cells. Very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) metabolism was corrected in transduced CD34+, CFU-derived and LTC-derived cells, indicating that the vector-encoded ALDP was fully functional. Transplantation of transduced CCALD CD34+ cells into NOD-SCID mice resulted in longterm expression of ALDP in monocytes/macrophages derived from engrafted stem cells [&lt;ulink linkID="572100" linkType="Reference"&gt;572100&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were presented in November 2004, at the European Society of Gene Therapy's 12th Annual Congress in Tampere, Finland. Preclinical studies indicated that CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from CCALD patients could be transduced efficiently with lentiviral vectors encoding the functional ALDP, resulting in ALDP expression in vivo in the monocyte/macrophage lineage following transplantation of the engineered cells into immunodeficient NOD-SCID mice. Phenotypic correction was reported in CCALD mice that mimic the cognate human disease. Further, it was demonstrated that CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells are able to migrate to the CNS and differentiate into microglia. Safety studies showed no evidence of replication-competent lentivirus, no vector-related adverse events even in secondary transplants, no vector silencing, and relatively high transduction efficiencies while limiting the number of vector copies/cell to less than 2 [&lt;ulink linkID="572062" linkType="Reference"&gt;572062&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Preclinical&gt;</value></Preclinical><AdditionalInformation><displayLabel>Additional Information</displayLabel><value>&lt;AdditionalInformation&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2013, the EMA's Pediatric Committee adopted a positive opinion on a pediatric investigation plan for the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="1397196" linkType="Reference"&gt;1397196&lt;/ulink&gt;].
