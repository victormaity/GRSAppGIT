The drug was indicated in the US for the treatment of CD20-positive relapsed or refractory, low-grade, follicular, or transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), including patients with &lt;ulink linkID="6736" linkType="Drug"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt;-refractory NHL lymphoma  [&lt;ulink linkID="499797" linkType="Reference"&gt;499797&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="577930" linkType="Reference"&gt;577930&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="593590" linkType="Reference"&gt;593590&lt;/ulink&gt;].  GSK discontinued manufacture in February 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1463275" linkType="Reference"&gt;1463275&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The drug was launched in  in the US in July 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="499797" linkType="Reference"&gt;499797&lt;/ulink&gt;], and in Canada in November 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="636979" linkType="Reference"&gt;636979&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However in October 2013, the FDA withdrew approval following a voluntary request from GSK after considering patient needs and clinical use [&lt;ulink linkID="1655878" linkType="Reference"&gt;1655878&lt;/ulink&gt;]; GSK discontinued manufacture in February 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1463275" linkType="Reference"&gt;1463275&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By July 2003, Amersham, the European licensee, listed the drug as being at phase III for NHL [&lt;ulink linkID="513315" linkType="Reference"&gt;513315&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, by December 2004, European rights had been returned to Corixa [&lt;ulink linkID="575877" linkType="Reference"&gt;575877&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2007, it was confirmed that the product was a North America-only asset for GSK [&lt;ulink linkID="778057" linkType="Reference"&gt;778057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The therapy was also previously in development for the treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia [&lt;ulink linkID="433431" linkType="Reference"&gt;433431&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, as of February 2005, the GSK pipeline did not list Bexxar  as being under development for any additional indications [&lt;ulink linkID="584254" linkType="Reference"&gt;584254&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A phase II trial began in multiple myeloma in August 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="1618359" linkType="Reference"&gt;1618359&lt;/ulink&gt;], however no further development was reported.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Bexxar carried a black box label warning of serious hypersensitivity reactions and prolonged and severe cytopenias [&lt;ulink linkID="593590" linkType="Reference"&gt;593590&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><PatentsAndGenerics><displayLabel>Patents and Generics</displayLabel><value>&lt;PatentsAndGenerics&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 1997, Coulter was issued US-05595721 entitled 'Radioimmunotherapy of lymphoma using anti-CD20', a method of use patent for its Bexxar therapy, and was granted Orphan Drug status for Bexxar therapy by the FDA [&lt;ulink linkID="236181" linkType="Reference"&gt;236181&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 1998, Coulter was issued with a patent covering its I-131 anti-B1 antibody and other anti-CD20 antibodies used to aid in selective tumor targeting. The patent also covers trace-radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibodies used to determine clearance rates and appropriate therapeutic dosing [&lt;ulink linkID="307904" linkType="Reference"&gt;307904&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2000, the USPTO granted SB and Coulter a composition patent relating to radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas [&lt;ulink linkID="354247" linkType="Reference"&gt;354247&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2000, Coulter and SB were issued US-06090365 by the USPTO relating to CD20 antibody therapy for the potential treatment of lymphoma [&lt;ulink linkID="376311" linkType="Reference"&gt;376311&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 1998, Coulter was negotiating with several companies in a search for a worldwide marketing partner to have a 50/50 share in the US and exclusive rights elsewhere; a deal was expected to be complete by mid-1998 [&lt;ulink linkID="280357" linkType="Reference"&gt;280357&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/PatentsAndGenerics&gt;</value></PatentsAndGenerics><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;In July 2004, Corixa filed a BLA requesting accelerated approval for expanded use of Bexxar in patients with relapsed or refractory low grade, follicular, or transformed CD20-positive NHL. The request was based on a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study of 60 chemotherapy refractory patients who had not responded to prior therapy or had responded with a duration of response of less than or equal to 6 months. 26 patients had a longer duration of response following the Bexxar treatment while five had a longer duration of response following their last chemotherapy regimen [&lt;ulink linkID="547747" linkType="Reference"&gt;547747&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2004, The FDA accepted the sBLA. At that time, Corixa expected the agency to complete its review of the sBLA by January 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="559873" linkType="Reference"&gt;559873&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The FDA approved the BLA in January 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="577930" linkType="Reference"&gt;577930&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Bexxar was initially filed with the FDA in June 1999 [&lt;ulink linkID="329969" linkType="Reference"&gt;329969&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="333654" linkType="Reference"&gt;333654&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 1999, the FDA requested modifications to be made to the existing BLA [&lt;ulink linkID="338306" linkType="Reference"&gt;338306&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="342224" linkType="Reference"&gt;342224&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="343570" linkType="Reference"&gt;343570&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="354434" linkType="Reference"&gt;354434&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2000, the companies resubmitted their BLA to the FDA and at that time, Coulter anticipated that if Bexxar received Priority Review status, it would be launched in the second quarter of 2001 [&lt;ulink linkID="382611" linkType="Reference"&gt;382611&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="383590" linkType="Reference"&gt;383590&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2000, Priority Review status was granted [&lt;ulink linkID="384968" linkType="Reference"&gt;384968&lt;/ulink&gt;], and in November 2000, the BLA was accepted [&lt;ulink linkID="389701" linkType="Reference"&gt;389701&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Bexxar was also designated a Fast Track product [&lt;ulink linkID="329969" linkType="Reference"&gt;329969&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2001, Corixa and GSK received a complete review letter from the FDA, in which the FDA outlined additional clinical and manufacturing information that Corixa must submit as a result of the review [&lt;ulink linkID="402349" linkType="Reference"&gt;402349&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="402347" linkType="Reference"&gt;402347&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2001, Corixa and GSK submitted documents, data and analyses to the FDA in support of the response [&lt;ulink linkID="418678" linkType="Reference"&gt;418678&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The remainder of the response had been submitted by September 2001 [&lt;ulink linkID="421614" linkType="Reference"&gt;421614&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="402349" linkType="Reference"&gt;402349&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="402347" linkType="Reference"&gt;402347&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="413144" linkType="Reference"&gt;413144&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2002, the FDA's Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) review of Bexxar was postponed until June 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="435291" linkType="Reference"&gt;435291&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="439764" linkType="Reference"&gt;439764&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="439763" linkType="Reference"&gt;439763&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2002, the FDA issued a complete review letter to Corixa, stating that the company's response to the agency's previous letter did not provide sufficient evidence of the safety and net clinical benefit of Bexxar and that consequently additional studies were required. Regarding Corixa's prior request for accelerated approval, the letter stated that the data reviewed by the agency do not provide sufficient evidence that Bexxar addresses an unmet medical need. At this time, Corixa planned to request a meeting with the agency, expected to occur within the next 45 days, regarding the regulatory path for Bexxar [&lt;ulink linkID="443373" linkType="Reference"&gt;443373&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="444730" linkType="Reference"&gt;444730&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By May 2002, the company had met with the FDA to discuss the way forward and, as a result, Corixa was to submit a written request to appeal the FDA's position as articulated in the March complete review letter, and was to further request a presentation of Bexxar data to the ODAC [&lt;ulink linkID="451199" linkType="Reference"&gt;451199&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the end of May 2002, Corixa duly filed a request for formal dispute resolution and petitioned for the opportunity to present data to the ODAC. If an appeal was granted, Corixa could then provide the FDA with additional data, the receipt and review of which would determine the timing of an ODAC meeting [&lt;ulink linkID="453291" linkType="Reference"&gt;453291&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2002, the FDA granted Corixa's appeal [&lt;ulink linkID="456519" linkType="Reference"&gt;456519&lt;/ulink&gt;]. As of August 2002, the FDA committee meeting had been scheduled for December 17, 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="461202" linkType="Reference"&gt;461202&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="467734" linkType="Reference"&gt;467734&lt;/ulink&gt;]. [&lt;ulink linkID="469238" linkType="Reference"&gt;469238&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In early December 2002, the FDA determined that the additional Bexxar safety data submitted in March 2002 and the response submitted in October 2002 to the agency's complete review letter from March 2002, constituted a complete response to the questions and issues raised by the FDA in its most recent complete review letter [&lt;ulink linkID="472470" linkType="Reference"&gt;472470&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the December 17, 2002 meeting, the ODAC unanimously agreed that studies of Bexxar provided substantial evidence of clinical benefit in both &lt;ulink linkID="6736" linkType="Drug"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt;-refractory patients and in chemotherapy-refractory, low-grade and follicular NHL, with or without transformation [&lt;ulink linkID="474357" linkType="Reference"&gt;474357&lt;/ulink&gt;]. To ensure accelerated approval, Corixa was planning to conduct a head-to-head study of Bexxar with &lt;ulink linkID="4705" linkType="Drug"&gt;ibritumomab tiuxetan&lt;/ulink&gt;. At that time, it was reported that Corixa expected submission of a protocol to the FDA in January 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="475343" linkType="Reference"&gt;475343&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The new PDUFA date for the FDA to complete its review of all materials regarding this product was May 2, 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="472470" linkType="Reference"&gt;472470&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="474357" linkType="Reference"&gt;474357&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2003, the FDA extended its review period of the NDA for up to an additional 3 months. The new PDUFA date for the FDA to complete its review was August 1, 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="488426" linkType="Reference"&gt;488426&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2003, it was approved in the US for the treatment of patients with CD20-positive, follicular NHL, with and without transformation, whose disease is refractory to &lt;ulink linkID="6736" linkType="Drug"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; and has relapsed following chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="495128" linkType="Reference"&gt;495128&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="577930" linkType="Reference"&gt;577930&lt;/ulink&gt;], and it was launched in the US in July 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="499797" linkType="Reference"&gt;499797&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;However in October 2013, the FDA withdrew approval following a voluntary request from GSK after considering patient needs and clinical use [&lt;ulink linkID="1655878" linkType="Reference"&gt;1655878&lt;/ulink&gt;]; GSK discontinued manufacture in February 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1463275" linkType="Reference"&gt;1463275&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;An EU submission had been expected in 3Q00, with possible approval in 2Q01 [&lt;ulink linkID="354434" linkType="Reference"&gt;354434&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No further development was reported in Europe and  in March 2007, it was confirmed that the product was a North America-only asset for GSK [&lt;ulink linkID="778057" linkType="Reference"&gt;778057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By February 2003, the drug had been granted Orphan Drug status in the EU for the treatment of follicular lymphoma [&lt;ulink linkID="479729" linkType="Reference"&gt;479729&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Rest of the world&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Canada&lt;/subtitle&gt;In August 2003, the Biologics and Genetic Therapies Directorate of Health Canada accepted Corixa's NDS for Bexxar under a Priority Review [&lt;ulink linkID="502679" linkType="Reference"&gt;502679&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2005, it was approved [&lt;ulink linkID="637137" linkType="Reference"&gt;637137&lt;/ulink&gt;], and by November 2005, it had been launched in Canada [&lt;ulink linkID="636979" linkType="Reference"&gt;636979&lt;/ulink&gt;]. GSK discontinued manufacture in February 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1463275" linkType="Reference"&gt;1463275&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Regulatory&gt;</value></Regulatory><Postmarketing><displayLabel>Postmarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Postmarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2004, Corixa and GSK presented two studies at ASCO in the first-line treatment of NHL, showing that therapy with two different standard chemotherapeutic regimens, each followed by a single treatment with Bexxar, produced compete response in 80 to 83% of patients as initial treatment for advanced, follicular B-cell NHL; based on these results, it was believed that larger trials in this setting were warranted [&lt;ulink linkID="542487" linkType="Reference"&gt;542487&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Long-term efficacy data from a phase II trial of a single one-week course of frontline treatment with  Bexxar in 76 patients with newly diagnosed advanced follicular NHL were presented at ASCO in June 2007. Patients achieved estimated 8-year and 10-year overall survival  rates of 86%. Additionally, 50% of patients survived without progression of disease at 8 years following therapy. For patients who achieved complete remission, the median time before their disease progressed was 9.2 years. An overall response rate and complete remission rate of 95% and 75%, respectively, were observed [&lt;ulink linkID="801741" linkType="Reference"&gt;801741&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Postmarketing&gt;</value></Postmarketing><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2005, clinical data  on Bexxar were presented at the 47th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA. In a phase II study of Bexxar and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in 24 adults &amp;gt;60 years with high-risk relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma, all patients underwent outpatient dosimetry using Bexxar (1.7 mg/kg) labeled with 5 to 10 mCi I[131]. The therapy was well tolerated with no treatment-related deaths, and no grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity. NCI CTC non-hematopoeitic toxicities by day 100 included 17 patients with grade 3, and 4 patients with grade 4 toxicities. At that time, 16 of 24 patients remained alive (67%) and 10 (42%) were alive and progression-free with a median follow up of 2.2 years. The estimated 3-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 56 and 37%, respectively. Surviving patients included six of nine with mantle cell lymphoma, five of seven with follicular/marginal zone lymphoma, and five of nine with DLBCL as well as nine of 13 with chemoresistant disease [&lt;ulink linkID="641177" linkType="Reference"&gt;641177&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2005, clinical data on Bexxar were presented at the 52nd SNM meeting in Toronto, Canada. Updated complete response (CR) durability data were provided for a trial, which enrolled 60 NHL patients between November 1996 and March 1998. A total of 12 patients acheived a CR, and 9 had durable remissions of more than 4 years following only 1 week of therapy [&lt;ulink linkID="610035" linkType="Reference"&gt;610035&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Two further Bexxar studies showed that there was a consistently higher CR, overall response and duration of response with Bexxar than with prior chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="610067" linkType="Reference"&gt;610067&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Additional data on Bexxar were also presented [&lt;ulink linkID="610046" linkType="Reference"&gt;610046&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="610057" linkType="Reference"&gt;610057&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="610069" linkType="Reference"&gt;610069&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2010, further data were presented at the 52nd ASH meeting in Orlando, FL. At study completion, 12 patients were alive and 48 had died; 6 complete responders were alive with 5.0 to 11.8 years continued survival. Median response duration for complete responders was 9.9 years [&lt;ulink linkID="1150317" linkType="Reference"&gt;1150317&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2003, clinical data on Bexxar were presented at the 45th ASH meeting in San Diego, CA.  Of 230 patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL who were treated with Bexxar in the five clinical trials that supported regulatory approval of the agent and who were evaluable for response, 55 met the definition of a durable complete response (complete resolution of radiological abnormalities and disappearance of signs and symptoms related to the disease). Investigators reported that 75% of those patients (41/55) still showed no sign of disease after a median follow-up of nearly 5 years [&lt;ulink linkID="517610" linkType="Reference"&gt;517610&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A phase II single-arm, multicenter study examined retreatment with Bexxar in 32 patients who relapsed after an initial response of at least 3 months to the Bexxar therapeutic regimen. With a median follow-up of more than 2 years, responses were reported in 18 patients, with a median duration of 10.7 months. Seven patients experienced a complete response and the median duration of complete response was not reached. Median progression-free survival was nearly 12 months (11.8 months; range, 6.2 months to 17.0 months). Response and duration of response following retreatment were independent of the degree of prior response to Bexxar [&lt;ulink linkID="517612" linkType="Reference"&gt;517612&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A third study analyzed the Bexxar therapeutic regimen in sequential treatment with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) chemotherapy for previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma. Twelve patients received the Bexxar therapeutic regimen; 10 of the 12 patients completed the subsequent CHOP chemotherapy. CHOP was given in six cycles, at 3-week intervals, beginning 13 to 16 weeks after the Bexxar therapeutic regimen. The overall response rate to Bexxar was 83%, with a complete response rate of 50%. The overall response rate for the 10 patients who completed subsequent CHOP chemotherapy was 90% and all of those were complete responses. There were three relapses at 6, 9 and 12 months post-treatment. The median duration of response had not been reached at that time, though follow-up remained short [&lt;ulink linkID="517613" linkType="Reference"&gt;517613&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="516505" linkType="Reference"&gt;516505&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2003, updated phase II data from a trial conducted between July 1998 and February 2001 with Bexxar were presented at the 39th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL. The trial, which involved 44 patients was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of this treatment at first or second recurrence of B-cell NHL. At 3-year follow up the overall response was 76% (31 of 41 patients) with 46% (19 of 41) eventually achieving a complete response or unconfirmed complete response. Median duration of response for all patients was 1.3 years (95% CI: 8 months to no reached), but for the complete responders, median duration of response has not yet been reached. Therapy was well tolerated with grade 3 or 4 anemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in 10, 44 and 21% of patients, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="491151" linkType="Reference"&gt;491151&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="491468" linkType="Reference"&gt;491468&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2003, clinical data on Bexxar were presented at the 39th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL. A retrospective study investigated whether Bexxar induced myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in patients with follicular lymphoma. Data demonstrated that patients who had been heavily pretreated with Bexxar had a similar incidence of AML and MDS as patients who had only received chemotherapy, while patients who had not previously received Bexxar had no cases of AML or MDS [&lt;ulink linkID="491294" linkType="Reference"&gt;491294&lt;/ulink&gt;]. More data released at the conference detailed a study in patients (n = 368) who had received 75 cGY total body dose (TBD) of radiation from Bexxar. The hematological toxicity associated with this dose of the drug was considered acceptable [&lt;ulink linkID="491296" linkType="Reference"&gt;491296&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Another poster described a long-term follow-up of patients with relapsed, refractory or transformed low-grade NHL. Of 250 patients, 76 with poor prognostic characteristics (30.4%) had lasting responses with a time-to-progression of at least one year. Median follow-up was 44.6 months and the percentage of this group having a complete response was 76%. One patient has survived for more than 8 years [&lt;ulink linkID="491300" linkType="Reference"&gt;491300&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Also in May 2003, at the 39th ASCO meeting in Chicago, IL, further clinical data on Bexxar were presented. A subset of NHL patients (n = 124) with mild thrombocytopenia who received a total body dose (TBD) of 65cGy from Bexxar were compared to a subset (n = 419) of patients with a platelet count &amp;gt; 150,000/mm3 who received 75cGy. Despite a decrease in TBD radiation from 75 to 65cGy for patients receiving Bexxar therapy with platelet counts between 100,000 and 150,000/mm3 at study entry, grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia remained increased compared with patients who had a platelet count &amp;gt; 150,000/mm3 at study enrollment [&lt;ulink linkID="491152" linkType="Reference"&gt;491152&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Data from three phase II/III studies were presented in May 2002, at the 38th ASCO meeting in Orlando, FL. A response was reported in 79 of the 117 patients, including a confirmed response in 34 of 54 patients with bulky disease and 17 of 27 patients with very bulky disease [&lt;ulink linkID="452434" linkType="Reference"&gt;452434&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2001, data from a large multicenter, expanded-access study of Bexxar, begun in July 1998 and completed in March 2000, were presented at the 37th ASCO meeting in San Francisco, CA. In total, 368 patients were enrolled with a variety of subgroups including the elderly, &lt;ulink linkID="6736" linkType="Drug"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; failures, bulky disease, prior radiotherapy, bone marrow involvement, as well as relapsed/refractory patients with low grade/transformed NHL, and in all cases efficacy and tolerability were demonstrated. Neither the duration of response nor the response rate was affected by the dosing interval between the time of completion of the administration of unlabeled Bexxar and the commencement of administration of Bexxar. Likewise, there was no significant difference in the grade 3/4 hematological toxicities observed between those groups of patients [&lt;ulink linkID="410176" linkType="Reference"&gt;410176&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="409618" linkType="Reference"&gt;409618&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="410400" linkType="Reference"&gt;410400&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="410408" linkType="Reference"&gt;410408&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="410404" linkType="Reference"&gt;410404&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="410413" linkType="Reference"&gt;410413&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="410427" linkType="Reference"&gt;410427&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="410421" linkType="Reference"&gt;410421&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="409101" linkType="Reference"&gt;409101&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="473545" linkType="Reference"&gt;473545&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2000, integrated efficacy data from 251 patients treated with Bexxar during a period of 10 years, who had low-grade or transformed low-grade NHL, also showed that Bexxar achieved a 35% complete response rate lasting a median of more than 3 years. Previously untreated patients experienced a complete response rate of 58%. Patients who had received four or more prior chemotherapy treatments had a 24% complete response rate with a median duration of 19 months. Patients with transformed low-grade lymphoma experienced a complete response rate of 31% with a median duration of 20 months [&lt;ulink linkID="392165" linkType="Reference"&gt;392165&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 1999, long-term follow-up data from patients treated in all of the company's clinical trials were presented at the International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma in Lugano, Switzerland. Bexxar was administered to 432 NHL patients at approximately 40 centers throughout the US and UK. Most of these patients were heavily pretreated with a median of three prior chemotherapy regimens. At the time of the analysis, 249 of the 432 patients (58%) were free of disease progression. Of the patients, 183 had progressed following Bexxar treatment, 156 of whom received over 300 subsequent therapies. The majority of patients (65%) went on to receive chemotherapy following Bexxar. Short-term side effects associated with Bexxar included a decrease in blood counts, which was generally reversible and self-limiting, and a mild-to-moderate flu-like syndrome that was observed in approximately one-third of patients. Longer-term side effects were infrequent and included increases in thyroid stimulating hormone in a small percentage of patients. Myelodysplastic syndrome also was noted in a small percentage of patients for whom the cytogenetics of analyzed cases was generally consistent with previous exposure to chemotherapeutic agents [&lt;ulink linkID="327120" linkType="Reference"&gt;327120&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 1999, data from 179-patient phase I to III trials were reported at the 41st ASH meeting in New Orleans, LA, in which 81% responded to Bexxar, compared to 52% who had responded to their last chemotherapy. Additionally, 39% experienced a complete response of their disease following Bexxar, compared to 14% experiencing a complete response to their last chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="349571" linkType="Reference"&gt;349571&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="350225" linkType="Reference"&gt;350225&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In other studies, initial experience suggests that Bexxar can be safely administered to NHL patients who had previously received &lt;ulink linkID="6736" linkType="Drug"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkID="350234" linkType="Reference"&gt;350234&lt;/ulink&gt;], and that Bexxar's effective t1/2 was shorter in patients with splenomegaly or higher tumor burden and longer in patients with minimal residual disease or decreased tumor burden [&lt;ulink linkID="350228" linkType="Reference"&gt;350228&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 1998, full results of a US multicenter, phase III trial evaluating Bexxar's efficacy in treating patients with low-grade and transformed low-grade NHL resistant to chemotherapy were presented at the ASH meeting in Miami, FL [&lt;ulink linkID="310468" linkType="Reference"&gt;310468&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="432677" linkType="Reference"&gt;432677&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Results showed that more patients experienced remissions with a single therapeutic dose of Bexxar compared to their last chemotherapy regimen and that Bexxar remissions were of longer duration. By December 1999, a total of 233 patients had been enrolled into this program since 1990 [&lt;ulink linkID="308381" linkType="Reference"&gt;308381&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="349463" linkType="Reference"&gt;349463&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 1998, Interim results of a pivotal, multicenter phase II/III study, involving low-grade NHL patients refractory to chemotherapy, was presented at the American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) (Phoenix, AZ) [&lt;ulink linkID="280357" linkType="Reference"&gt;280357&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Preliminary results from 30 patients on the trial showed that 22 of them had adequate follow-up data to contribute towards the primary endpoint of duration of response. Of 13 of the nonequivalent cases, ten experienced a longer duration of response on Bexxar, compared to three of 13 who experienced a longer response on prior chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="287061" linkType="Reference"&gt;287061&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 1998, Coulter completed the interim phase III trial of Bexxar in the US, to evaluate its efficacy in low-grade and transformed low-grade NHL patients resistant to chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="228931" linkType="Reference"&gt;228931&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="301655" linkType="Reference"&gt;301655&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patient recruitment was completed in March 1998, with the target enrollment (n = 61) reached. The primary endpoint of this study was durability of response, compared with the durability of response on a previous chemotherapy course [&lt;ulink linkID="281934" linkType="Reference"&gt;281934&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="282221" linkType="Reference"&gt;282221&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Preliminary results showed that there was a significant improvement in primary (duration of response to therapy) and secondary (overall response rate) clinical endpoints [&lt;ulink linkID="301880" linkType="Reference"&gt;301880&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="303142" linkType="Reference"&gt;303142&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2001, clinical data on Bexxar were presented at the 43rd ASH meeting in Orlando, FL. Bexxar showed greater activity than unlabeled Bexxar in 78 patients with relapsed/refractory NHL. In a phase II trial (SWOG 9911) of CHOP followed by Bexxar in newly diagnosed follicular NHL, 80% of patients achieved an objective response. A further study (SWOG 0016) was to investigate the CHOP plus Bexxar combination with CHOP alone or CHOP plus &lt;ulink linkID="6736" linkType="Drug"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkID="432766" linkType="Reference"&gt;432766&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="432782" linkType="Reference"&gt;432782&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="475679" linkType="Reference"&gt;475679&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2001, data were published from a study exploring the safety and efficacy of Bexxar in comparison to patients' previous chemotherapy. A partial or complete response (CR) to Bexxar was observed in 65% of patients, as compared to a 28% response rate from patients' last chemotherapy agent. Results for patients obtaining a CR were 20% after Bexxar, in comparison to 3% after treatment with their previous agent. For those patients who achieved a CR with Bexxar, the median duration of response had not yet been reached and nine of the 12 patients with CRs had ongoing responses ranging from 32.3 to 47.4 months [&lt;ulink linkID="424055" linkType="Reference"&gt;424055&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="424138" linkType="Reference"&gt;424138&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2000, results from a multicenter, phase II study of Bexxar involving low-grade and transformed low-grade NHL patients who failed to respond to, or progressed, following &lt;ulink linkID="6736" linkType="Drug"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment were reported at the 42nd ASH meeting in San Francisco, CA. In 40 evaluable patients, Bexxar produced a 70% overall response rate and a 40% complete response rate in patients previously treated with rituximab. The median time to progression for responding patients was 17 months. The 24 patients in the study who had no response to prior rituximab therapy achieved an overall response rate of 67% with Bexxar and a complete response rate of 25%. Results from this study demonstrated that treatment with Bexxar was well tolerated with predictable and reversible hematologic toxicity [&lt;ulink linkID="392165" linkType="Reference"&gt;392165&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="393807" linkType="Reference"&gt;393807&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Also in December 2000, at the 42nd ASH meeting in San Francisco, CA, integrated efficacy data from 251 patients treated with Bexxar for 10 years, who had low-grade or transformed low-grade NHL, showed that Bexxar achieved a 35% complete response rate lasting a median of more than 3 years. Previously untreated patients experienced a complete response rate of 58%. Patients who had received four or more prior chemotherapy treatments had a 24% complete response rate with a median duration of 19 months.

A total of 76 previously untreated patients with advanced-stage, low-grade, NHL were treated with Bexxar as a first-line therapy. Tumor shrinkage was observed in 97% of patients participating in the trial; 76% achieved a complete remission [&lt;ulink linkID="367790" linkType="Reference"&gt;367790&lt;/ulink&gt;] (63% as quoted in the abstract [&lt;ulink linkID="367966" linkType="Reference"&gt;367966&lt;/ulink&gt;]). A phase II study conducted at two centers in the UK between July 1998 and November 1999 was also presented at ASCO 2000. In this study in pretreated B-cell NHL patients (previous treatment included &lt;ulink linkID="6736" linkType="Drug"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; and high-dose therapy) an overall response rate of 64% (21 of 33) was observed, with six patients showing complete remission and 15 showing partial remission.

In this study, patients were to be retreated with the therapy. This open-label trial was to include all histologies, namely low, intermediate and high-grade NHL patients who had relapsed from their initial Bexxar treatment, and include only patients negative for seroconversion to the antibody [&lt;ulink linkID="290052" linkType="Reference"&gt;290052&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 1998, results from a group of patients who were retreated as part of the phase I/II trial indicated that Bexxar can be safely re administered to patients with NHL. Of six patients who achieved a complete response to initial treatment, five responded to retreatment, with three achieving a second complete response [&lt;ulink linkID="289308" linkType="Reference"&gt;289308&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In 1998, data from phase I/II trials that demonstrated that Bexxar produces prolonged complete responses and is effective in all phases of the management of low-grade and transformed NHL were presented [&lt;ulink linkID="288719" linkType="Reference"&gt;288719&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Results from the phase I/II trial at the &lt;ulink linkID="20623" linkType="Company"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/ulink&gt; showed that a response was produced in 42 out of 59 patients, with a complete response in 20 patients [&lt;ulink linkID="289203" linkType="Reference"&gt;289203&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Most of these 42 patients had failed more than four previous treatment regimens with chemotherapy. Overall, 83% responded, with 48% achieving complete response and 35% a partial response.

I-131-tositumomab was tested as front-line therapy in 76 patients and FLIPI scores were used to predict outcome. A single 1-week course of treatment resulted in overall and complete response rates of 95 and 75%, respectively, and the  5-year follow up median progression-free survival was 6.1 years. FLIPI scores were available for 74 of the 76 patients: 11 (15%) were low risk, 37 (50%) were intermediate risk, and 26 (35%) were high risk. The rates of complete response in each group were 82, 73 and 73%, respectively. An overall survival difference was seen when low and intermediate risk patients were grouped and compared against high-risk patients.

An increasing number of unconjugated antibodies, immunotoxins and radio-immunoconjugates (RICs) have the potential to benefit patients with NHL and other hematological malignancies [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429481"&gt;429481&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;One of the most promising RICs is Bexxar (&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="9028"&gt;tositumomab&lt;/ulink&gt;; &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15542"&gt;Corixa Corp&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="28355"&gt;GlaxoSmithKline plc&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="308118"&gt;308118&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="385809"&gt;385809&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It is composed of an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody B1 linked to 131I. The CD20 antigen present on the surface of most normal and malignant B-cells provides an ideal target for a monoclonal antibody because it is not shed, modulated or internalized. B1 is a murine IgG2a anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that effects cell kill by inducing apoptosis, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429392"&gt;429392&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429395"&gt;429395&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;B1 was first developed over 20 years ago at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429396"&gt;429396&lt;/ulink&gt;] and was approved by the FDA as a diagnostic agent in 1982. The radiolabeled antibody entered clinical trials in 1990 in both non-ablative and ablative forms. In 1993, Kaminski and coworkers published the first efficacy data [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="169333"&gt;169333&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The pivotal trial was initiated in 1996, completed in 1998 and published in 2001 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="228931"&gt;228931&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="424138"&gt;424138&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 1999, Bexxar was filed with the US FDA. It was granted Priority Review status and designated a Fast-Track product [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="329969"&gt;329969&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="333654"&gt;333654&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;131I is primarily a gamma emitter that permits individual patient dosimetry. The t1/2 of 131I is about 8 days. The beta-emission characteristics include a relatively short path length (average 0.8 mm; maximum 2.4 mm). The cross fire from these high-energy beta particles results in cell kill of not only CD20+ cells, but also neighboring antigen-negative tumor cells. The short path length limits toxicity to normal surrounding tissues.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;No data are currently available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Only limited preclinical data on Bexxar have been published, but Buchsbaum et al have investigated pre-dosing with an unlabeled antibody prior to injection with 131I-labeled anti-B1 antibody. Athymic nude mice bearing human Raji Burkitt lymphoma xenografts were injected with 100 microg of unlabeled anti-B1 antibody 2 h prior to administration of 0.3 microg radiolabeled antibody. When the animals were tested 4 days later, the animals that had received pre-injection of unlabeled antibody had 44%-greater tumor uptake, which was considered significant [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="433081"&gt;433081&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Buchsbaum et al also investigated the effect of increasing the radioisotope dose from 300 to 450 microCi in the same preclinical model. This did not produce a significant difference in tumor regression [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="433080"&gt;433080&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;Bexxar is administered in three stages with four patient visits over 1 to 2 weeks [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="424138"&gt;424138&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Since non-tumor localization of 131I is primarily in the thyroid, the patient receives super-saturated potassium iodide from day 1 to day 14 following the therapeutic dose. Nevertheless, because of myelosuppression by the antibody, patient eligibility for clinical trials has required &amp;lt; 25% bone marrow involvement. On day 0, an unlabeled pre-dose of 450 mg cold &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="9028"&gt;tositumomab&lt;/ulink&gt; is delivered to occupy accessible non-tumor sites (for example, circulating B-cells and splenic B-cells) and to improve the penetration of 131I, along with 5 mCi Bexxar (35 mg) to determine the pharmacokinetics. Whole-body gamma counting is performed on day 0; then day 2, 3 or 4, and finally on day 6 or 7. On days 7 to 14, the therapeutic dose is delivered, comprising 450 mg cold &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="9028"&gt;tositumomab&lt;/ulink&gt; with sufficient mCi of Bexxar 35 mg to deliver the desired cGy of total-body dose, as determined by gamma counts. The actual 131I activity administered to each patient varies from 45 to 177 mCi. Administration of the agent is usually managed by a dedicated team consisting of a medical hematologist or oncologist, nuclear medicine technologist, nuclear pharmacist, oncology nurse, radiation safety officer, and oncology or radiology nurse coordinator. Radiation oncologists are also involved in some institutions. The RIC can be administered in the outpatient setting in most states in the US, using precautions similar to those observed with other radio-iodine therapies [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="281337"&gt;281337&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;No data are currently available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;Escalating the pre-dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="9028"&gt;tositumomab&lt;/ulink&gt; from 0 to 95 to 475 mg was associated with prolongation of the t1/2 of Bexxar from 63 to 73 to 85 h, respectively. Increased tumor bulk and splenomegaly were both associated with shortening of the t1/2 of the antibody. The 475 mg dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="9028"&gt;tositumomab&lt;/ulink&gt; provided superior tumor targeting and had clinical activity. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the radiolabeled antibody was 75 cGy in patients with a normal platelet count. In this case, the absorbed dose in the bone marrow was approximately 100 cGy, with higher doses resulting in unacceptable myelosuppression. The MTD was 65 cGy in those with a platelet count between 100,000/mm(3) and 149,000/mm(3) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="253091"&gt;253091&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="350228"&gt;350228&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II &lt;/subtitle&gt;A pilot study initially published by Kaminski et al from the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20623"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/ulink&gt; was updated with 53 patients with follicular low-grade or transformed NHL who had failed prior chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="253091"&gt;253091&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429410"&gt;429410&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The response rate was 71%, including 34% complete responses (CRs), and was higher (83%) in de novo low-grade NHL or transformed NHL than in de novo large-cell NHL (41%). The median progression-free survival was 12 months for the responders and 20.3 months for the complete responders. Patients (n = 16) were retreated after relapse following Bexxar therapy; in this group, there were nine responses including five CRs, with a median progression-free survival of 11.4 months. Five patients developed MDS 1.2 to 7.5 years after treatment with Bexxar. All had received a median of four previous regimens, some containing alkylating agents and the cytogenetic abnormalities suggested that the MDS was secondary to prior treatment. Of interest was a 64% response rate in small lymphocytic lymphoma, with 21% CRs [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="350224"&gt;350224&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Kaminski et al used Bexxar as the initial treatment for 76 patients with follicular NHL. The response rate was 97%, including 63% CRs. The median duration of response had not been reached as of this publication [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="288678"&gt;288678&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="367966"&gt;367966&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Vose et al reported a multicenter trial in 47 patients. The response rate was 57% in patients with low-grade histology and 60% with transformed NHL. The CR rate was 32%, including 50% of those patients with a transformed histology. The median durations of response and CR were 9.9 and 20 months, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429427"&gt;429427&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Leonard et al reported on the overall multicenter experience in 269 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade NHL. Most had received substantial prior therapy; 25% were previously untreated. Bone marrow was involved in about half the patients (but &amp;lt; 25%) and almost a third had bulky disease. The confirmed CR rate was 28% with a median duration of 5 years. The CR rate correlated with the extent of disease and responsiveness to prior treatment; these were 58% CR (44% confirmed) as front-line therapy, and 29 and 22% for one to three, and four or more prior regimens, respectively. In addition, there was a longer duration of CR in the previously untreated group (median duration of CR not reached at 1.5 years median follow-up) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="394388"&gt;394388&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Horning et al demonstrated that patients who failed &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6736"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; (Rituxan; &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17085"&gt;IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp&lt;/ulink&gt;/&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="26178"&gt;F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd&lt;/ulink&gt;) responded to Bexxar. The overall response rate was 57%, including 14% CRs, lasting a median of 16 months. The median time to progression for all patients and for responding patients was 6 and 19 months, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="393807"&gt;393807&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An expanded access program was initiated to provide the drug to patients prior to its commercial availability [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="299649"&gt;299649&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The data from this trial demonstrated that Bexxar was effective and safe outside the context of clinical trials at academic centers [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="350234"&gt;350234&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429439"&gt;429439&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429442"&gt;429442&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Press and coworkers used ablative doses of 131I anti-CD20 antibody either alone or in combination with chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="182576"&gt;182576&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429450"&gt;429450&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429451"&gt;429451&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The progression-free survival following this procedure was longer than with the patients' longest previous remission or with their last prior chemotherapy, suggesting benefit from the RIC [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429450"&gt;429450&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The same investigators also conducted a phase I/II trial of Bexxar with etoposide and cyclophosphamide [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429451"&gt;429451&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The results compared favorably with historical patients who received conditioning with total body irradiation and similar chemotherapy. Further development of combinations is underway and should be compared prospectively with standard regimens.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Leonard and coworkers investigated a combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6156"&gt;fludarabine&lt;/ulink&gt; followed by Bexxar based on in vitro synergy data [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429453"&gt;429453&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="350230"&gt;350230&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Following &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6156"&gt;fludarabine&lt;/ulink&gt; there were two CRs and 11 partial remissions. After Bexxar treatment, four of the partial responses became complete, and a patient with stable disease was converted to a partial response. Nevertheless, it is difficult to ascertain the contribution of the &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6156"&gt;fludarabine&lt;/ulink&gt; since this response rate is comparable to data that has been previously reported with Bexxar alone [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="367966"&gt;367966&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Most, if not all, patients treated with Bexxar will relapse and will require additional treatment. Recently published data suggest that subsequent therapy is active and generally well tolerated [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432709"&gt;432709&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III &lt;/subtitle&gt;The Southwest Oncology group is conducting a randomized phase III trial comparing cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) alone, CHOP combined with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6736"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; and CHOP followed by Bexxar in patients with newly diagnosed follicular NHL (grade I, II or III) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432701"&gt;432701&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A multicenter (non-randomized) pivotal trial included 60 patients with a median of four prior regimens (range two to 13). Eligibility included low-grade or transformed indolent NHL [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="310468"&gt;310468&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="424138"&gt;424138&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="432677"&gt;432677&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients were required to have failed at least two prior regimens and to have relapsed within 6 months of completing that therapy, or to have been resistant to that regimen. Those with a transformed NHL had to have received a regimen suitable for treating an aggressive NHL. They had to have at least one lesion 2 cm or larger and no more than 25% of the intertrabecular bone marrow space affected by NHL. All patients were required to have adequate performance status, renal and hepatic function, with an absolute neutrophil count of 1500/mm(3) and = 100,000/mm(3) platelets. The data were reviewed by a Masked Independent Randomized Radiology and Oncology Review (MIRROR) panel [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="288798"&gt;288798&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="350235"&gt;350235&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Almost all patients (98%) had stage III or IV disease and 56% had bone marrow involvement. There were 60% of patients with low-grade histology, 38% who had transformed to an aggressive histology and a single patient with mantle cell NHL [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="424138"&gt;424138&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, 65% had a tumor of at least 5 cm and 88% had at least two risk factors from the International Prognostic Index [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429480"&gt;429480&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Responses to Bexxar were reported in 65% of cases (81% in those with a low-grade, primarily follicular histology), including 20% CRs. Response rates correlated with histology, tumor burden, prior radiotherapy and the number of prior therapies. The best response to the previous therapy had been a CR in 3%, partial response in 25%, stable disease in 38% and progression in 33% of patients. When compared with Bexxar, 28% had an equivalent duration of response to their last qualifying therapy; of the remaining cases, 26% had a longer response with their last qualifying therapy and 74% had a longer response with Bexxar (53% overall). The median duration of response of 6.5 months was also significantly longer than the last qualifying therapy (3.4 months), and the median duration of response for the CRs was not reached at a median follow-up of 47+ months, compared with 6.1 months for the patients' previous therapy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="424138"&gt;424138&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The longer response duration with a subsequent therapy is unusual for chemotherapy treatment of low-grade NHL [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206657"&gt;206657&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;To date, more than 1000 patients have received Bexxar in both the academic and community settings. Infusions of Bexxar are well tolerated, with only 4% of patients requiring a rate decrease because of an infusion reaction [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429427"&gt;429427&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The most common adverse events are grade I/II asthenia (39%), fever and nausea (both 35% grade I/II; 2% grade III/IV), and headache (21%, with &amp;lt; 1% grade III/IV). Chills, myalgias, anorexia, arthralgia, rash and pruritus occur with a frequency of &amp;lt; 20%.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The major toxicities of Bexxar are mild-to-moderate, transient neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Nadir counts typically occur from 4 to 6 weeks after therapy with recovery to grade II by weeks 8 to 9. Grade IV neutropenia occurs in 17% of cases, thrombocytopenia in 3% and anemia in 2%, with a median neutrophil nadir of 1100/mm(3), platelets 63,000/mm(3) and hemoglobin 11 g/dl, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="350225"&gt;350225&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this series, 12% of patients received platelet transfusions and 10% red blood cell transfusions. Myeloid growth factors or erythropoietin were given to 12% of patients. Whether subsequent chemotherapy can be delivered safely and effectively has not yet been demonstrated. Although all patients received thyroid protection, elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels occurred in 8.5% of patients.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The adverse events of greatest concern are acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and MDS, which have been reported in up to 6.3% of patients and are likely related, at least in part, to prior chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="429410"&gt;429410&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Since Bexxar is constructed from a murine antibody, patients are at risk of developing human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). This complication has the potential to reduce the efficacy of subsequent antibody administration. In patients treated with Bexxar after receiving prior chemotherapy, the risk of HAMA is approximately 9%, whereas it has been reported to be 65% when the antibody is given as a front-line treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="367966"&gt;367966&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Development of HAMA has also been suggested to be associated with a flu-like syndrome. HAMA formation does not interfere with response to subsequent &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6736"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt; treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="393921"&gt;393921&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Pretreatment with an immunosuppressive agent, such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6156"&gt;fludarabine&lt;/ulink&gt;, can reduce the frequency of HAMA [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="350230"&gt;350230&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Corixa and GlaxoSmithKline anticipate launch of the product in the US in 2002 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="424619"&gt;424619&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A likely approved indication will be to use Bexxar at the time of failure of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6736"&gt;rituximab&lt;/ulink&gt;.
