was developing uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP, INS-316) as a potential sputum-expectoration enhancing agent for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases including lung cancer. In May 2001, the drug entered phase III trials to evaluate the efficacy of UTP in diagnosing lung cancer [&lt;ulink linkID="485744" linkType="reference"&gt;485744&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By 2003,  the compound was not listed on the company's pipeline; however, it was stated still to be in development as a lower priority product candidate [&lt;ulink linkID="590074" linkType="Reference"&gt;590074&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="590076" linkType="Reference"&gt;590076&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, no further development has been reported.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;ulink linkID="17661" linkType="Company"&gt;Kirin&lt;/ulink&gt; had been collaborating with Inspire for the development of the diagnostic use of UTP [&lt;ulink linkID="384859" linkType="Reference"&gt;384859&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, the agreement was terminated in September 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="590076" linkType="Reference"&gt;590076&lt;/ulink&gt;]. UTP was previously being developed by Inspire for the potential treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) [&lt;ulink linkID="267848" linkType="reference"&gt;267848&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, by May 2002, following a strategic decision by the company, all development of the compound as a therapeutic agent was discontinued [&lt;ulink linkID="452617" linkType="reference"&gt;452617&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Sputum Expectoration&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2001, a phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy of UTP in diagnosing lung cancer was initiated. The 800 patient trial was to be conducted at 36 sites in the US, Canada and Costa Rica [&lt;ulink linkID="485744" linkType="reference"&gt;485744&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By April 2003, UTP had been tested in over 300 patients in a series of clinical trials. These trials had demonstrated UTP to be well tolerated and to enhance sputum expectoration by several fold in a dose-dependent manor [&lt;ulink linkID="485744" linkType="reference"&gt;485744&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia and   CF&lt;/subtitle&gt;In July 1996, UTP was granted Orphan Drug status in the US for the treatment of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). By this time, INS-316 also had Orphan Drug status for the treatment of CF and Subpart E designation for the treatment of both CF and PCD [&lt;ulink linkID="267849" linkType="reference"&gt;267849&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By December 1995, Inspire was conducting phase II trials of UTP for the treatment of CF and primary ciliary dyskinesia, and was expecting to initiate clinical studies in chronic bronchitis during 1996. By this time, the compound had also undergone initial clinical testing for a variety of pulmonary indications at the &lt;ulink linkID="20634" linkType="Company"&gt;University of North Carolina&lt;/ulink&gt;. To address near-term opportunities for improved diagnosis of certain lung infections and lung cancer, Inspire was also developing UTP's ability to increase production of deep sputum specimens. Additional indications for UTP at this time included enhancing the mucus clearance of patients in critical care settings in order to reduce their risk of pneumonia [&lt;ulink linkID="267848" linkType="reference"&gt;267848&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Bronchitis&lt;/subtitle&gt;In April 1998, data from double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials showed that UTP improves expectoration of sputum in chronic bronchitis patients [&lt;ulink linkID="285786" linkType="reference"&gt;285786&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;MISCELLANEOUS&lt;/subtitle&gt;Administration of UTP to sheep produced an increase in tracheal mucus velocity and lung mucociliary clearance, when compared to controls [&lt;ulink linkID="364623" linkType="reference"&gt;364623&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;UTP targets and activates the P2Y2 purinergic receptor in the lungs, the central coordinator of the mucociliary clearance process [&lt;ulink linkID="298311" linkType="reference"&gt;298311&lt;/ulink&gt;], which triggers a number of events resulting in a decrease in mucus viscosity and an increase in the clearance of mucus from the lungs. UTP stimulates chloride secretion by activating two cellular chloride channels: the CFTR channel, which is defective in patients with cystic fibrosis, and an alternative chloride channel that is intact in those individuals. The result is increased hydration within the aqueous layer, and subsequent liquefication of mucus [&lt;ulink linkID="196745" linkType="reference"&gt;196745&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="267848" linkType="reference"&gt;267848&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><AdditionalInformation><displayLabel>Additional Information</displayLabel><value>&lt;AdditionalInformation&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2000, Inspire granted an exclusive license in Asia to Kirin for the development and commercialization of  the diagnostic UTP [&lt;ulink linkID="384859" linkType="Reference"&gt;384859&lt;/ulink&gt;].

UTP binds to metabotropic purinergic receptors (P2Y2 subclass) causing an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Elevations in [Ca2+]i elicit a variety of downstream cellular effects including changes in the activity of plasma membrane ion channels. Epithelial ion channels regulate the secretion of ions, fluid, and macromolecules across the epithelial monolayer and consequently influence the viscosity and depth of the periciliary airway fluid layer and mucociliary clearance. In CF airway cells, the downstream target of UTP is a Ca2+-activated Cl- conductance located on the apical membrane [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391695"&gt;391695&lt;/ulink&gt;], and a Ca2+-activated K+ conductance on the basolateral membrane [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391622"&gt;391622&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391708"&gt;391708&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The location of P2Y2 on the apical membrane of the airway epithelial cell - in close proximity to the apical channel effectors - makes it accessible to inhaled aerosolized medications, without the complications associated with systemic administration. Thus, P2Y2 is an attractive therapeutic target for conditions in which mucociliary clearance is compromised. Research suggests that P2Y2 may also be a valuable therapeutic target in the CNS, cardiovascular, renal, pancreatic and hepatic systems [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="267851"&gt;267851&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;UTP is a triphosphoribose derivative of uracil and is available commercially. Chemical synthesis from the monodeoxyonucleotide to the triphosphate takes place in the presence of excess carbonyldiimidazole in five steps [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452693"&gt;452693&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Under cellular conditions, uridine monophosphate (UMP) is synthesized from glutamine, aspartate, and in some tissues, orotate [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452206"&gt;452206&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A second source of UTP in addition to de novo synthesis is the deamidation of cytidine to uridine. A specific enzyme (UMP kinase) and a non-specific nucleoside diphosphokinase are responsible for phosphorylating uridine to generate UTP. Both sources of UTP can contribute to the free UTP pool. In cells, UTP is used for the synthesis of RNA, cytidine triphosphate (CTP), deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP), and is metabolized to UDP-sugars and CDP-phospholipids [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452206"&gt;452206&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Free UTP is stored in granules at a level of about 10% of ATP. UTP can be released from cells in a manner similar to that proposed for ATP, namely via exocytosis and mechanical stress. Whether or not UTP can be specifically released by transport through P-glycoprotein (MDR1) or CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), as has been proposed for ATP remains controversial. The amount of UTP released from cells under physiological conditions ranges between 1 to 5 nM per 3 x 10(5) cells under basal conditions [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452601"&gt;452601&lt;/ulink&gt;], to up to 200 nM in platelets subjected to mechanical stress [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452614"&gt;452614&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In platelets exposed to thrombin, the increase was of the order of 10-fold that of the basal level [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452614"&gt;452614&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;UTP is either equipotent or more potent than ATP at P2Y2 receptors, although this is not the case for all receptors of the P2Y subclass. A limiting factor in the effectiveness of UTP as a P2Y2 agonist, however, is the degradation of UTP by ectonucleotidases. This limitation may be overcome by UTPgammaS (uridine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), which is not susceptible to degradation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452618"&gt;452618&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Uracil, the breakdown product of UTP has fewer side effects than adenosine, (the breakdown product of ATP), which interacts with a variety of P1, P2Y and ionotropic P2X receptors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452636"&gt;452636&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Recent synthesis of UTP analogs in which the ribose group is replaced with fused cyclopropane rings has resulted in a new generation of compounds. While this structural modification in general improved the EC50 for ATP at P2Y receptors, at P2Y2, however, the EC50 was not enhanced over that seen for the naturally occurring ribose-containing compound (0.091 +/- 0.005 microM versus 0.085 +/- 0.012 microM for the methanocarba- and ribose-containing derivatives, respectively), as determined by the activation of phospholipase C in astrocytoma cells stably expressing P2Y2. Furthermore, similar modification of UTP did not improve the EC50 above that seen for the naturally occurring compound (0.0159 +/- 0.007 microM versus 0.008 +/- 0.002 microM, for the methanocarba- and ribose-containing derivatives, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="436126"&gt;436126&lt;/ulink&gt;]). As with UTPgammaS, however, one advantage of the methanocarba derivatives may be that they are more resistant to hydrolysis by ectonucleotidases. Bidentate ligands, (eg, Ap4A and diadenosine tetraphosphate) can elicit effects from P2Y2, although the effectiveness as compared to UTP is variable [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452262"&gt;452262&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452633"&gt;452633&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, these observations may indicate a requirement for two nucleotides to be bound at the receptor [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452691"&gt;452691&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Molecular modeling of P2Y2 has suggested that polar residues in transmembrane domains 3, 5, 6 and 7 contribute to ligand binding. In addition, the extracellular loops of these receptors may also be involved in agonist binding [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452507"&gt;452507&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Inhaled UTP is associated with increased ciliary beat frequency (EC50 = 4.7 microM [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452630"&gt;452630&lt;/ulink&gt;]), although in explants of human nasal tissue, this response declined over 15 min. In contrast, the increase in ciliary beat elicited by ATP was sustained over this time frame, which may reflect additional activation of ciliary beating via binding of the hydrolysis products of ATP to an A2B adenosine receptor [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452630"&gt;452630&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In airway epithelial cells of CF origin, UTP (200 microM), evoked a significant increase in the depth of the pericilliary fluid layer and increased isotonic fluid secretion, but had less of an effect on the height of airway surface liquid (ASL) in cultures of normal human airway cells [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452635"&gt;452635&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Concomitant with reduced Cl- transport, the CF lung phenotype is characterized by increased amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption mediated by the epithelial Na+ channel, ENaC. Importantly, UTP has been reported to reversibly inhibit the increased Na+ transport associated with CF in freshly excised human tissue [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452625"&gt;452625&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This effect may be mediated via the increase in cellular [Ca2+] evoked by purinergic receptor activation of phospholipase (PL)A2 and is consistent with previous reports in cultured and native cells [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391685"&gt;391685&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391692"&gt;391692&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452622"&gt;452622&lt;/ulink&gt;]. UTP also stimulates mucin secretion by airway epithelial cells (UTP = ATP = ATPgammaS &amp;gt; UDP = ADP &amp;gt; alpha betaMeATP &gt;&gt; adenosine), and importantly, UTP alone stimulates mucin gene (MUC5AC and MUC5B) expression [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452226"&gt;452226&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The effect of UTP to increase mucin production has been proposed as a useful tool to obtain samples for the assessment of airway inflammation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452634"&gt;452634&lt;/ulink&gt;] and lung cancer [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="408613"&gt;408613&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Exposure of alveolar type II cells to UTP or ATP is also associated with the increased production of surfactant, probably via activation of PLC and PLD [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452688"&gt;452688&lt;/ulink&gt;] to produce phosphatidylcholine.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Numerous studies have reported on the ability of UTP to increase Cl- transport in airway epithelia [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391692"&gt;391692&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391700"&gt;391700&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391667"&gt;391667&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452324"&gt;452324&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These reports have formed the basis of the proposal that UTP may be of therapeutic advantage in airway diseases marked by impaired mucociliary clearance, such as chronic bronchitis, in addition to CF [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445517"&gt;445517&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452222"&gt;452222&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="395400"&gt;395400&lt;/ulink&gt;]. UTP is a more effective secretagogue at apical than at basolateral membranes of polarized epithelial cells, leading to the suggestion that either different receptor subtypes are expressed at opposite membranes and/or Ca2+ is present in membrane-restricted pools [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452639"&gt;452639&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The effectiveness of UTP as a secretagogue also varies with development of the appropriate receptor. In fetal rat lung, apical P2 receptors develop prior to basolateral P1 receptors, and it has been suggested that this contributes to regulation of fluid secretion in the fetal airway [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452212"&gt;452212&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Interestingly, Ap4A has been proposed as a more stable alternative to UTP; it has been reported that this compound mobilized intracellular Ca2+ although the EC50 for this response was considerably greater (17 microM) than that for UTP (1.8 microM) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452542"&gt;452542&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Whether or not Ap4A is acting as a general P2Y agonist, is acting via a specific diadenosine receptor, and whether the reduced effectiveness of Ap4A to increase [Ca2+]i is compensated by a greater resistance to hydrolysis, remains to be determined. Importantly, a second generation dinucleotide polyphosphate compound is currently under development as a P2Y2 agonist for the treatment of CF, retinal detachment and edema and sinusitis (&lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="31594"&gt;INS-37217&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="377666"&gt;377666&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="397536"&gt;397536&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;One drawback in the mechanistic elucidation of UTP interactions with P2Y2 has been the lack of appropriate antagonists. Pretreatment of both native and transfected cells expressing P2Y2 with UTP reduced the effectiveness of a second exposure to the nucleotide, consistent with receptor desensitization. The IC50 for this response was 0.3 to 1 microM, and recovery times were prolonged [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391670"&gt;391670&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391690"&gt;391690&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The underlying mechanism may involve receptor phosphorylation by Ca2+-dependent kinases [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="391670"&gt;391670&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Suramin, a weak P2 antagonist does block P2Y2, but with approximately 10-fold lower affinity than its interaction at P2Y1 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452507"&gt;452507&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The rank order of potency of block is P2Y1 &amp;gt; P2Y2 &amp;gt; P2Y4. It only weakly discriminates between classes of receptor, and also inhibits ectoATPases with micromolar affinity [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452691"&gt;452691&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Other purinergic antagonists, eg, Reactive Blue 2 and pyridoxal phosphate derivatives (PPADS) are ineffective antagonists at P2Y2 and can have non-specific effects [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452691"&gt;452691&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A recent report that methyl orange acts as a specific UTP antagonist in a concentration range of 10 to 100 microM in rat superior cervical ganglia may, however, provide a starting point for the development of more specific blockers [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452266"&gt;452266&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism &lt;/subtitle&gt;Released UTP is subject to hydrolysis by a variety of 5'-ectonucleotidases that are bound to the extracellular surface of cellular membranes. Stepwise hydrolysis of successive phosphate groups results in the generation of free uridine. Free uridine is salvaged by transport back into the cell via either Na+-dependent and/or Na+-independent transporters for further conversion into uracil [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452206"&gt;452206&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Basal concentrations of UTP in the airways of normal and CF patients were 37 +/- 7 nM, and 33 +/- 12 nM, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452280"&gt;452280&lt;/ulink&gt;]; concentrations sufficient to activate the endogenous receptors. Rates of release were also similar, suggesting that CFTR does not play a role in regulating UTP release. The primary route for exogenous UTP administration in man is via aerosolization. Little information on the systemic metabolism and elimination of UTP administered via aerosol is available; even though it should be assumed that some proportion of the inhalate is swallowed. Inhalation of UTP (0.1 M) by sheep significantly increased mucus velocity and mucociliary clearance, as measured by clearance of [99mTc]-HSA, peaking between 15 to 30 min after drug administration [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="364623"&gt;364623&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar studies in patients with PCD using clearance of [99mTc]-iron oxide particles in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study, demonstrated that a single dose of UTP (17.5 mg) significantly increased clearance for up to 2 h post-administration [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452632"&gt;452632&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similarly, in patients with mild chronic bronchitis, UTP (20 mg) doubled the rate of clearance as compared to control [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="445517"&gt;445517&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A higher dose of UTP was no more effective. In an escalating-dose study in CF patients clearance of [99mTc]-iron oxide, aerosolized UTP (10(-5) M to 10(-2) M) alone or in combination with amiloride (5 x 10(-3) M) increased clearance to values seen in normal patients, although the effect was short lived, peaking at about 40 min post-administration [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="452222"&gt;452222&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The protocol for the study involved testing on 3 separate days.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;No significant safety concerns with the administration of either UTP alone or in combination with amiloride were evident at the doses (10(-5) M to 10(-2) M UTP; 5 x 10(-3) M amiloride) used [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="395400"&gt;395400&lt;/ulink&gt;]. There were no consistent changes in spirometry, arterial blood gases, or the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide, although a small decrease (average 5 mm Hg) in PaO2 was seen. Other physiological parameters, such as heart rate, blood pressure and ECG were unaffected [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="395400"&gt;395400&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Small, transient changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were, however, noted. These findings suggest that inhaled UTP with or without amiloride is well tolerated under the conditions of exposure to the drug. No data is available concerning toxicity over a longer time-course of administration or over successive daily administration.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;Phase I trials of a UTP-related compound (INS-365) mobilized respiratory secretions [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="301626"&gt;301626&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In 1995, UTP was undergoing phase II clinical trials for the treatment of CF and PCD [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="267848"&gt;267848&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In patients with chronic bronchitis, phase I/II double-blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrated that UTP produced a 3-fold increase in lung clearance as compared to baseline rates. Single and multiple inhaled doses improved expectoration of sputum in non-smokers, smokers and patients with bronchitis [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="285786"&gt;285786&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;Inspire has launched a phase III clinical trial to establish the effectiveness of UTP as a diagnostic aid in providing deep lung samples for detection of lung cancer. The trial is a placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel-group comparison of two concentrations of UTP in inhaled solution and involves 600 patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="408613"&gt;408613&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="436386"&gt;436386&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No results are currently available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;Under the conditions studied so far, UTP is a safe and well-tolerated drug. No significant adverse reactions have been reported. Cough is the most frequent side effect [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="301626"&gt;301626&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;The effectiveness of UTP to increase mucociliary clearance and fluid and electrolyte secretion has been studied in a wide variety of epithelial cells. While studies of clearance are appropriate to airway epithelia, UTP has also been found to increase fluid secretion in epithelial cells of non-pulmonary origin. In the limited number of human studies undertaken so far, UTP is an effective promoter of airway clearance. The lack of significant safety issues would suggest that UTP or one of its derivatives is/are a prime candidate(s) to improve clearance and quality of life in patients with COPD and other non-asthmatic airway diseases such as CF, where activation of the P2Y2 is a desirable therapeutic objective. Local delivery via inhalation reduces safety concerns while improving therapeutic effectiveness. In combination with other drugs such as amiloride, inhaled UTP or one of its derivatives offers significant potential for the amelioration of airway symptoms associated with CF, bronchitis and PCD.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="22360">Inspire Pharmaceuticals Inc</Company><Country id="US">US</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="DX"
