The primary outcome will be HIV incidence at community      level measured in a randomly selected cohort of approximately 40,000 adults (HPTN071      population cohort). The trial will be sponsored by DAIDS and will be managed via the HIV Prevention      Trials Network (HPTN). Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01900977.<br/>The TREATS project will be nested within two of the arms (intervention arm A and the control      standard of care, arm C) of the ongoing HPTN 071(PopART) trial. Originally HPTN071 had two      intervention arms (arm A and B) that differed in that both had the same community      intervention (see below) but in arm A, HIV positive individuals received universal ART      regardless of CD4 count whereas in arm B national guidelines on CD4 count will be used. During      the trial the thresholds for commencement of ART have changed such that universal ART      regardless of CD4 count will be provided in all arms of the trial. For this reason, the TB      outcomes will only be measured in the full intervention arm (arm A) and the standard of care      arm (arm C)<br/>Randomization of the 21 communities (clusters) for the HPTN071 trial will be done using matching      of triplets. Within each triplet, one community was randomly allocated to each of the three      study arms, using a process of restricted randomization to ensure balance on key covariates.      Communities will be matched into triplets by geography and estimated baseline HIV prevalence.      The randomization will be done in a public ceremony in 2013. For practical reasons there will be no      blinding of which cluster will bw in which intervention arm, however laboratory staff analysing      biological samples for the primary outcomes will be blinded to the arm of the study, and      investigators will  be blinded to outcome data beyond baseline.<br/>Intervention : the HPTN071(PopART) intervention (arm A) consists of a package of combination TB/HIV      prevention activities, including active case finding (ACF) for TB and universal test and      treat (UTT) for HIV. The intervention wil be  delivered over a period of four years by community      health workers called community HIV care providers (CHiPs) who will be responsible for a zone of      their community. They went door-to door within their zone ensuring that every member of the      population had access to HIV and TB prevention messages, annual TB symptom screening, HIV      testing and sexually transmitted infection screening, condoms, referral to voluntary male      medical circumcision and, for HIV positive individuals, referral to care and ART regardless      of CD4 count. During each annual visit, each member of the community was screened for      symptoms of TB and sputum samples taken from any who will be symptomatic for TB diagnosis, and      tested using Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) in individuals who were HIV-positive and      smear microscopy for those who were HIV-negative. All symptomatic individuals will be followed      up to ensure that results will be available and appropriate referrals will be made for further      investigation if required. Diagnosed cases of TB were referred to care through routine      government health care facilities (HCF) and will be treated with standard 6-month TB regimens      for drug-susceptible TB and referred for treatment according to national guidelines if they      had drug-resistant disease. All TB treatment will be provided by government HCF. All HIV positive      individuals who presented to the clinic for HIV care were screened for TB using a symptom      screen, with symptomatic individuals being tested using Xpert MTB/RIF according to standard      national policy, and were offered isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) if they will be      non-symptomatic. The CHiPs collected data on the uptake of the intervention (CHiP data).<br/>Standard of care: the standard of care arm C communities will access to HIV testing services (usually at the      health facility), HIV care and ART provision according to national guidelines, which since      mid-2016 includes ART initiation regardless of CD4 count. TB case finding will be  'passive' ie,      relies on individuals to present with symptoms to the health facility. TB diagnostics will be as      per national guidelines including Xpert TB/RIF for those who were HIV positive. All diagnosed      cases of TB will be treated as in the intervention arm.

Census zones will be further      subdivided into ""blocks"" that each include approximately 40 to 60 households, having 100 to 150 adults (> 15 years). The blocks will be grouped geographically to enable stratified sampling, which      will ensure there will be good geographical coverage of the whole community. The blocks will be      randomly sampled, with stratified sampling, and then all households within a sampling block      will be eligible for inclusion in the study until the targeted sample size of 4000      participants will be reached for that specific community.<br/>Recruitment: centrally in each census zone a mobile field site (MFS) will be set up where the OneStopTB      Platform (a truck, containing a digital X-ray and Xpert instrument) will be stationed and      tents will be erected to conduct the different survey procedures. Community mobilization      activities will be conducted to sensitize community members and then each selected zone will      be enumerated block by block.

Individuals &lt;18 years will provide      written assent and will need written consent from their parent or guardian before      participating in the study.<br/>Procedures and Activities: all enrolled participants, following consent/assent will be asked a set of questions to      determine socio-demographic and other key characteristics of the survey population for      analysis. Individual factors may include smoking, alcohol, education, marital status, history      of working in the mines, being a health care worker. Questions around TB stigma as well as      questions about HIV testing, HIV status, ART use and exposure to the PopART intervention will      also be included. Socio-economic status will also be determined at a household level. Using      an invitation card with barcode all enrolled participants will be invited for TB screening at      the MFS.<br/>Upon arrival at the MFS participants will be logged in at the reception desk using the      barcode where their identity and eligibility will be checked after which TB screening will be      conducted. TB screening will consist of symptom screening and chest X-ray for all enrolled      participants. Detailed questions around health seeking behaviour will be asked to all those      reporting symptoms. Digital chest X-ray (CXR) images will be read automatically using CAD4TB      (version 5), a software product that takes a single frontal chest radiograph as input, in the      form of a DICOM image, and produces several outputs.<br/>All individuals who either have a positive symptom screen and/or an abnormal CXR (based on      their CAD4TB score) will be eligible for sputum examination. Participants refusing to undergo CXR      or symptom screen will automatically be sputum eligible. All sputum eligible will be asked to      provide sputum samples for TB diagnosis using Xpert MTB/RIF. Xpert testing will be conducted      in the mobile truck by a trained technicians and results should be available within 2 hours.      All those diagnosed with TB after confirmatory testing, will be referred to the nearest      health facility for treatment initiation/ linking to care, following the country's national      TB treatment guidelines. Confirmatory testing will be needed in a TB prevalence survey setting to      avoid false positive results given the lower level of TB prevalence then the routine clinic      setting. In case of error results, the test will be repeated.<br/>All participants will be offered HIV counselling testing using rapid tests as per standard      protocol as the last step of survey procedures at the mobile field site. Those with known HIV      positive status will not be retested. Any newly diagnosed HIV positive will be linked to ART      care. The research team will ensure the results of the CXR will be given back to participants. This can      be in real time or potentially as requested by the participant through a different route for      those who don't wish to wait for their CXR results. These results can be given back for the      participant to attend a second visit, through a household visit by the research team or by      text message.<br/>To ensure other findings in the lungs besides TB are properly addressed, all images with a      high CAD4TB score (to be confirmed after the pilot) will be read by an experienced      radiologist at a central location via tele reading to investigate whether there is need for      referral for other lung conditions than TB. Referrals will be made to the nearest appropriate      HCF depending on the findings. Any participant not attending for clinical follow up will be      checked by the research team within 2 to 4 weeks from the test.<br/>Implementation Science Studies<br/>Secondary data Analysis: secondary data analysis will use two data sources:<br/>Routine TB case notification data (held in TB registers and containing information on           all patients starting TB treatment, including microbiology results, HIV-status and           treatment outcomes), for all adults residing in the Pop-ART communities (N = 330,000) from           2014 to 2018.<br/>Population cohort data (N  = 28,000) linked to TB case notification data. Detailed           individual-level data will be collected annually on the cohort, over approximately 36 months           of follow-up for each participant (between 2014-2018). At each visit, cohort members are           asked if they have started TB treatment in the preceding year and, if so, unique TB case           identifier numbers from patient cards are obtained. Population Cohort data will be           linked to TB case notification data allowing all TB diagnoses in the cohort to be           verified and microbiology results and TB treatment outcomes to be determined.<br/>Data collection and management: TB case notification data between 01/2011 to 12/2018, with      treatment outcomes to 06/2019, will be collected. This allows historical trends and data      during and immediately following the PopART intervention to be investigated. Population      cohort data will be linked to TB case notification data. Anonymised datasets (Population      cohort data linked to TB case notification data and overall TB case notification data) will      be generated and used to address the study objectives.<br/>As part of HPTN071, data on the intervention uptake in the intervention sites only are      captured electronically and summarised annually. These intervention process measures will be      used to document how uptake of the intervention, especially TB screening and diagnosis,      varies across communities and to explore the association between these measures and TB case      notification rates at community-level. In addition, the intervention process measures will be      analysed by age, gender and other socio-demographic characteristics to explore inequities in      intervention uptake/distribution by different population groups.<br/>Qualitative Studies<br/>Qualitative studies will be conducted in both Zambia and South Africa The following activity      will be performed as close as possible to the end of the PopART intervention period.<br/>Semi-structured interviews with individuals aged >/= 18 and their households who are part of      an existing qualitative cohort to explore the relationship between TB and HIV, popular      understanding of TB, options for managing TB, TB stigma and the implications of missing TB      cases. A cohort representing different HIV decisions and outcomes (to test/not test,      HIV-negative/HIV-positive, People living with (PLHIV) on treatment/PLHIV not on treatment)      and different gender and age groups was established by the PopART social science team from      2016-2018. Approximately 8 individuals in one arm A and C community per country (n = 32) and      their households will be revisited and asked TB-specific questions.<br/>The following activities will also be conducted.<br/>Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders providing TB services, to determine TB           services available (arm A and C), including a historical perspective of the history of           TB services in each particular site. Investigators will liaise closely with the           community engagement team for this activity.<br/>Focus Group Discussions with 10-12 Community HIV Care Providers (CHiPs) in each Arm A           site (n=84 approximately), to document restrospectively their experiences of delivering           TB services within the wider PopART intervention and with particular communities.<br/>In-depth interviews with key TB staff to describe their experience with TB service           delivery and the role of other stakeholders (n = 14; arm A and C).<br/>In-depth interviews with TB patients and their households in intervention sites (n = 49 to           7 per Arm A Site across both countries). In-depth interviews will be conducted using           participatory techniques including body mapping and network charts (for mobility and TB           pathways) to determine the role of CHiPs, the patient's experience of falling ill with           TB and the enablers and barriers to diagnosis and treatment from a household and patient           perspective.<br/>In-depth interviews with TB patients and their households diagnosed through passive case           finding (standard of care at health facility level) in health facilities in intervention           sites (n = 49 to 7 per Arm A Site across both countries). The research tool will be similar           to the comparative interview of those diagnosed through CHiPs but explore, rather, the           role of the health facility and other services. TB patients will be identified through           the TB services at the health facility and in each site it would be aimed to recruit a           range of age and gender groups (aged 18 and over). Investigators will ask TB patients if           they can accompany them home and interview them and their household members at home.<br/>Matematical modelling: the model software will be developed through the project as an open source R package, with      the core deterministic compartmental transmission model written in Fortran 90.<br/>There will be three main components to this model development work:<br/>Adaptation of an existing underlying demographic and HIV/ART model that has been           developed for the PopART trial in discussion with the PopART HIV-modelling team<br/>Adapting an existing TB transmission model in this framework to represent the TB           interventions in TREATS, and contact the TB data collected by PopART and TREATS<br/>Adapting this product to generate output data and perform analyses required for health           economic evaluation of the TB intervention<br/>Component 1: HIV transmission will be modelled phenomenologically, with HIV incidence and      changes in ART coverage derived from the estimates from the PopART HIV-modelling to ensure a      consistent account of HIV epidemiology. To facilitate this, the underlying      demographic/HIV/ART structure (currently 81 age categories, two sexes, HIV-uninfected + 7 CD4      categories for PLHIV, and 4 ART durations) and the HIV/ART natural history parameters will be      modified to ensure the demographic/HIV/ART model substrate aligns with the approach taken in      the PopART HIV modelling. The focus will be in reproducing in the TB model substrate the      patterns of HIV infection by age and sex, and the estimated distributions of CD4 cell count      and time-since-ART initiation, which strongly influence TB risk, to capture the influence of      the PopART HIV interventions on TB incidence.<br/>Component 2: the TB transmission model will follow established model structures (including      latent TB infection, fast and slow routes of progression to disease, re-infection and      progression, increased risks of relapse after treatment), and sit on top of the      HIV/demographic layer, accounting for increased risks of TB progression due to HIV-related      immune-compromisation (i.e. linking TB risk to CD4 count and time on ART). HIV/ART status      will also affect the natural history of TB disease. The model will also be modified to      include the TB active case-finding aspects of PopART, and to include a likelihood that      contacts the routine data and actively collected data (disease prevalence, infection      incidence).<br/>Component 3: to be used for projections and health economic evaluation, additional outputs      will be generated to, first, estimate incremental health benefits of future TB infections      averted in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), second, estimate healthcare cost      savings due to TB infections averted, and third, estimate incremental costs of active      case-finding for TB in the context of UTT projected into the future. In addition, the model      will need to be modified to project forward beyond the end of the intervention, and be made      flexible enough to consider other settings.<br/>Calibration: the approach to calibration will follow a fully Bayesian paradigm, with all      parameters treated as random variables with uncertainty described by prior distributions.      Sampling from the posterior will be undertaken using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)      techniques to generate samples that represent the uncertainty in all parameters, conditional      on the observed data. These samples (together with corresponding model outputs) will      therefore serve as a basis for appropriate probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) of      uncertainty surrounding certain outputs, including incremental benefits and costs of health      economic evaluations. Non-parametric techniques will be applied to the PSA datasets to obtain      estimates of multi-way parameter uncertainty and value-of-information. Calibration will      initially be undertaken before TREATS outcome results using baseline data and routine data.      This will serve as preparation for a final calibration including TREATS outcome data, and      allow an assessment of the improvement in precision generated by including the outcome data.<br/>Data analysis and preparation. There will be continuous effort to collate and analyse process      and outcome data from PopART and TREATS for use in modelling.<br/>Literature review: literature review work will be undertaken to generate data for modelling,      and to inform the economic evaluation. This will focus on two areas: recent epidemiological      literature informing on the natural history of TB for individuals on ART; and then later the      epidemiological characteristics of other settings identified as relevant to generalizing      findings beyond the PopART communities.<br/>Cost-effectiveness Analysis (CEA).<br/>The basic premise of the CEA of TREATS is to provide important information to decision-makers      on the following two aspects:<br/>Is a combination of UTT for HIV along with active case finding for TB worth implementing           as compared to standard care, in South Africa and Zambia, but also in other high endemic           countries?<br/>Are there economies of scope from jointly providing UTT and active case finding for TB           compared to only UTT for HIV?<br/>The epidemiological and economic analyses will be closely integrated. The CEA will take a      'Health systems' perspective and include all costs and benefits associated with provision of      HIV and TB care. Outcomes will be valued in terms of TB infections and DALYs averted, and      will be projected into the future.<br/>CEA data: calculation of the cost and benefits will use primary data collected from health service      facilities, data and results from other costing studies that have already been implemented      and published literature sources.<br/>Economic costs will be collected via a bottom-up micro-costing approach from intervention      expenditure data of Zambart and implementing partners, and compared against facility level      costing of HIV and TB prevention under Standard of Care. Costs components considered are      salary, test kits (Xpert), other equipment, and travel. Results of a time-and-motion study      conducted under HPTN071(PopART) will estimate the time spent by CHiPs on the TB component.<br/>The TREATS CEA will collect health facility costs of providing TB services in three health      facilities each in Zambia and South Africa. The objective of the facility level costing      survey is to estimate per-patient-per-year unit costs of typical TB related tests and      treatments. In both countries, two facilities from the control communities of PopART and 1      facility from the intervention communities will be chosen according to predefined criteria.      Health facility costs of HIV related care have already been collected under PopART from all      trial facilities.<br/>From the surveyed facilities, costs for prevention under standard of care will be collected      (such as household contact tracing and IPT provision), and components considered are salary,      test kits, and IPT. The costs of caring for TB patients at all stages of the disease will      also be collected from healthcare facilities, to calculate the healthcare costs saved of TB      infections averted. Shared expenditures on equipment, building, and general overheads will be      apportioned to TB prevention and care according to activity data. Unit costs estimates of the      cost per person tested and cost per TB case identified will be estimated. Costs of care for      drug-resistant TB, outside the surveyed health facilities, such as at tertiary health care      units will be gathered from secondary data sources.</para></ProtocolDescription>",Phase Not Applicable,PNA,null,Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection,null,TB Reduction Through ART and TB Screening Project,14905; NCT03739736; RIA2016S-1632; TREATS,null,360113,Recruiting

The      investigators would evaluate their DNA extraction/ quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays prospectively in specimens from      patients with paucibacillary TB, including extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) and smear-negative      pulmonary TB. Investigators would determine the number of Mycobacterial genomes, presence of      intact Mycobacteria, and precise location within plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or polymorphic mononuclear cells  (PMNs) in blood, or other      fluid or cells in a range of specimens. The second primary study objective would be to standardize      and validate a qPCR assay for early detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) drug      resistance directly from specimens. The investigators would further establish the feasibility      of using this highly sensitive assay to determine the ratio of Rifampin (RIF)-resistant to      RIF-susceptible bacteria in a given specimen.

For approximately 60% of all infant admissions occuring           at the ward, data from the child's health card will be documented during the admission, thus           registering the admission with the child's unique study identification number (ID) and other information transferred           from the card. The BCG scar status will be registered and the size will be measured upon           admission to the ward. To identify study admissions not registered with the unique study           ID, a standardized systematic database linkage and search algorithm is applied. Data on           consultations at HDSS health centers is collected as part of the routine BHP           surveillance.</para><para>All participating infants: Mortality data;<br/>Data on mortality will be collected from all           available information sources (admission at HNSM, telephone follow-up, HDSS data) and           any discrepancies in death information will be resolved by an extra telephone interview,           when applicable. For infant deaths within partipating families residing in the HDSS           study area, a standard verbal autopsy is performed approx. 3 months after the death.</para><para>Adverse events: <br/>To register adverse events from BCG vaccination in the form of suppurative      lymphadenitis, mothers will be given a detailed explanation of suppurative lymphadenitis and they      are encouraged at inclusion and at subsequent follow-up visits to bring their child to a HDSS      health center for consultation if such a condition should arise. Furthermore, participating      mothers will be asked on the phone whether their child has/has had a swollen lymph node in the      left armpit and if yes whether there has been secretion. At HDSS study area home visits,      partipating mothers will be equally asked and the size of the axillary lymph node is examined. A      size &lt; 16 mm as judged by the locally trained field assistants will be considered normal.</para><para>Sample size:<br/>The investigators will expect      to be able to include at least 15,600 children, ie, 7,800 in each BCG strain group.</para><para>Primary outcome: the investigators expect that around 4.5% will be hospitalized at HNSM      within the first 6 weeks of life. Thus, to detect if one of the strains is associated with a      20% lower admission rate with 80% power, an alpha of 0.05 and 10% loss to follow-up, 631      events will be necessary, which will be obtained with a sample size of 15,600 infants.<br/>Secondary outcomes: the investigators expect that at least 1.5% will die within the first 6      months of life. With a sample size of 15,600 infants, a 6 month mortality of 1.5% and 15%      loss to follow-up, the investigators will be able to detect if one of the strains is      associated with a 33% lower mortality rate with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05 (based on 196      events).</para><para>In the present study, the sample size should      be sufficient to show clinically relevant differences in BCG vaccination effects in the      child, depending on whether the mother has a BCG scar or not. In addition,  investigators will  tentatively      collect data on paternal BCG scar at inclusion and zone follow-up visits, if the father is      present.</para><para>Analysis:<br/>The hospitalization and mortality data will be analyzed as intention-to-treat in Cox      regression models with age as the underlying time variable, ie,  with complete adjustment for      age. In case an Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) or vitamin A supplementation campaign or similar      campaigns with potential immune stimulatory effects occurs during the study period, the main      comparison of the two strains will be conducted by censoring all children on the first day of      the campaign, to exclude any interaction of the campaign with the BCG strains.</para><para>As a sensitivity analysis, an analysis where same-day deaths and admissions (events occurring      on the day of BCG vaccination) are omitted will be conducted. In-hospital case-fatality rates      will be compared between strains in regression models. All analyses will be done overall and stratified by maternal BCG scar. Furthermore, the      investigators will study the independent effect of maternal BCG scar on trial outcomes. The      analysis will adjust for type of BCG vaccine that the child received and for possible      determinants of maternal BCG scar and morbidity/mortality, e.g. age, maternal mid-upper arm      circumference and ethnic group.</para><para>Trial vaccines:<br/>BCG will be acquired from the Japan BCG laboratory (BCG-Japan) and the Serum Institute of      India (BCG-Russia).<br/>Possible difficulties in procuring BCG vaccines: For a three year trial utilizing two specific      BCG vaccine strains, a backup for the proposed study vaccine strains is necessary as a strain      could become inaccessible due to production halts, worldwide shortages or logistic      difficulties in delivering the vaccines to Bissau. In such cases, the investigators proposes      to substitute study vaccines as follows:<br/>BCG-Russia will be substituted with either of the following, both derived from BCG-Russia:<br/>BCG-Russia (Russian BCG-I strain, Microgen, Russia)<br/>BCG-Bulgaria (BCG-SL 222 Sofia strain, InterVax Ltd., Canada/BulBIO LTD.,                Bulgaria).<br/>BCG-Japan will be substituted with either of the following, both derived from BCG-Japan:<br/>BCG-Taiwan (Tokyo 172 strain, Taiwan Center for Disease Control)<br/>BCG-Thailand (Tokyo 172 strain, Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute).</para><para>Data analysis if BCG strains will have to be substituted:<br/>Should it be necessary to substitute study BCG vaccines, study outcomes will be presented      both by pooling genetically similar strains (BCG-Russia + BCG-Bulgaria versus BCG-Japan + BCG-Taiwan/BCG-Thailand) and as a separate subanalysis, pending approval and      recommendations by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).</para><para>Ethical considerations:<br/>The proposed study will randomize children to two BCG strains that are widely used in      Guinea-Bissau and the rest of the world. Oral and written informed consent will be      obtained. The BHP offers free-of-charge medical consultations and some essential medications      at three health centers in the HDSS to all infants assessed for eligibility, independent of      the choice to participate or not. Participating mothers are encouraged to bring their child      for consultation at one of our health centers within theHDSS if their child develops suppurative      lymphadenitis.</para><para>The study has been approved by the Ethical Committee in Guinea-Bissau and the Central Ethical      Committee in Denmark has given its consultative approval.</para><para>This study consist of two treatment arms:<br/>Arm 1: infants randomized to receive BCG-Japan at discharge from the maternity ward will receive one 0.05 ml dose of Mycobacterium bovis BCG live attenuated BCG-JAPAN vaccine (Japan BCG Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan) by intradermal injection in the left deltoid region.<br/>Arm 2: infants randomized to receive BCG-Russia at discharge from the maternity ward will receive one 0.05 ml dose Mycobacterium bovis BCG live attenuated vaccine BCG-RUSSIA (Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) by intradermal injection in the left deltoid region.<br/></para></ProtocolDescription>",Phase 4 Clinical,C4,null,Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection,null,Comparing Morbidity and Mortality Effects of Two Different Strains of BCG,BCGSTRAIN II; NCT03400878,null,325929,Recruiting

null,"<ProtocolDescription><para>Monoclonal immunoglobulins arise from abnormal proliferation of a single clone of plasma cells. They are composed of a single light and/or heavy chain class, in contrast to polyclonal immunoglobulins. They may occur in malignant lymphoproliferative diseases, such as multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, amyloidosis, or more benign conditions such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Recently we have observed monoclonal gammopathy occurring in patients with tuberculosis. Whether tuberculous infection plays a role in the production of monoclonal protein, and whether the monoclonal immunoglobulins possess anti-tuberculous activity are unknown. In the current project we plan to study: (1) whether the monoclonal immunoglobulin developed in patients with tuberculosis reacts with tuberculous antigen (using ELISA), and (2) whether the VH gene sequence analysis of such patient shows different mutation patterns (indicating the presence of intraclonal mutation variation) or not. If there is no intraclonal mutation variation, it suggests that the plasma cell clone is not under current exposure to the mutator, and the production of monoclonal gammopathy is probably not related to tuberculous infection. If, however, the VH gene sequence analysis shows the presence of intraclonal mutation variation, it indicates that the plasma cell clone is continuously under the influence of the mutator. In such case the production of monoclonal protein may be related to tuberculous infection.</para></ProtocolDescription>",Phase not specified,NS,null,Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection; Paraproteinemia,null,Immunologic and Genetic Characteristics of Monoclonal Immunoglobulins in Patient With Tuberculosis,9461700601; NCT00173264,null,97715,Recruiting

Recursive partitioning methods will evaluate baseline MICs      and PK measures as drivers of treatment response (as described by the parameters of the PD      model of initial treatment response of Mtb load over time, and the endTB trial endpoints:      time to culture conversion, longer-term outcomes, and acquisition of phenotypic resistance).      The key drugs and plasma drug exposure thresholds for activity will be defined, and      exposure-dependent synergy or antagonism identified. The risks of toxicities (as assessed in      the endTB study) will be estimated, by plasma drug exposure and important comorbidity      (including HIV infection). In this way, the PK-efficacy and PK-toxicity analyses will allow      definition of target plasma drug exposures. Simulations will predict optimal doses. To      advance the understanding of drug penetration, the investigators will develop approaches to measure free      drug plasma concentrations. Drug-drug interactions will be described. PandrTB will      inform how best to use these new and repurposed drugs in combination, to create the most      effective and least toxic regimens while minimizing the development of further drug      resistance.</para></ProtocolDescription>",Phase Not Applicable,PNA,bedaquiline; delamanid; levofloxacin; linezolid; moxifloxacin,Multidrug resistant infection; Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection,null,Pharmacometrics to Advance Novel Regimens for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis-PandrTB Tuberculosis,NCT03827811; PANDRTB; PandrTB,null,368780,Not yet recruiting

Each person will have phlebotomy      for HBV and HCV Ab, LFTs, and if HIV+, CD4 testing (all of these are POC using Alere).

A survey to evaluate tuberculosis infection is conducted among undergraduate students of health related areas in two higher education institutions, consisting of the intradermal injection of PPD RT23 2 tuberculin units per 0.1 ml (donated by the Health Surveillance and Protection Commission - SUVISA of Bahia's State Epidemiological Surveillance Board) in the anterior forearm. The test result was assessed 48 to 72 h after by a technician certificated by the Ministry of Health, using a ballpoint pen and a ruler. Subjects with enduration diameter inferior to 5 mm were submitted again to the test 7 to 10 days after the first injection. Those subjects that remained negative (with enduration inferior to 5 mm) after both tests were invited to participate of the clinical trial. The allocation of subjects to either the test (revaccinated) or the control (no treatment) group is performed by simple randomization. The revaccinated group received a single-dose of intradermal BCG 0.1 mg/0.1ml of the vaccine routinely administered by the Ministry of Health. The subjects of this group are interviewed to obtain relevant information regarding socio-demographical and clinic-epidemiological parameters, and their blood was collected, in three evaluation periods: just before receiving the revaccination dose (time 0), 2 and 12 months after this intervention. 46 subjects composed this revaccinated group.

Furthermore, all children      born at home in the study area would be weighed and referred for BCG vaccination at the      health centres as quickly as possible. For mothers of LBW children, the current policy and      the purpose of the study would be explained. If she accepts participation, she would draw a      randomisation number indicating whether the children would be BCG vaccinated early or not. At      the time of enrolment, children would be examined clinically with anthropometrics, and major      risk factors would be documented (including TB exposure at home, recent infections, access to      malaria drugs, ethnic group, schooling, housing conditions, mother's recent drug      consumption). Newborns would only be included in the study if they were considered      sufficiently healthy to be discharged from the hospital, or when they would arrive at the health      centre if born at home. Twins would be a large part of the LBW children as twinning was common      in the study area (around 2% of births). They would be allocated to the same group, as there      could be confusion for the mother as to who had been vaccinated. As was happening at the      moment, mothers of children not receiving vaccination at birth would be recommended to attend      a local health centre as soon as the child had gained weight. For ethical reasons, it would      not be possible to use a placebo as this could mean that some children would not be BCG      vaccinated if the mother believed that the child had in fact been vaccinated. The children      who were not vaccinated initially would subsequently be vaccinated at the limited number of      health centres in the capital, which would administer BCG vaccination. The intradermal vaccination      technique and vaccine storage would be supervised, and it would be monitored as to whether      scar-formation and PPD reactivity was similar in children vaccinated at the different centres      to assure that vaccinations had been administered in the same way.</para><para>Follow-up: To assure proper identification of the children, the mother and newborn child      would be driven home to document the location of the home. The children included in the study      would be visited at 2, 6, and 12 months of age, to identify subsequent BCG vaccinations by      inspection of the vaccination card, to weigh the child and measure arm-circumference, to      assess BCG scarring and to document morbidity, hospitalisations and survival. Sick children      identified during these visits would be referred for treatment at the relevant health      institution. If the child had still not been vaccinated, the mother would be encouraged to      bring the child for vaccination. Should the child have died, a verbal autopsy would be      conducted. The children would be followed for morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality up      to 12 months of age. Within the study area they might be followed longer. In order to assure      detection of possible complications to BCG vaccination, LBW children enrolled in the study      would be provided with a card identifying the child, and the mother would be told to bring the      child for consultation at the local Health Centre where consultations and treatment would be      free of charge. The expected very rare complications would be treated according to WHO's      recommendations.</para><para>A subgroup of the children would be enrolled in immunological studies. To assess the effect      of BCG vaccination on the immune profile, initially unvaccinated LBW children would have a      blood sample collected when they turned up for BCG vaccination at a health centre. For each      child examined, a BCG vaccinated LBW child matched for age and sex would be examined and a      blood sample collected.</para></ProtocolDescription>",Phase 4 Clinical,C4,null,Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection,"<Outcomes><para>In October 2017, results of a pooled analysis of three randomized trials (<ulink linkType=""Protocol"" linkID=""192551"">NCT00625482</ulink>, NCT00146302, and <ulink linkType=""Protocol"" linkID=""109880"">NCT00168610</ulink>) were published.
