In March 2005, a pivotal phase III trial had been expected in early 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="590684" linkType="Reference"&gt;590684&lt;/ulink&gt;], however, following final data analysis of the latest phase II/III trials in March 2006, the company decided to first conduct an additional complementary 2-year trial to assess a more intensive, single-course dosing regimen  [&lt;ulink linkID="653212" linkType="Reference"&gt;653212&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Disappointing results  from this phase III trial were reported in January 2007 [&lt;ulink linkID="755782" linkType="Reference"&gt;755782&lt;/ulink&gt;] and, in February 2007, the Tolamba program for ragweed allergy was suspended. The company decided not to commit  any further significant resources to the program until an evaluation of trial design, a clear regulatory path and cost analysis of moving the program forward had been conducted [&lt;ulink linkID="768192" linkType="Reference"&gt;768192&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2007, Dynavax received funding for the program and a 300-patient clinical trial was planned, with  a potential BLA filing expected in 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="814170" linkType="Reference"&gt;814170&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in September 2007, a phase II trial for allergies and rhinitis was initiated; this had been completed by October 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="839480" linkType="Reference"&gt;839480&lt;/ulink&gt;].      In October 2007, a pivotal field study was expected to begin in the 2009 ragweed season [&lt;ulink linkID="842182" linkType="Reference"&gt;842182&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in May 2008, the company discontinued further development of the drug [&lt;ulink linkID="1004245" linkType="Reference"&gt;1004245&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The program was formerly being codeveloped by Dynavax and &lt;ulink linkID="22752" linkType="Company"&gt;UCB Pharma&lt;/ulink&gt;; however, in March 2005, the companies terminated their collaboration, leaving Dynavax with sole rights and financial responsibility for the program [&lt;ulink linkID="590618" linkType="Reference"&gt;590618&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Dynavax is also developing ISS, alone or delivered with appropriate antigens, for the prevention and treatment of other allergies and infectious diseases . &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;In July 2007, Dynavax was planning a 300-patient randomized clinical trial. Patients were to be screened and selected by exposure to ragweed allergen in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC) to identify those with confirmed severe ragweed allergic disease. Patients would then be randomized to receive Tolamba or placebo and re-exposed in the EEC to determine the effect of the 6-week, six-injection Tolamba regimen. Efficacy would be measured by the difference in total nasal symptom scores (TNSS) compared to placebo. At that time, data were expected in the first half of 2008,  and pending results, a  field study was to follow [&lt;ulink linkID="814170" linkType="Reference"&gt;814170&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2007, the phase II trial (NCT00537355; DV1-SAR-11) was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="839480" linkType="Reference"&gt;839480&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2007, dosing began in the trial [&lt;ulink linkID="842182" linkType="Reference"&gt;842182&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The trial had  been completed by October 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="839480" linkType="Reference"&gt;839480&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2004, Dynavax intended to meet with the FDA in early 2005 to discuss a   pivotal phase III program to begin in 2006. At that time, the company also planned to launch a phase III pediatric trial in 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="576822" linkType="Reference"&gt;576822&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This timeline was confirmed in March 2005 and September 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="590684" linkType="Reference"&gt;590684&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="622247" linkType="Reference"&gt;622247&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2006, however, following discussions with the FDA, Dynavax decided to conduct another safety/efficacy trial to determine whether a more intensive, single-course dosing regimen could elicit a better treatment effect than prior regimens. This multicenter, well-controlled study was expected to get underway by the end of the first quarter of 2006, and to complement data derived from the recently completed phase II/III trial and the ongoing pediatric trial. Results would be evaluated after both the 2006 and 2007 ragweed seasons  [&lt;ulink linkID="653212" linkType="Reference"&gt;653212&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2006, enrollment was completed for the randomized phase III trial. Prior to the 2006 ragweed season, 738 subjects aged 18 to 55 years, would receive 6 injections of Tolamba of three dosing regimens: a lower total dosing regimen consistent with the recently completed phase II/III trial; a higher total dose regimen; or placebo, for 6 weeks.  The primary endpoint  would be the reduction in total nasal symptom scores (TNSS) in the higher total dose arm compared to placebo during the 2007 ragweed season. At that time, an interim analysis was expected to be conducted in early 2007 [&lt;ulink linkID="524532" linkType="Reference"&gt;524532&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="672077" linkType="Reference"&gt;672077&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2007, the company reported that  subjects in the trial had shown no ragweed allergy, preventing the effectiveness of the drug from being determined and there was only minimal change from baseline in the trials' primary TNSS endpoint. At that time, Dynavax was   reviewing the data to determine the future of the program [&lt;ulink linkID="755782" linkType="Reference"&gt;755782&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In February 2007, data were presented at the American Acadamy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) in San Diego, CA. The company concluded that the enrollment requirement of a skin test and clinical history, was insufficient for selecting participants with measurable disease. The pediatric Tolamba trial suffered from the same limitation [&lt;ulink linkID="768192" linkType="Reference"&gt;768192&lt;/ulink&gt;]; at that time, Dynavax  announced  that it would not  commit any significant additional resources to the Tolamba program until it had further  evaluated   new trial designs, a clear regulatory path and costs associated with moving the program forward independently or with a partner [&lt;ulink linkID="768188" linkType="Reference"&gt;768188&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data from the DARTT (SAR09) trial were presented in November 2007 at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology meeting in Dallas, TX. Analysis of the placebo group showed that use of positive skin test parameters could enable the selection of patients with high ragweed-specific symptoms [&lt;ulink linkID="850229" linkType="Reference"&gt;850229&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2005, a phase III pediatric trial was initiated [&lt;ulink linkID="625208" linkType="Reference"&gt;625208&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By July 2005, the 19-center pediatric trial, aimed at supporting a pending pivotal phase III study, had enrolled 315 subjects aged between 6 and 15 years.  The primary endpoint of the double-blind  trial was reduction in hay fever symptoms after two seasons. A secondary endpoint was the prevention of the development of asthma symptoms over three years. Subjects would be treated with Tolamba or placebo in six doses over six weeks prior to the start of the ragweed season.  Two booster shots would be administered prior to the 2006 and 2007 seasons. Results of the primary endpoint analysis would be reported after the 2006 season, and the secondary endpoint results would be evaluated following the 2007 season [&lt;ulink linkID="611657" linkType="Reference"&gt;611657&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2007, the trial was suspended due to a lack of pronounced allergy symptoms in the overall patient population, preventing determination of the drug's efficacy [&lt;ulink linkID="768192" linkType="Reference"&gt;768192&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2004, Dynavax reported the initiation of a phase II/III 2-year trial to evaluate Tolamba. Prior to the 2004 ragweed season, 462 subjects would receive a 6-week regimen of either placebo or escalating doses of up to 30 microg of Tolamba. Some subjects would receive two additional booster shots prior to the 2005 ragweed season. The primary endpoint would be the change in nasal symptoms relative to placebo following the 2005 ragweed season. Secondary endpoints would be comparative medication use and quality of life parameters. An interim analysis would be performed at the end of the 2004 ragweed season [&lt;ulink linkID="524532" linkType="reference"&gt;524532&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2004, the trial completed enrollment. The immunization schedule was to be completed by June 2004, and a blinded interim analysis was to be undertaken in late 2004 to assess safety and the appropriateness of commencing a 1-year phase III trial in early 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="539625" linkType="reference"&gt;539625&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2004, an interim analysis from the 2004 ragweed season was published. Tolamba produced a positive impact on nasal symptom scores and other endpoints and was safe, with similar adverse reactions seen in the Tolamba and control arms. Based on these results, the company was to complete the trial as planned [&lt;ulink linkID="576822" linkType="Reference"&gt;576822&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2005, similar data were presented at the 63rd ACAAI meeting in Anaheim, CA, and final results were expected in the first quarter of 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="632969" linkType="Reference"&gt;632969&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="637146" linkType="Reference"&gt;637146&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2006, top-line results were released. The study's primary endpoint of reduction in total nasal symptom scores was met and clinical benefits relative to secondary endpoints, including hay fever symptoms and ocular effects, were seen. The results also demonstrated that booster shots were not required at the beginning of the second season [&lt;ulink linkID="645848" linkType="Reference"&gt;645848&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2006, further analysis of the 2-year phase II/III results were reported at the AAAAI meeting in Miami, FL. Interim analysis of the 2004 ragweed season (the first year of the trial) from complete study data showed that there was a 21% reduction in total nasal symptom scores in the Tolamba-treated group (p = 0.04). These data differed from previously announced interim data that showed a treatment effect of 18.8% (p = 0.06) [&lt;ulink linkID="653212" linkType="Reference"&gt;653212&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="653856" linkType="Reference"&gt;653856&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further results were reported in November 2006 at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology annual meeting in Philadelphia, PA. Tolamba induced a 2 to 3-fold increase in IgG anti-AMb a1 and did not induce an increase in IgE anti-Amb a1. A response analysis showed that efficacy of the drug was higher in the second season of administration [&lt;ulink linkID="741242" linkType="Reference"&gt;741242&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2002, clinical data on Tolamba were presented at the 58th AAAAI meeting in New York City, NY. In 56 subjects randomized to receive Tolamba or placebo sc once per week under a 6-week dose-escalation protocol, to peak at 12 mg, the injections proved to be well tolerated; however, both placebo and Tolamba-treatment groups were found to demonstrate a substantially diminished nasal congestive response to ragweed challenge after the treatment period, in comparison to baseline, and no difference was noted between these arms in terms of magnitude of the diminished response. At this time, blinded evaluation of symptoms and seasonal outcomes from this study was ongoing [&lt;ulink linkID="442183" linkType="reference"&gt;442183&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="443201" linkType="reference"&gt;443201&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="441113" linkType="reference"&gt;441113&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="443588" linkType="reference"&gt;443588&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="444184" linkType="reference"&gt;444184&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2001, Dynavax began a phase II/III, observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in the US, of sc administered Tolamba involving ragweed-allergic adults. The 40 subjects were to receive six sc administrations of Tolamba up to a maximum dose of 12 microg. The second trial, involving 60 patients, which began in April 2001 in Canada, was similar in design to the first [&lt;ulink linkID="409935" linkType="reference"&gt;409935&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;PHASE II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2003, data were presented on Tolamba at the 60th Annual AAAAI meeting in Denver, CO. A phase II dose-escalation study was performed in 27 patients with a history of ragweed allergic rhinitis and positive prick puncture to ragweed allergens. Significant increases in ragweed specific IgG in treated subjects suggested utility of Tolamba for treatment of ragweed rhinitis using a shortened, more convenient injection regimen. In human studies, a ragweed protein CpG DNA conjugate induced significantly less basophil histamine release compared with ragweed alone [&lt;ulink linkID="484636" linkType="reference"&gt;484636&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;At the 57th AAAAI meeting in March 2001 in New Orleans, LA, Dynavax reported preliminary results from the phase II trial of Tolamba for ragweed allergy. The phase II study explored the safety and immune response of Tolamba in a pool of 27 ragweed-allergic adults with a history of seasonal rhinitis. No serious vaccine-related adverse systemic reactions were observed. Antibody responses to ragweed allergen showed marked dose-related increases in allergen-specific IgG levels [&lt;ulink linkID="402579" linkType="reference"&gt;402579&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="404371" linkType="reference"&gt;404371&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="404423" linkType="reference"&gt;404423&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="412495" linkType="reference"&gt;412495&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;PHASE I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2005, phase I data were presented at the 62nd AAAAI in San Antonio, TX. Tolamba improved symptoms and reduced medication usage in ragweed allergy sufferers throughout the 2004 ragweed season. The randomized, single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial assessed safety and immunogenicity of up to 30 microg of the drug. A total of 18 patients received seven injections over 7 weeks, a regimen much shorter than the  6-month schedule of conventional therapy. Tolamba was shown to increase anti-ragweed and anti-Amb a 1 antibody IgG levels, with no increase in IgE levels, indicating the induction of a Th1 response. There were no serious local or systemic adverse events [&lt;ulink linkID="590684" linkType="Reference"&gt;590684&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By June 2004, Dynavax had completed immunization in a phase I pediatric trial of Tolamba in 24 children aged between 9 and 17 years receiving escalating doses of Tolamba. Only minor side effects were observed and no dose adjustments were required [&lt;ulink linkID="546119" linkType="reference"&gt;546119&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="632969" linkType="Reference"&gt;632969&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2002, clinical data on Tolamba were presented at SMi's Prevention and Treatment of Allergy meeting in London, UK. Tolamba induced 100-fold more antibody production and Th1 responses, including IFN-gamma, than ISS mixed with Amb a 1. Th1 responses were increased at the expense of Th2 cytokines more efficiently for the conjugate than the mixture. Tolamba was also 100-fold less allergenic than Amb a 1 in skin prick tests in allergic subjects. Tolamba treatment reduced symptom scores to the levels of pre-season scores and reduced medication use. Tolamba reduced eosinophil counts and IL-5 concentrations and increased IFN-gamma concentrations compared to placebo in nasal biopsies following antigen challenge [&lt;ulink linkID="467388" linkType="reference"&gt;467388&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 1999, Dynavax completed enrollment and patient dose administration in a phase I trial of Tolamba. The trial was initiated in July 1999, and was designed to evaluate safety and reactivity of Tolamba when administered by quantitative intradermal procedure to ragweed-allergic subjects. Final safety follow-up results from this phase I study, conducted at the Johns Hopkins Asthma Allergy Center, were expected by the end of 1999 [&lt;ulink linkID="337254" linkType="reference"&gt;337254&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Preliminary data from the initial phase I safety study, presented at the AAAAI meeting, March 2000, showed that, compared to licensed ragweed extract, Tolamba showed a decreased in vivo skin test reaction, ie was less allergenic [&lt;ulink linkID="383572" linkType="reference"&gt;383572&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The open-label safety study of Tolamba was performed on six ragweed-allergic subjects who received intradermal administration of Tolamba, and also ragweed separately, using 3-fold serial dilutions of each agent to calculate an endpoint reaction of sum at erythema = 50 mm (D50). Results showed that 184-fold (mean average) greater quantities of Tolamba were required to reach D50 compared to ragweed extract [&lt;ulink linkID="359633" linkType="reference"&gt;359633&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2002, preclinical data on Tolamba were presented at the 58th AAAAI meeting in New York City, NY. Using the nasal explant system, it was shown that preconjugated allergen-linked immunostimulatory DNA shows enhanced effectiveness in stimulating a Th1 response, whilst decreasing the Th2 response [&lt;ulink linkID="441272" linkType="reference"&gt;441272&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="444277" linkType="reference"&gt;444277&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2001, data were published on the delivery of ragweed-protein linked ISS (PLI) to PBMC cultures from patients with ragweed allergy. PLI exhibited potent cytokine modulating activity, by reversing the allergen-induced Th2 profile while enhancing IFN-gamma production [&lt;ulink linkID="443398" linkType="reference"&gt;443398&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2000, results of a study using Tolamba in a mouse model of ragweed allergy were presented at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 96th International Conference in Toronto, Canada. In this study, mice were sensitized to ragweed allergen by exposure to commercial ragweed extract. After sensitization, treatment with Tolamba significantly reduced asthma symptoms including airway hyper-responsiveness and esinophilia induced by subsequent pulmonary allergen challenge. Tolamba also significantly increased allergen-specific IgG antibody responses and interferon-gamma responses compared to untreated animals or animals treated with native allergen [&lt;ulink linkID="365974" linkType="reference"&gt;365974&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These results, presented at the ATS, contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the idea that Tolamba can divert the immune response away form harmful allergic reactions to ragweed in animal models. Further evidence includes the results of rabbit and cynomolgus monkey models published in July 2000, and a mouse model of allergic conjunctivitis published in July 2000 [&lt;ulink linkID="383572" linkType="reference"&gt;383572&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Further results presented at the AAAAI meeting in March 2000, showed that Tolamba decreased histamine release from human basophils harvested from ragweed-allergic subjects by 50-fold in comparison to Amb a 1 alone [&lt;ulink linkID="359633" linkType="reference"&gt;359633&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It was also reported at the conference that Tolamba showed increased immunogenicity compared to Amb a 1 in several animal species, including primates. Cynomolgus monkeys injected twice im with 50 microg of Tolamba developed high anti-Amb a 1 IgG responses, whereas injection with Amb a 1 did not induce a detectable antibody response above baseline. Results were also presented which indicated that Tolamba is able to modulate the production of cytokines in human PBMC obtained from ragweed-allergic subjects. Tolamba promotes a Th2 to Th1 switch in the type of cytokines produced [&lt;ulink linkID="356674" linkType="reference"&gt;356674&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="358957" linkType="reference"&gt;358957&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="358519" linkType="reference"&gt;358519&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Preclinical&gt;</value></Preclinical><AdditionalInformation><displayLabel>Additional Information</displayLabel><value>&lt;AdditionalInformation&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2007, Dynavax received $30 million from Deerfield Management for the development of its allergy programs, including Tolamba [&lt;ulink linkID="814170" linkType="Reference"&gt;814170&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2004, Dynavax licensed the technology, know-how and preclinical and clinical data related to its ragweed immunotherapy program to &lt;ulink linkID="22752" linkType="Company"&gt;UCB Pharma SA&lt;/ulink&gt; on an exclusive, worldwide basis [&lt;ulink linkID="521350" linkType="reference"&gt;521350&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2005, Dynavax Technologies and UCB Farchim SA terminated their development and commercialization collaboration for seasonal allergy products, leaving Dynavax with sole rights and financial responsibility for the program [&lt;ulink linkID="590618" linkType="Reference"&gt;590618&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2003, Dynavax was granted &lt;ulink linkID="PA3110464" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-06589940&lt;/ulink&gt; B1 [&lt;ulink linkID="496197" linkType="reference"&gt;496197&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 1998, Dynavax entered into a cross-license agreement with Vical for the use of Vical's DNA immunization technology. This agreement gives Dynavax and Vical exclusive worldwide rights to the use of each other's technology in combination with their own.

In allergic individuals, the immune response to otherwise innocuous molecules, such as pollen proteins, is characterized by high levels of Th2-like cytokines (eg, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13) and a lack of Th1-like cytokines (eg, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)). Specific immunotherapy (SIT) has proven to be an efficient treatment for allergic rhinitis and asthma in many controlled clinical trials. Successful treatment could be related to the reduction of the allergen-specific Th2-like immune response. Nevertheless, the risk of inducing undesired effects by administering allergen to patients limits the efficacy of SIT.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;To improve SIT for ragweed-induced seasonal allergy, researchers at Dynavax have developed a novel vaccine, termed Amb a 1 immunostimulatory oligodeoxyribonucleotide conjugate (AIC) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484516"&gt;484516&lt;/ulink&gt;]. AIC consists of the major ragweed pollen allergen Amb a 1 chemically conjugated to phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides containing immunostimulatory sequences (ISS-ODNs). ISS-ODNs act as adjuvants that support the development of Th1-like immune responses [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="404414"&gt;404414&lt;/ulink&gt;]. They contain central unmethylated CG pairs, which are frequent in bacterial DNA and are recognized by certain antigen-presenting cells as a danger signal via toll-like receptor-9. Chemically linking ISS-ODNs to an allergen represents a novel strategy to create a vaccine that combines both the downregulation of Th2-dominated allergic immune responses and an altered allergen structure, therefore reducing the risk of inducing adverse vaccine-related anaphylactic reactions. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR &lt;/subtitle&gt;Amb a 1 was purified from defatted complete ragweed pollen extract by DEAE-sepharose fast-flow anion exchange chromatography and butyl-sepharose fast-flow hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The phosphorothioate-modified ISS-ODN (ISS-1018; 5'-TGACTGTGAACGTTCGAGATGA-3') was chemically linked to purified Amb a 1 via maleimide-activated amino groups. The number of ISS-ODNs conjugated per allergen molecule was evaluated by the ratio of the molar content of each component. On average, it was estimated that there were four ISS-ODNs per Amb a 1 molecule [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484516"&gt;484516&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The chemical linkage of ISS-ODNs to an allergen may be advantageous in that, firstly, the conjugate stimulates the same antigen-presenting cell, which takes up and presents the allergen to T-lymphocytes to produce Th1-inducing cytokines. Thus, simultaneously with their activation, T-cells are promoted to differentiate into Th1 cells. Secondly, ISS-ODNs linked to an allergen may mask certain IgE-binding epitopes, which suggests that the ISS-ODN conjugate is less capable of cross-linking surface-bound IgE antibodies on mast cells, subsequently reducing the risk of inducing undesired, vaccine-related allergic side effects. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Preclinical studies indicate that AIC combines increased immunogenicity and Th1-supporting features with reduced allergenicity. The immunogenicity of AIC was evaluated in mice, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="356671"&gt;356671&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484516"&gt;484516&lt;/ulink&gt;]. AIC or equal amounts of Amb a 1 were administered in saline: mice were injected intradermally with 10 microg, two intramuscular injections with 10 microg were administered to rabbits, and monkeys were intramuscularly injected twice with 50 microg [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="356671"&gt;356671&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484516"&gt;484516&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In all species, higher anti-Amb a 1 IgG antibody titers were achieved with AIC compared with an equal amount of unconjugated Amb a 1 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="356671"&gt;356671&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484516"&gt;484516&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;To prove the Th1-inducing properties, AIC was injected intradermally into mice and compared with administration of equivalent amounts of Amb a 1 alone or Amb a 1 co-injected with the ISS-ODN [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484516"&gt;484516&lt;/ulink&gt;]. AIC-induced serum antibodies and in vitro cytokine responses of spleen cells were classified as Th1-like. Furthermore, allergen-specific IgE induction was prevented by administration of Amb a 1 adsorbed to alum [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484516"&gt;484516&lt;/ulink&gt;]. AIC suppressed Amb a 1-specific IgE formation more effectively than comparable amounts of unconjugated Amb a 1 in mice that had already developed a Th2-like immune response, indicating the therapeutic potential of AIC in SIT [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484516"&gt;484516&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a murine model of asthma, AIC reversed the established Th2 immune response [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484518"&gt;484518&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Airway hyper-reactivity and pulmonary eosinophilia following a challenge with complete ragweed pollen extract, in addition to Amb a 1-specific serum antibodies and in vitro cytokine production of spleen cells, were used as 'read-out systems'. Intradermal administration of AIC in saline reduced the airway hyper-reactivity more than unconjugated Amb a 1. In contrast to Amb a 1-treated animals, the numbers of eosinophils in lung lavage fluid decreased after treatment with AIC. AIC-induced Amb a 1-specific antibody and cytokine responses reflected the induction of a Th1-like immune response [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484518"&gt;484518&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from ragweed pollen-allergic individuals were stimulated with AIC [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="443398"&gt;443398&lt;/ulink&gt;]. AIC significantly reduced the synthesis of IL-4 and IL-5, yet enhanced IFNgamma production. An opposing cytokine profile, ie, high levels of IL-4 and IL-5 and low levels of IFNgamma induction, was observed when cells were stimulated with unconjugated Amb a 1 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="443398"&gt;443398&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar in vitro results were obtained with nasal biopsies from six ragweed pollen-allergic individuals [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="441272"&gt;441272&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Incubation of explanted nasal tissue with AIC for 24 h induced a pronounced reduction of mRNA expression for Th2-cytokines and an increase of IFNgamma mRNA compared with control. In contrast, stimulation with ragweed extract and Amb a 1 led to increased IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA-positive cells [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="441272"&gt;441272&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The capacity of AIC to bind IgE antibodies was tested in vitro using both IgE inhibition and histamine release assays. AIC binding to Amb a 1-specific IgE was weaker than IgE binding to unconjugated Amb a 1, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484516"&gt;484516&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Histamine release assays were performed with human basophils from four patients allergic to ragweed pollen. Achieving 40% histamine release in these cells required 2 x 10(-4) microg of unconjugated Amb a 1, or 1 x 10(-2) microg of AIC [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="356665"&gt;356665&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484516"&gt;484516&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;IL-10 secretion was monitored from PBMCs isolated from ragweed-allergic patients enrolled in a randomized trial of AIC involving a six-injection treatment regimen that ended approximately 2 weeks prior to ragweed season. PBMCs isolated from both AIC- or placebo-treated patients at various time points both pre- and post-ragweed season were stimulated ex vivo with Amb a 1 or tetanus toxoid. A sequential rise in IL-10 secretion from PBMCs isolated throughout the trial occurred in response to antigen stimulation, with a decline observed for the PBMCs isolated 3 months after the ragweed season. However, no difference between the AIC- and placebo-treated groups was observed, indicating that seasonal exposure to ragweed alone was responsible for the IL-10 production [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="485127"&gt;485127&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;No data are currently available. However, it is assumed that the vaccine is processed by the immune system and subsequently metabolized in the same manner as other antigens.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;In vitro and animal studies indicated that AIC has an improved safety profile compared with allergen extracts [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="478038"&gt;478038&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Allergenicity of AIC was determined in mast cell release studies, in murine models of anaphylaxis and the Arthus reaction. In mast cell degranulation studies, AIC was approximately 100-fold less allergenic than native allergen. Stepwise increases in the ODN conjugation ratio of ISS-ODN led to stepwise decreases in allergenicity, with only a modest reduction in immunogenicity. In anaphylaxis studies, death rates were reduced from 100% with native allergen challenge to as low as 0% with high-ratio ISS-ODN AIC challenge and similar results were obtained in an Arthus reaction model [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="478038"&gt;478038&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In a phase I trial evaluating safety, dose response and reactivity of AIC, six ragweed-allergic individuals were tested by intradermal endpoint titration for skin reactions to AIC compared with licensed ragweed extract [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="359633"&gt;359633&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Serial dilutions of both agents were applied to calculate an endpoint reaction sum of erythema value of 50 mm (D50). Compared with complete ragweed extract, 95- to 300-fold quantities of AIC were needed in order to achieve D50 skin reactions [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="356665"&gt;356665&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II/III&lt;/subtitle&gt;A phase II trial conducted in France involved 27 adults with seasonal rhinitis to ragweed pollen [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="402579"&gt;402579&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="404371"&gt;404371&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Of these individuals, 12 participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study and 15 were enrolled on an open-label study. AIC was administered subcutaneously at weekly intervals at three different dosing levels, ranging from 2.4 microg over a 3-week period to 15 microg over a 6-week period. The administration of AIC was well tolerated, with the exception of self-limited local reactions. After the relatively short-lasting treatment with AIC, allergen-specific serum IgG levels markedly increased by approximately 8-fold and were comparable to IgG levels after SIT with licensed ragweed extract [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="484636"&gt;484636&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In contrast, SIT with complete pollen extract is typically maintained for up to two years and involves approximately 60 allergen injections [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="402579"&gt;402579&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="409935"&gt;409935&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted at &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20596"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/ulink&gt;, Baltimore, USA and included 20 adult patients with a history of ragweed pollen allergy and positive skin puncture tests [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="404423"&gt;404423&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="412495"&gt;412495&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the first part of this study, patients received subcutaneous injections of AIC beginning with a 2.4 microg/injection at weekly intervals over 12 weeks. Injections were stopped prior to the ragweed pollen season to investigate the safety of AIC without overlapping with seasonal allergic symptoms. After the pollen season, the final maintenance dosage of 15 microg/injection of AIC was reached during the second part of the study. The pre-seasonal injections of AIC were well tolerated and none of the patients experienced adverse systemic reactions related to vaccination [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="412495"&gt;412495&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II/III&lt;/subtitle&gt;Two randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating phase II/III trials have evaluated the potential inflammatory responses in the nasal mucosa and the clinical efficacy of treatment with AIC [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="409935"&gt;409935&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The first trial, conducted at the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20596"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/ulink&gt; Medical School, included 40 individuals with a history of ragweed-induced allergy and positive puncture tests to ragweed allergens. The second study, conducted in Montreal, Canada, involved 60 ragweed pollen-allergic individuals. In both studies, a six-injection regimen was applied, with AIC administered subcutaneously at weekly intervals at three dosing levels ranging from 2.4 to 12 microg/injection. Nasal mucosal biopsies were taken 24 h post-nasal challenge, 3 weeks prior to, and 2 weeks after treatment to evaluate numbers of eosinophils and other inflammatory cells [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="409935"&gt;409935&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="443201"&gt;443201&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Results from the Canadian study have so far included data from 28 AIC-treated and 27 placebo-treated individuals [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="442183"&gt;442183&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Nasal challenges with ragweed pollen extract were performed 1 week before (baseline) and 2 weeks after treatment; frequency of sneezes and bilateral measurement of the nasal volume were recorded [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="441113"&gt;441113&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Compared with baseline levels, both the placebo- and AIC-treated groups responded less to nasal challenge with ragweed pollen extract after the immunotherapy period. No difference was reported between the two groups [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="442183"&gt;442183&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Serological and clinical results were presented for 25 (14 AIC- and 11 placebo-treated) individuals who were enrolled in the trial at &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20596"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/ulink&gt; Medical School [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="444184"&gt;444184&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In the sera of AIC-treated patients, Amb a 1-specific IgG increased from 226 IU/ml baseline levels to 519 IU/ml, while the sera Amb a 1-specific IgG levels of patients receiving placebo were 428 IU/ml at baseline level and 399 IU/ml after treatment. Baseline levels of Amb a 1-specific IgE in treated individuals were 101 IU/ml compared with 164 IU/ml after immunotherapy, while control individuals administered placebo displayed 85 IU/ml before and 58 IU/ml Amb a 1-specific IgE after the study. Patients were monitored during the ragweed season and patients' diary scores, medication usage, visual analog scale and Juniper quality-of-life assessments were evaluated [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="444184"&gt;444184&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Compared with placebo recipients, AIC-treated individuals experienced a significant improvement in visual hayfever score (p = 0.006) during the pollen season, in addition to improved diary scores. AIC recipients also experienced an enhanced rhinitis-specific quality-of-life (70 to 80% amelioration). One month post season, reduced eosinophils numbers and concentrations of IL-4 and IL-5, but increased IFNgamma, were detected in nasal biopsies of AIC-treated individuals compared with the placebo controls [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="467388"&gt;467388&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="472623"&gt;472623&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;Injections of AIC were generally well tolerated by patients and no severe vaccine-related adverse reactions were reported [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="404423"&gt;404423&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="444184"&gt;444184&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In some patients, dose adjustments due to systemic reactions to AIC proved necessary, but were equivalent in both AIC and placebo recipients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="444184"&gt;444184&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No evidence for the formation of anti-DNA antibodies was observed after treatment with AIC [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="404423"&gt;404423&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The induction of adverse Th1-mediated inflammation by DNA vaccines remains an issue of concern. The safety analysis of AIC in this respect depends on longer-term evaluation.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Data from preclinical and clinical phase I/II studies confirmed that the concept of conjugating an ISS-ODN to an allergen represents a promising approach to improve the specific therapy of allergic individuals. Unfortunately, the results of phase II/III trials revealed thus far are not illuminating. An increase of allergen-specific IgG titers provides evidence that the immunization was successful, but does not reflect the success of the immunotherapy. Increased allergen-specific IgG levels were also observed in non-responders. So far, only one trial included nasal provocation tests with ragweed pollen extract before and after AIC treatment, which represents an objective way to measure the success of the treatment; no difference between AIC- and placebo-treated individuals was found. In the other phase II/III trial, significant amelioration of the symptoms in AIC-treated individuals were reported, however, in this study the readout was exclusively based on subjective criteria (eg, diary scores and visual hayfever score). It is therefore difficult to judge the therapeutic utility of AIC at present. Nevertheless, especially taking into account that AIC was administered in a short-term six-injection regimen, AIC represents a promising novel vaccine for SIT of ragweed pollen-allergic patients.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="24774">Dynavax Technologies Corp</Company><Country id="CA">Canada</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="DX"
