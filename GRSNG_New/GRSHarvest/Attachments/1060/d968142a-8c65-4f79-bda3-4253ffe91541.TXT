Launch of the product was pending as of June 1999 [&lt;ulink linkID="329642" linkType="reference"&gt;329642&lt;/ulink&gt;], however, the vaccine had not been launched by April 2000, and a company spokesperson confirmed at this time that the product had been discontinued with no option for licensing [&lt;ulink linkID="370996" linkType="reference"&gt;370996&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;TGP-943 contains both pre-S2 and S portions of the envelope protein of hepatitis B virus [&lt;ulink linkID="161447" linkType="reference"&gt;161447&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In 1990, of previously unvaccinated volunteers, more than 50% vaccinated at  0, 1 and 6 months with TGP-943, tested positive for anti-pre-S2 antibodies by month one. Almost 100% tested positive for anti-HBs and anti-pre-S2 by the seventh month [&lt;ulink linkID="192284" linkType="reference"&gt;192284&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary></DevelopmentProfile><ExpertReview>&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Dr. Yuriy Kazachkov, Food and Drug Administration, &lt;/subtitle&gt;Rockville, MD, USA&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Currently used "conventional" recombinant hepatitis B vaccines are based on virus surface antigen (S protein, HBs antigen)  expressed in yeast. These vaccines are generally  effective, but do not induce a response in 5-10% of vaccinees. It was recently found that another portion of surface protein, pre-S2, is also essential for induction of neutralizing antibody and stimulation of cellular immune responses. TGP-943 is a modification of the existing vaccine technology in which a plasmid was constructed which provided expression of pre-S2-S protein in yeast (a sequence of hepatitis B virus subtype adr was used). Since this original protein was rapidly cleaved by yeast proteases, a deletion of 6 amino acid residues was introduced into the coding sequence to remove the sensitive site [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="215441"&gt;215441&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The resulting plasmid, pGLD P31-RcT, provided expression of M-P31c protein in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH22R. This protein was purified by means of chromatography and the purified product (two major forms of which were seen due to variations in glycosylation [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="119707"&gt;119707&lt;/ulink&gt;]) formed spherical particles. The vaccine was prepared by adsorption of this protein onto alum adjuvant [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="192280"&gt;192280&lt;/ulink&gt;]. TGP-943 induced an anti-S response similar to the conventional vaccines, and exhibited additional activities including early anti-pre-S2 response, a response in non-responders to conventional vaccines [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="161447"&gt;161447&lt;/ulink&gt;] and stimulation of T-cells and IL-2 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="91282"&gt;91282&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology and Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The pharmacology and metabolism of TGP-943 have not been studied in the manner used for other drugs (formally, vaccines are not "drugs", but "biologics"). Chemically, TGP-943 is not unique: it contains microgram amounts of protein-immunogen, and adjuvant (aluminum hydroxide gel) which was approved previously, independently of TGP-943. Biotransformation involves presentation of protein to the immune system; pre-S2 also induced T-cells and IL-2 in mice. Pre-S2 is a polyalbumin receptor, and induction of antibody to pre-S2 is believed to prevent infection of hepatocytes [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="91282"&gt;91282&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;TGP-943 was not toxic when administered subcutaneously (sc) or intramuscularly (im) (5-40 microg of protein per dose) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="161447"&gt;161447&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a phase I trial conducted in Japan, 128 healthy adult male volunteers with no history of previous hepatitis B vaccination and no evidence of hepatitis B virus infection were given 5, 10 or 20 microg of TGP-943 sc or im at 0, 1 and 6 months. The vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenically pure [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="161447"&gt;161447&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Phase II trials were carried out in seven medical departments in Japan in which 436 healthy adults with no evidence of hepatitis B infection were vaccinated with TGP-943. Of these, 418 volunteers were without previous hepatitis B vaccination, and 18 were non-responders to conventional hepatitis B vaccine. The optimal dose of TGP-943, inter-lot reproducibility, efficacy in non-responders and side-effects were studied. Doses of 20 microg im, given at months 0, 1 and 6, were more immunogenic than others. Seroconversion was seen in 96-100% of vaccinees, including non-responders. Side-effects were minor and were more frequent at 40 microg/dose [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="161447"&gt;161447&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Immunogenicity and side effects of TGP-943 were studied in 1534 volunteers, including children, at 19 medical and 13 pediatric departments in Japan. Of these, 244 volunteers were non-responders to conventional hepatitis B vaccines. Doses of 10 or 20 microg/dose were given sc or im at 0, 1 and 6 months. Seroconversion was once again high, 94-100% seroconverted, 80-92% in the non-responder group. Anti-pre-S2 antibody appeared earlier than anti-HBs: more than half the group became positive for anti-pre-S2 at month 1, compared to 10% for anti-HBs. Side-effects were minor [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="161447"&gt;161447&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side effects and contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Minor systemic or local reactions at the site of administration were seen in 10% (or less in the case of im administration) of recipients at 10-20 microg/dose; reactions persisted longer than 6 days in 0.17% of recipients. These reactions were transient and did not require medical treatment. The occurrence of side effects was slightly higher in the group receiving 40 microg/dose, and after sc injections compared to im ones [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="161447"&gt;161447&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No contraindications specific for TGP-943 were reported.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;EVALUATOR?S OPINION&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;TGP-943 appears to be a safe and effective vaccine against hepatitis B virus infection. Advantages over previous generation vaccines include early anti-pre-S2 response (before anti-S response), and induction of anti-S and anti-pre-S2 antibody in individuals who do not respond to conventional vaccines.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The development of analogous recombinant vaccines, including hepatitis B virus pre-S sequences, has been reported. These vaccines utilize different subtypes of the hepatitis B virus and mammalian cell culture expression system for production of recombinant protein [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="215442"&gt;215442&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="215443"&gt;215443&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="215444"&gt;215444&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The mammalian system is believed to provide more adequate glycosylation of the expressed proteins, but is more expensive and less developed than the yeast system used in TGP-943.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="20300">Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd</Company><Country id="JP">Japan</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="DX" sortOrder="4">Discontinued</DevelopmentStatus><DiscontinuedReason id="4">Not Reported</DiscontinuedReason><Indication id="152">Hepatitis B virus infection</Indication><StatusDate>2000-05-01T00:00:00.000Z</StatusDate><Source id="370996" type="CORPORATE"/></DevelopmentStatusCurrent><DevelopmentStatusHistoric><Company id="20300">Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd</Company><Country id="JP">Japan</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="R" sortOrder="14">Registered</DevelopmentStatus><Indication id="152">Hepatitis B virus infection</Indication><StatusDate>1999-06-29T00:00:00.000Z</StatusDate><Source id="329642" type="CORPORATE"/></DevelopmentStatusHistoric><DevelopmentStatusHistoric><Company id="20300">Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd</Company><Country id="JP">Japan</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="PR" sortOrder="13">Pre-registration</DevelopmentStatus><Indication id="152">Hepatitis B virus infection</Indication></DevelopmentStatusHistoric><DevelopmentStatusHistoric><Company id="20300">Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd</Company><Country id="JP">Japan</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="C3" sortOrder="12">Phase 3 Clinical</DevelopmentStatus><Indication id="152">Hepatitis B virus infection</Indication></DevelopmentStatusHistoric></IDdbDevelopmentStatus><ReasonsForUpdate><ReasonForUpdate><Reason>Development Status Updated</Reason><Description>One or more development status entries have been updated</Description></ReasonForUpdate></ReasonsForUpdate><hasSWOTs>N</hasSWOTs></drugRecordOutput>
