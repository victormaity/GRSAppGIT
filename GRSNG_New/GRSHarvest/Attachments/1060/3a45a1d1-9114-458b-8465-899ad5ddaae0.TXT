The study aimed to evaluate the change in motor function from baseline to one year on study, using the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS). Safety analysis was to be performed by an independent safety monitoring committee after the first groups of 12 and 32 patients have been treated. Patients were to be randomized to receive Spheramine treatment or sham surgery and were to be evaluated regularly for safety and efficacy [&lt;ulink linkID="474564" linkType="reference"&gt;474564&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By June 2003, this trial was expected to be completed in 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="494770" linkType="reference"&gt;494770&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By November 2003, enrollment of the first cohort of 12 patients had been completed [&lt;ulink linkID="513339" linkType="reference"&gt;513339&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By May 2004, half of the required number of patients had been enrolled and the trial was expected to be completed in the second half of 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="537041" linkType="reference"&gt;537041&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By November 2004, an independent safety monitoring committee  recommended that the trial should continue.  Titan expected to complete the study in early 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="569823" linkType="Reference"&gt;569823&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2005, Titan was enrolling a third, final cohort of 32 patients and expected to complete the study in the second half of 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="589529" linkType="Reference"&gt;589529&lt;/ulink&gt;].

By May 2007, 67 patients had been recruited; at that time, Titan expected to report results in the second half of 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="792383" linkType="Reference"&gt;792383&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2007, enrollment was completed, with 71 patients recruited  [&lt;ulink linkID="809658" linkType="Reference"&gt;809658&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2007, results from the trial were expected in the third quarter of 2008  [&lt;ulink linkID="849377" linkType="Reference"&gt;849377&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July  2008, data were reported showing the drug had failed to meet its primary and secondary endpoint. No significant differences were found between the Spheramine and sham surgery arms of the study after 1 year. At that time,  Titan  planned to continue to analyze the data to determine their next step [&lt;ulink linkID="922045" linkType="Reference"&gt;922045&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2003, results from a phase I/II trial at 24 months post-treatment were presented at the 55th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, held in Honolulu, HI. In the trial Spheramine (325,000 hRPE cells) was administered to patients (n = 6) with late stage PD  (Hoehn &amp;amp; Yahr Stage III &amp;amp; IV) by unilateral implantation into the most affected side of the brain.  The data supported previous results with an average 41% improvement in motor UPDRS score across patients off their usual medication, a 48% improvement across  those receiving other Medications and a 39% improvement in quality of life  [&lt;ulink linkID="484439" linkType="reference"&gt;484439&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="508515" linkType="reference"&gt;508515&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Treatment of the first cohort of patients in this study began in January 2001 and by March 2001, enrollment had been completed [&lt;ulink linkID="396932" linkType="reference"&gt;396932&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="402747" linkType="reference"&gt;402747&lt;/ulink&gt;].

At 12 months post-treatment, patients experienced an average 43% improvement in total UPDRS score, and an average 48% improvement in motor UPDRS score, in the absence of other medications. Half of the six patients involved in the trial demonstrated a reduction in pre-existing dyskinesias and no safety concerns were reported [&lt;ulink linkID="448443" linkType="reference"&gt;448443&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were presented in May 2001,  at the American Academy of Neurology meeting, Philadelphia, PA. The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was the motor score of the total UPDRS, which is evaluated at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-treatment. All patients demonstrated an improvement, with no safety concerns or significant adverse events. At 3 months post-treatment, an average 30% improvement over baseline was demonstrated in the total UPDRS scores, and an average 35% improvement was demonstrated in motor UPDRS scores, in the absence of other medications. An evaluation of the first patient, 12 months post-treatment, demonstrated a 36% improvement over baseline total UPDRS, and a 48% improvement over baseline motor UPDRS, in the absence of other medication [&lt;ulink linkID="408522" linkType="reference"&gt;408522&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2001, additional results from an ongoing, phase I/II, open-label, six-patient study with Spheramine were presented at the International Congress on PD in Helsinki, Finland. The data showed  all patients experienced a clinical  improvement and no safety concerns or significant adverse events were noted. At  6 months post-treatment, an average 33% improvement over baseline was demonstrated in total UPDRS scores and an average 34% improvement was demonstrated in motor UPDRS scores, in the absence of other medications. At 9 months post-treatment, an average 40% improvement over baseline was demonstrated in total UPDRS scores and an average 38% improvement was demonstrated in motor UPDRS scores, off all other medications. One patient had completed 15 months on the study and evaluation at that time demonstrated a 42% improvement over baseline total UPDRS and a 43% improvement over baseline motor UPDRS, off other medications [&lt;ulink linkID="417491" linkType="reference"&gt;417491&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2003, Schering reported data from the pilot open-label study which had enrolled six patients who received a fixed dose of Spheramine by five unilateral implants of approximately 65,000 cells. No immunosuppression was observed during the study. During the 12-month trial and 12-month follow-up period, no off state dyskinesias were observed, nor were any serious Spheramine-related adverse events.  Patients were evaluated using the UPDRS and showed an improvement of about 33% at 6 months post-treatment, which increased to approximately 48% at 12 months [&lt;ulink linkID="494770" linkType="reference"&gt;494770&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2008, 4-year data from the trial were presented at the 76th Annual Meeting of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons in Chicago, IL. Improvement at 4 years averaged 44% [&lt;ulink linkID="900475" linkType="Reference"&gt;900475&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that all the implants were localized in the striatum with characteristic features including edema, focal hemorrhage and inflammation, which was resolved by 5 months, although macrophage and microglial activation was still observed. Hypertrophy of astrocytes was observed at the 48 h and 1 month, and some was persistent until 5 months, although the majority was no longer present at that time. ED-1 positive immunoreactivity was observed, and reached its maximum at 1 month, after which a decline appeared to occur. RPE65 positive staining was observed at 5 months post-implant [&lt;ulink linkID="733266" linkType="Reference"&gt;733266&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2002, preclinical data on Spheramine were presented at the 8th International Conference on Neural Transplantation and Repair in Keystone, CO, showing an increased dopaminergic signal in brain regions treated with Spheramine, supporting the mechanism of action of Spheramine through the validated approach of enhancing local dopamine production in the CNS [&lt;ulink linkID="508714" linkType="reference"&gt;508714&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Microcarriers are microscopic beads for direct implantation into the CNS, the surfaces of which are coated with live cells that secrete therapeutic factors useful in the treatment of certain neurological diseases. The beads provide a matrix to which cells attach and grow, increasing the survival and successful engraftment of the cells [&lt;ulink linkID="259814" linkType="reference"&gt;259814&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Spheramine is delivered by stereotaxic injection to the brain, providing dopamine to specific sites that are dopamine-deficient [&lt;ulink linkID="275338" linkType="reference"&gt;275338&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Pilot study results on a rhesus monkey model revealed that Spheramine restored function in animals that had severe movement impairments. Marked improvement was also shown using a standard scale for the measurement of PD. Improvement was rapidly achieved and maintained after a single treatment. No immunosuppression was required. Efficacy was undiminished at the end of the 8-month study, indicating the potential for continued efficacy for substantially longer periods [&lt;ulink linkID="275338" linkType="reference"&gt;275338&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="285464" linkType="reference"&gt;285464&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Studies of 25 non-human primates treated with up to 443,000 hRPE cells on microcarriers for 6 to 16 months showed no adverse behavioral or histological effects. Furthermore, 12 month efficacy was shown in an MPTP PD model in primates [&lt;ulink linkID="494770" linkType="reference"&gt;494770&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 1999, Titan reported positive efficacy results (3-month interim analysis) with Spheramine in expanded studies using a validated primate model of PD. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in PD-like symptoms in Spheramine treated animals versus controls, in blinded evaluation using a standard, modified PD rating scale. Improvement was rapidly achieved and maintained after a single treatment with Spheramine.

By March 2006, Titan  had transferred the IND  to Schering, which had assumed additional responsibilities for the  Spheramine  program [&lt;ulink linkID="655384" linkType="Reference"&gt;655384&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 1999, Titan was awarded Phase I of a combined Phase I/II Fast Track SBIR grant, to support the development of Spheramine, by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The Phase I grant totaled $120,000 [&lt;ulink linkID="342632" linkType="reference"&gt;342632&lt;/ulink&gt;].

PD is inherited in a small proportion of patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="597117"&gt;597117&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="598431"&gt;598431&lt;/ulink&gt;], and first-degree relatives of affected people have twice the risk of developing PD compared with the general population [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="599888"&gt;599888&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in the remaining 95% of patients there is no genetic linkage and the cause of the disease remains unknown. Etiological theories of environmental factors (such as pesticides, well water and infectious agents) are largely based on case reports and are not supported by evidence from population-based prospective studies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="597117"&gt;597117&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, interest in neurotoxins was stimulated in 1983 when a chemical found in illicit drug use, N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), was shown to cause pathologic and clinical features indistinguishable from PD as a result of the selective destruction of cells in the substantia nigra [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="410565"&gt;410565&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which project to the basal ganglia, is central to the underlying pathophysiology of PD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="598431"&gt;598431&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The resulting depletion of striatal dopamine is believed to be responsible for the major clinical symptoms associated with this disorder, which include parkinsonism. This syndrome is characterized by a tremor at rest, along with rigidity, slowness or absence of voluntary movement, postural instability and the inability to initiate movements. The replenishment of striatal dopamine, via administration of the dopamine precursor levodopa, alleviates the majority of these symptoms. Hence levodopa, has long been central to the pharmaceutical standard of care [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="597147"&gt;597147&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="598431"&gt;598431&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, long-term treatment with the dopamine precursor is associated with the development of dyskinesias (movement disorders) in most patients, which are difficult to control and often debilitating [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="598431"&gt;598431&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Levodopa is normally administered in combination with other agents, which either reduce the peripheral metabolism of levodopa, such as DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (eg, carbidopa) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="597118"&gt;597118&lt;/ulink&gt;], or that inhibit the metabolism of dopamine in the CNS, such as monoamine oxidase B inhibitors (eg, selegiline) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="597120"&gt;597120&lt;/ulink&gt;], or catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitors (eg, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="6556"&gt;entacapone&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="598431"&gt;598431&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A number of directly acting dopamine agonists that penetrate the CNS (eg, bromcriptine, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4151"&gt;pramipexole&lt;/ulink&gt;, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="4908"&gt;ropinirole&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2705"&gt;cabergoline&lt;/ulink&gt;) have also been used therapeutically [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="455572"&gt;455572&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These treatments for PD relieve the symptoms (bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor) to a greater or lesser degree, but none are proven to alter disease progression [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="597118"&gt;597118&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="598431"&gt;598431&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Cell therapy techniques offer hope of halting progression (neuroprotection) or even reversing the disease process (neuroregeneration). In advanced PD, currently available treatments become less effective, efficacious doses are limited by the adverse effects (such as involuntary movements, hallucinations and confusion) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="597118"&gt;597118&lt;/ulink&gt;], and the clinical response becomes unpredictable with the 'on/off' effect, which features alternating periods between being mobile and able to function ('on') and being slow, stiff and immobile ('off') [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="597118"&gt;597118&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Approaches to treating to PD include the disease-modifying therapy glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7271"&gt;liatermine&lt;/ulink&gt;) that has undergone clinical evaluation by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="14109"&gt;Amgen Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;. In an open-label clinical trial, intraputaminal catheter implantation delivering continuous GDNF by infusion contralaterally to the more affected side was associated with a Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) improvement of 30% at 24 weeks. The only adverse event was transient Lhermitte's symptom in two patients [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="595439"&gt;595439&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A further two-year phase I trial of continuous GDNF infusion into the posterior putamen showed no serious adverse effects and no serious detrimental effects on cognition [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="595440"&gt;595440&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients had a 57% improvement in 'off' motor activities and a 63% improvement in activities of daily living subscores in UPDRS. However, &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="14109"&gt;Amgen&lt;/ulink&gt; discontinued development of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7271"&gt;liatermine&lt;/ulink&gt; following its failure to meet efficacy endpoints in further clinical studies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="546620"&gt;546620&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Cell therapy is an alternative new approach to PD therapy and may provide better long-term clinical control than GDNF or currently available therapies [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;]. It was previously hoped that fetal cell transplantation would offer a major advance in the treatment of PD. Indeed, a fetal human dopamine cell transplant therapy is currently under clinical evaluation by the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20518"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="346478"&gt;346478&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, there are problems including ethical issues and difficulty in obtaining sufficient tissue [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="599229"&gt;599229&lt;/ulink&gt;]. An additional problem with cell therapy has been low cellular survival rates, which has been attributed to destruction of the cells by the host immune system [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Alternative cell therapy approaches were developed and tested, which included the use of adrenal chromaffin and Sertoli cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="226810"&gt;226810&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555755"&gt;555755&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Chromaffin cells were investigated because of their capacity to produce catecholamines and transform into a neuronal phenotype [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555755"&gt;555755&lt;/ulink&gt;], while Sertoli cells obtained from testes were viable as they can be grafted into the brain of a different species without the need for long-term immunosuppression [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="226810"&gt;226810&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Spheramine is a novel cell therapy currently under development by &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20377"&gt;Titan Pharmaceuticals Inc&lt;/ulink&gt; (formerly &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="22523"&gt;Theracell Inc&lt;/ulink&gt;) and &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19687"&gt;Schering AG&lt;/ulink&gt;, which is designed to replace depleted dopamine in the basal ganglia. It consists of human retinal pigmented epithelial cells (hRPE) that secrete dopamine. These cells are attached to microcarriers, which promote cell survival and protect the cells from an immune response [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555755"&gt;555755&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555758"&gt;555758&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Spheramine is injected into the brain using stereotactic surgery. It is a permanent implant and cannot be removed. It has been tested in experimental models and is well tolerated with minimal host immune response. Early open-label results from six patients with advanced PD are promising [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The main concerns regarding cell therapies are the ability to obtain adequate supplies of tissue, ethical issues of sourcing cells, and long-term cell viability. Once implanted, the cells cannot be removed and long-term effects are not known. If cell regeneration or dopamine production becomes overactive there may be irreversible dopamine excess, possibly resulting in dyskinesia, hallucinations and confusion. The risks of such surgical procedures also need to be considered; although in the small number of patients who have undergone this procedure to date there have been no significant adverse effects.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Spheramine is composed of cultured hRPE cells on ~ 100 microm crosslinked porcine gelatin microcarriers [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;]. hRPE cells were identified as potentially useful in the treatment of PD as they were known to contain enzymes involved in the production of dopamine. These cells produce levodopa, express D2 dopamine receptors and secrete dopamine and numerous growth factors. The cells used to obtain the hRPE in Spheramine were originally derived from an infant who died shortly after birth. Hence, the cells are mature and fully differentiated rather than embryonic or stem cells, which can migrate and change after implantation. Furthermore, these cells can be produced in large numbers in cell culture from a single starting sample (overcoming the issue of insufficient tissue availability) allowing standardization for therapeutic use. Tissue samples are now obtained from postmortem human eye and are examined to ensure they are free from hepatitis B and C, toxoplasma, herpes simplex-1 and -2, HIV-1 and -2, HTLV-1 and -2, Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia trachomatis and cytomegalovirus. The cells can be frozen prior to use. Another major problem in cell transplantation is cellular survival due to host rejection. Microcarrier gelatin beads, which provide a matrix to which cells attach and grow, have traditionally been used in vitro to enhance cell survival in culture. The cell-coated microcarrier (CCM) gelatin bead component of Spheramine, prepared from porcine gelatin, increases the long-term viability of the graft and has meant that immunosuppression is not required in cell transplantation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555755"&gt;555755&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555758"&gt;555758&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Preclinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;Preclinical studies have shown that the transplantation of dopamine secreting chromaffin cells is effective in replacing dopamine that has been lost after lesions to the substantia nigra and disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway. Unfortunately, the usefulness of this method is limited because of problems with long-term chromaffin cell viability and the need for immunosuppression. Studies using polymer-encapsulated dopamine-secreting cells or micocarrier beads (eg, Spheramine) demonstrate that dopamine secretion is prolonged and rejection is prevented [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555755"&gt;555755&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555757"&gt;555757&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555758"&gt;555758&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555769"&gt;555769&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microcarrier bead delivery systems enhance graft survival without immunosuppression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a 3-month study, human and rat fetal ventral mesencephalic neurons transplanted into rat striatum survived well with no systemic immunosuppression if attached to microcarriers, but did not survive without immunosuppression if transplanted alone [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555758"&gt;555758&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Survival of ventral mesencephalic cells was evaluated by the quantification of discernable tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells around the periphery of the graft sites (as the graft site itself was too intensely immunoreactive to discern individual neurons). These TH-positive cells were only detected in 16% of animals in which lone human neurons were transplanted, whereas TH-positive cells were detected in 75% of rats receiving human cells absorbed onto microcarriers (p = 0.021). In rats that were transplanted with rat ventral mesencephalic neurons, TH-positive cells were detected in 56% of rats receiving lone transplantation, compared with 84% receiving rat cells on microcarriers (p = 0.0045) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555758"&gt;555758&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Adrenal chromaffin cells attached to microcarrier beads implanted into the striatal parenchyma (but not the ventricle) of rat brains, with unilateral lesions of the substantia nigra, are viable for at least 8 months [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555757"&gt;555757&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555769"&gt;555769&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Histological examination, in which TH-positive cells were detected, showed the cells were still present at the end of this period without the need for immunosuppression. Rats display apomorphine-induced rotations (AIR) if there is a functional dopaminergic asymmetry between the right and left striata, hence untreated unilaterally lesioned rats show the highest number of AIR. Consistent with this, rats implanted with cells attached to microcarriers displayed reduced AIR, with a control (no transplant) mean of 10.9 +/- 1.4 to 3.6 +/- 1.1 turns/min without any 'drop-off' in effect in rats transplanted with the cells attached to microcarriers. In rats in which only the cells were transplanted, there was also a reduction in the number of AIR, however, this effect was transient and lasted &amp;lt; 3 months [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555757"&gt;555757&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555769"&gt;555769&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The viability of attaching hRPE cells to gelatin microcarrier cells (10,000 hRPE cells with 150 beads) was also assessed in rats [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555766"&gt;555766&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="599474"&gt;599474&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In one such study, rats were injected with hRPE attached to microcarriers or hRPE alone, alongside further control treatments. Pathology examination of the brain tissue revealed that hRPE cells only survived at the end of the 12- to 18-week study period when attached to microcarrier beads. Furthermore, Spheramine displayed greater efficacy over a 12-week study period in decreasing AIR than the lone administration of hRPE cells. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spheramine reverses motor symptoms of parkinsonism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a study of adult Sprague Dawley rats (n = 34), hemiparkinson's was induced via unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the mesostriatal pathway. Following recovery, animals received one of four treatments directed into the lesion: (i) ~ 1000 hRPE cells attached to ~ 150 microcarriers (Spheramine), (ii) ~ 1000 hRPE cells, (iii) ~ 150 microcarriers, and (iv) needle tract alone [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555766"&gt;555766&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Functional recovery in the denervated striatum was assessed by the induction of AIR. All groups showed significant reduction in AIR scores at 4 and 8 weeks compared with baseline. However, thereafter only the Spheramine-treated rats continued to exhibit reduced AIR scores at 12 and 18 weeks (p = 0.001), while the others showed a gradual return to baseline scores. At 12 weeks, AIR scores were ~ 7.5, 9, 9 and 10 rotations/min in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. At 18 weeks, AIR scores were ~ 7, 9 and 11 rotations/min in treatment groups 1, 2 and 4, respectively (p = 0.02; no data were given for group 3). Histological examination of brain tissue showed that host immune response was minimal. On the basis of this data, the investigators concluded that Spheramine implantation may be well tolerated in mammals, and may potentially provide therapeutic benefit in PD [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555766"&gt;555766&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a rhesus monkey model, a single injection of Spheramine restored motor function (an improvement in the range of 50 to 70% using a standard scale for assessment of PD severity) and this response was sustained during an 8-month follow-up period without the need for immunosuppression [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="285464"&gt;285464&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The study specifically reported improvements in feeding and climbing behavior. Positive Emission Tomography (PET) provided brain-imaging evidence that the cells continued to produce dopamine after transplantation and survived until the end of the study period [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="285464"&gt;285464&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A blinded placebo-controlled trial in rhesus monkeys was performed to evaluate the effect of striatally delivered Spheramine in rhesus monkeys with MPTP-induced parkinsonism [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="334505"&gt;334505&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555765"&gt;555765&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="599683"&gt;599683&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="599685"&gt;599685&lt;/ulink&gt;]. MPTP injections were made through the left internal carotid artery, and were repeated as necessary to achieve stable impairment according to a modified UPDRS (mUPDRS). Monkeys received one of four treatments delivered to two sites in the caudate nucleus and three sites in the putamen: (i) ~ 12,120 hRPE cells on microcarriers (total dose ~ 60,000 cells); (ii) ~ 56,600 hRPE cells on microcarriers (total dose ~ 280,000 cells); (iii) needle tract alone; or (iv) microcarriers alone. Clinical symptoms were evaluated according to mUPDRS at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. There were notable improvements mUPDRS scores in monkeys receiving the highest dose that were sustained throughout the study period, compared with the sham control (p &amp;lt; 0.05). However, no significant improvement was seen across any of the other treatment groups. Hence, the trial revealed rapid and sustained improvement without the need for immunosuppression [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A more recent study in primates employed PET imaging to visualize hRPE cells and their effect in vivo [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="599046"&gt;599046&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In this study, cynomolgus (n = 7) and rhesus monkeys (n = 3) with MPTP-induced parkinsonism received Spheramine (60,000 to 10,000 cells) injections into the posterior putamen. Prior to transplantation, monkeys displayed characteristic symptoms of parkinsonism and each animal was given a clinical rating to assess the severity of its symptoms. At 6- to 8-weeks post-Spheramine implant, there was an average improvement in clinical rating of 38% (p = 0.008). There were numerous behavioral improvements that were observed following implantation, including the amount and range of daily activities (particularly in grooming and foraging), bradykinesia, balance, coordination and return of facial expression. However, there were no such improvements in tremor, which remained prominent over the 2-month study period. PET imaging revealed a significant (p = 0.02) increase in accumulation of FDOPA (quantified using the striatum/cortex ratio or R(s/c) value), a marker for dopaminergic presynaptic activity, in the implanted putamen (pre-implant value of 1.35; post-implant value of 1.48) compared with the contralateral putamen (pre-implant and post-implant values of 1.31). This change was accompanied by a significant (p = 0.006) reduction in binding of the selective D2/3 receptor ligand &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="13534"&gt;raclopride&lt;/ulink&gt; (quantified using the distribution volume ratio-1) to postsynaptic receptors in the implanted putamen (pre-implant value of 2.41; post-implant value of 2.44) compared with the contralateral putamen (pre-implant value of 2.40; post-implant value of 2.68). The same markers were also evaluated in the caudate nucleus where there were no changes detected, indicating that the effects of the implant are regionally restricted. Hence, this study provided direct evidence that the beneficial effects of Spheramine are indeed mediated via a dopaminergic mechanism, and predominantly through increased dopamine release [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="599046"&gt;599046&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics&lt;/subtitle&gt;It is difficult to ascertain the fate of cells after implantation. In animal studies, 18 weeks after implantation, examination of brain tissue found the microcarriers unchanged and cells resembling RPE cells [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555766"&gt;555766&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In human studies, clinical improvement has been sustained for at least two years [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="484439"&gt;484439&lt;/ulink&gt;] providing an indication of cell survival and continued dopamine production.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;There are no published reports of any serious adverse events occurring in any of the animal studies. Histological examination of rats in which microcarrier beads were transplanted into the corpus striatum revealed no signs of an inflammatory response at 14-days post-transplantation [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555757"&gt;555757&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A similar study in rats also revealed minimal host immune response to Spheramine (~ 1000 hRPE cells attached to ~ 150 microcarriers) at 18-weeks post-treatment [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555766"&gt;555766&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The tolerability of Spheramine (80,000 hRPE cells coupled with 2.4 mg gelatin microcarriers or 50,000 hRPE cells coupled with 1.5 mg gelatin microcarriers per injection site) was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys (n = 32) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555770"&gt;555770&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Spheramine was intracranially injected into the left forebrain of the animals at five sites, and at four depths per site. At 6 or 16 months following dosing, there were no treatment-related fatalities or signs of toxicity; including no changes in body weight, organ weight, hematology or clinical chemistry parameters, gross pathology or histopathology. There was also no evidence of migration or replication of the cells in situ. The only route-related effects reported were chronic glial fibrosis and minimal granuloma formation. These effects were evident at 6 months but had largely been resolved by 16 months. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for Spheramine was estimated to be &amp;gt; 400,000 hRPE cells coupled with 13 mg gelatin microcarriers, while for lone administration of the microcarriers the MTD was estimated to be &amp;gt; 13 mg [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555770"&gt;555770&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I/II&lt;/subtitle&gt;An open-label study of patients (n = 6) with advanced PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages III to IV) was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Spheramine [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555773"&gt;555773&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients received unilateral implants of Spheramine (~ 325,000 cells) during MRI-guided surgery into five tracts at 5 mm apart in the post-commissural putamen of the most affected side of the brain. Initial assessments were performed at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and revealed that Spheramine treatment improved UPDRS motor score by 28, 35, 34, 43 and 48%, respectively, while patients were off other PD medications [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At 9-months post-implantation, there were also improvements noted in secondary measures of efficacy including the total UPDRS (40%), Timed Motor Tests (on, 16%; off, 35%), PDQ39 QOL (38%) and Schwab and England Physician Rated ADL (on, 11%; off, 34%). At this time, there was also a bilateral improvement in motor symptoms with particular improvement shown contralaterally to the implants [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At two-years post-implantation, there was a 41% improvement in motor UPDRS while off other PD medications, and a 48% improvement in UPDRS while on other PD medications. These clinical improvements were accompanied by a 39% overall improvement in quality of life. In addition, half the patients exhibited a reduction in pre-existing dyskinesia and none of the patients had dyskinesia while off PD medication overnight. Spheramine was well tolerated and there were no safety concerns [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508515"&gt;508515&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="555773"&gt;555773&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase IIb&lt;/subtitle&gt;A trial is currently underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Spheramine implantation in advanced PD patients (n = 68) (www.clinicaltrials.gov), [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="474564"&gt;474564&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="537041"&gt;537041&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This double-blind trial is designed to randomize patients to either bilateral implantation of Spheramine into the postcommissural putamen or sham surgery. The primary endpoint is a change in motor function from baseline. Evaluation of clinical outcome will be scheduled at regular intervals for the first two years, and annually thereafter for at least five years post-implantation. Data from this trial have not yet been released (www.clinicaltrials.gov), [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="474564"&gt;474564&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="537041"&gt;537041&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;No serious side effects have been reported. Spheramine and the accompanying surgery were well tolerated in a phase I/II pilot study in PD patients, and a normal post-operative healing process was evident during the follow-up period. However, in one patient a small intra-operative hemorrhage occurred laterally to a single implant tract, although there was no resultant mass effect or neurological deficit noted [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="508513"&gt;508513&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Patent Summary&lt;/subtitle&gt;Theracell published a patent application WO-09934834 entitled 'Use of pigmented retinal epithelial cells for creation of an immune privilege site' in July 1999. This application describes a method whereby a local immunosuppressive environment can be established in tissue via the implantation of hPRE cells. Once transplanted, these cells can be used to produce therapeutic proteins or other molecules to provide therapeutic benefit within the localized region. The application discloses that hRPE cells secrete the immunosuppressive cytokine Fas L, in addition to growth factor and hormones, and hence may be suitable for use in the treatment in a variety of chronic diseases. An earlier and more general patent application WO-09206702, assigned to &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20646"&gt;New York University&lt;/ulink&gt;, was published in 1992 and relates to methods for transplanting cells into the brain and their potential clinical usage. The patent application describes a method for grafting cells into the brain via attachment to a support matrix such as glass or plastic microcarrier beads with diameters of between 90 and 125 microm. The use of cell lines, neural or paraneural cells, such as chromaffin cells, in this context are claimed for the treatment of neurological disorders such as PD, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;The available evidence shows some encouragement for the use of cell therapy in PD. However, clinical studies reported so far include only small numbers of participants and are mostly open label. As both patients and doctors understandably want this therapy to be a major breakthrough, the placebo response is expected to be significant. Placebo responses are well documented in PD; in a study where a positive response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in UPDRS motor score, or an improvement of at least two points in at least two items, 16% of cases receiving placebo showed a positive response [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="595436"&gt;595436&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Other cell therapies for PD in clinical development include a neural stem therapy (Calmed Biosciences Inc) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="416608"&gt;416608&lt;/ulink&gt;] and a fetal human dopamine cell transplant therapy (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20518"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/ulink&gt;; NIH) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="346478"&gt;346478&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Studies with the NIH fetal mesencephalic cell implantation although initially successful, were disappointing in the long term due to the occurrence of involuntary movements, which many patients found more disabling than their parkinsonism. This problem was irreversible as the implanted cells are generally considered to be inaccessible for later surgical removal after initial placement [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="595443"&gt;595443&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Spheramine administered as a single injection poses less associated procedural problems than the continuous catheter delivery of GDNF. In a study of ten patients in Kentucky receiving GDNF, all ten experienced discomfort from the pump and headaches the day after surgery, while one patient required a catheter replacement [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="595439"&gt;595439&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Spheramine works by implanting dopamine producing cells, whereas GDNF is a neurotrophic factor which prevents further neuronal loss and may even regenerate some of the damaged neurons. Inherently, the potential of GDNF to preserve and repair neurons seems to be more 'curative' than a more sophisticated form of dopamine replacement therapy (Spheramine), but it is too early to make any definite judgement as to whether or not Spheramine will prove a more effective therapy than GDNF. Furthermore, different approaches to the treatment of PD may be more appropriate according to differing subtypes of parkinsonism (eg, idiopathic PD versus the Parkinson Plus syndromes). It would be interesting to evaluate Spheramine in different subgroups of patients, as efficacy may be greater in certain groups of patients.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The first patients treated with Spheramine now have four to five years of follow-up and there remain no serious safety concerns. However, as PD has only a marginal effect on life expectancy, it is too early to rule out adverse effects in the longer term. It is also unknown whether the microcarrier system could have longer-term adverse effects. The main issues regarding efficacy are whether the implanted cells will maintain viability over the entire course of the disease, and avoid either excess dopamine production with the associated dyskinesias, or underproduction of dopamine which might necessitate repeat procedures. Longer-term clinical studies are required to remedy these concerns.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="19687">Bayer Schering Pharma
