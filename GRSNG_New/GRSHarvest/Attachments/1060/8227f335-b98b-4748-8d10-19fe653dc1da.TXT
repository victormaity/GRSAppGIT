Odanacatib selectively and potently inhibits cathepsin K (CatK), the primary catalyst of bone resorption. Since CatK is the enzyme responsible for bone matrix degradation it is possible to use bone resorption biomarkers to quantify pharmacodynamic effects in short term clinical studies. CatK cleaves the N-telopeptide of collagen type I to form NTx and also cleaves the serum C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (1-CTP - itself generated by the action of matrix metalloproteases) to generate CTx.

The primary hypotheses for the study are that a single-dose of odanacatib is well tolerated in mature adolescents and following single dose administration of odanacatib 50 mg, there is no clinically important difference in AUC0 to inf between mature adolescents and young adults.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Main objective of the trial is to  assess the safety and abilty for the body to tolerate a single dose of the study drug, odanacatib in 12 to 25 year olds. This study is also aims to look at the levels of certain parameters that are associated with how the study drug acts in the body (pharmacokinetic parameters). The levels of these parameters will be measured in the blood following a single oral dose of the study drug.

drug, odanacatib, on the levels of a chemical marker of the break down of bone structure (bone resorption) in the urine of in mature adolescents receiving glucocorticoids, evaluate the relationships between what the human body does to the study drug and what the study drug does to the human body by assesing the concentration and inhibition of the chemical marker of the break down of bone structure (bone resorption) and use the data generated by this study to predict an appropriate dose in mature adolescents if neither 10 nor 50 mg demonstrates similarity of total amount of drug
