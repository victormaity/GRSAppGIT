By June 2013, enrollment was expected to be completed by the end of first quarter of 2014 and at that time, the company completed meetings with Health Canada for submission of  clinical trial application (CTA) in Canada to initiate phase IIb trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1462998" linkType="Reference"&gt;1462998&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2013, the CTA was approved by Health Canada to initiate the phase IIb trial in Canada [&lt;ulink linkID="1477510" linkType="Reference"&gt;1477510&lt;/ulink&gt;]; by December 2013, the trial had been initiated in Canada [&lt;ulink linkID="1510540" linkType="Reference"&gt;1510540&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2014, site activation and patient enrollment was continued [&lt;ulink linkID="1534879" linkType="Reference"&gt;1534879&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2014, the DSMB recommended continuation of the trial following an interim  review of trial's unblinded safety data. At that time, enrollment was expected to complete  in the second half of 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1544856" linkType="Reference"&gt;1544856&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By August 2014, over 50% of patients had been enrolled and treated [&lt;ulink linkID="1585519" linkType="Reference"&gt;1585519&lt;/ulink&gt;]. 	In August 2014, the patient enrollment was ongoing and planned to enroll 108 patient by the end of that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1587681" linkType="Reference"&gt;1587681&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2015, the patient enrollment was completed.

In March 2016, positive top-line results from 114 patients treated in the trial were reported. Data demonstrated that the trial met its primary endpoint of reduction in the total number of deaths, cardiovascular hospitalizations or unplanned outpatient and emergency department visits to treat acute decompensated heart failure during the 12 months following treatment with ixmyelocel-T compared to placebo. At that time, full data results were expected to be presented in April 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1742333" linkType="Reference"&gt;1742333&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2016, similar data were published and data were to be presented at the American College of Cardiology 65th Annual Scientific Session &amp;amp; Expo on April 4, 2016 held in Chicago, IL [&lt;ulink linkID="1746811" linkType="Reference"&gt;1746811&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2016, data were presented at the American College of Cardiology 65th Annual Scientific Session &amp;amp; Expo  held in Chicago, IL. A 37% resuction in   all-cause deaths, cardiovascular hospitalizations, or unplanned outpatient and emergency department visits was observed. A statistically significant reduction in clinical events driven by both cardiac mortality and cardiac hospitalizations at 12 months was observed when compared to placebo. The Win ratio result was found to be  1.56 [&lt;ulink linkID="1748739" linkType="Reference"&gt;1748739&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1748757" linkType="Reference"&gt;1748757&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2016, similar clinical data were presented at GTCBio's Stem Cell Summit 2016 in Boston, MA. Despite encouraging positive trends, no statistically meaningful data were observed regarding secondary efficacy [&lt;ulink linkID="1762138" linkType="Reference"&gt;1762138&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2016, the first patient was treated in the crossover portion of the study; in November 2016, data were expected to be presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sections 2016 in New Orleans, Louisiana [&lt;ulink linkID="1870750" linkType="Reference"&gt;1870750&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2016, further data from the trial were presented at the AHA's Scientific Sessions 2016 in New Orleans, LA. The events/100 patient years were 72.16, 69.76, and 69.76 versus 121.73, 109.97, and 112.17 in treated patients (n = 114), per protocol (n = 109), and sensitivity analysis (n = 109), respectively. During the 12 month follow-up, all the 58 and 50 out of 51 patients in the ixmyelocel-T and placebo groups, respectively had automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) interrogation and the events/100 patient years and rate ratio detected by AICD were 236.42 and 0.76, respectively in the ixmyelocel-T group [&lt;ulink linkID="1872029" linkType="Reference"&gt;1872029&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2017, treatment was  completed  in eligible patients in the open-label crossover extension portion of the ixCELL-DCM study [&lt;ulink linkID="1926440" linkType="Reference"&gt;1926440&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By August 2012, the company completed preparations to initiate  the phase IIb RENEW-DCM clinical study to evaluate the potential of catheter administration of ixmyelocel-T to prevent cardiac events  in patients with ischemic DCM, later this month. At that time, the study was expected to be completed in approximately 12 months and  top-line results were to be reported in 2014  [&lt;ulink linkID="1313924" linkType="Reference"&gt;1313924&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By November 2009, the company had filed an IND for a clinical trial using a catheter to deliver the cells to DCM patients. Site training was expected to begin in December 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="1055719" linkType="Reference"&gt;1055719&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The IND was approved in November 2009. The US,   multicenter, randomized, open-label,  controlled, prospective, phase II trial would enroll 12 patients with ischemic DCM and 12 patients with non-ischemic DCM. The primary objective would be  safety of the therapy when delivered by  catheter.  Heart failure and cardiac function parameters would also be assessed [&lt;ulink linkID="1056282" linkType="Reference"&gt;1056282&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2010, enrollment was to start in the first quarter of 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1074450" linkType="Reference"&gt;1074450&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By May 2010, patient enrollment had begun at two sites. Patient treatment was expected to begin later that month [&lt;ulink linkID="1097249" linkType="Reference"&gt;1097249&lt;/ulink&gt;]; later in May 2010, the first patient was treated [&lt;ulink linkID="1100141" linkType="Reference"&gt;1100141&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2011, 6-month data  were expected in  the third quarter of 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1162432" linkType="Reference"&gt;1162432&lt;/ulink&gt;] and in February 2011, the company expected to complete the trial in the third quarter of that year and to launch the next phase of testing for DCM by the end of that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1171747" linkType="Reference"&gt;1171747&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By November 2011, 6-month topline data had been reported showing that in the catheter fewer adverse events had been seen than in the IMPACT-DMC study at 12 months. Efficacy was comparable [&lt;ulink linkID="1237845" linkType="Reference"&gt;1237845&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2012, data  from the 12-month, phase IIa study in 22 patients with class III/IV heart failure were to be presented at the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions scientific sessions in Las Vegas, NV [&lt;ulink linkID="1288409" linkType="Reference"&gt;1288409&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2007, the company was planning clinical trials for cardiac regeneration in DCM [&lt;ulink linkID="762442" linkType="Reference"&gt;762442&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2008, the FDA approved Aastrom's IND for a phase II trial for DCM. In the multicenter, randomized, controlled, prospective, open-label study, 20 patients with ischemic DCM would be enrolled, along with 20 patients with non-ischemic DCM. Subjects would receive the therapy, injected into the heart muscle during open heart surgery, plus standard medical care (SMC) or SMC alone and would be followed for 12 months post-treatment. The primary objective was safety, although efficacy would also be measured [&lt;ulink linkID="917530" linkType="Reference"&gt;917530&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By June 2008, the IMPACT-DCM trial was underway [&lt;ulink linkID="917887" linkType="Reference"&gt;917887&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2008, the company expected to complete enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="939419" linkType="Reference"&gt;939419&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2008, the company expected to begin treatment during the fourth quarter of 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="960942" linkType="Reference"&gt;960942&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later that month, Aastrom reported the first patient had been treated [&lt;ulink linkID="965565" linkType="Reference"&gt;965565&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2009, data were presented at the Fourth Annual Stem Cell Summit in New York, NY. Two patients showed significant improvement in ejection fraction, from 10 to 30% and from 25-30 to 45% pre- and 30-days post-treatment, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="988646" linkType="Reference"&gt;988646&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2009, an FDA clinical hold was placed on the trial, following a serious adverse event associated with anesthesia management experienced by one patient. The patient had fully recovered and the clinical site and the independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) determined that the event was not related to the therapeutic intervention. At that time, a review was underway. Patient follow-up and monitoring would continue, and treatment would proceed for one patient previously enrolled in the trial [&lt;ulink linkID="981017" linkType="Reference"&gt;981017&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2009, the hold was lifted. Enrollment in the trial was to resume and was expected to be completed in 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="988923" linkType="Reference"&gt;988923&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2009, results from three patients who had completed the 3-month follow-up visit showed they had improved from New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III to class II. Two of three control patients did not improve NYHA class. Quality of life scores were also improved in all drug-treated patients. No serious adverse events were reported by four drug-treated patients who had completed the 1-month follow-up. At that time, enrollment was expected to complete by the end of 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="1006523" linkType="Reference"&gt;1006523&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, later in May 2009, Aastrom voluntarily suspended enrollment and treatment in the study and the FDA then placed a clinical hold on the trial, following the death of one patient at home after having been released from hospital following treatment. The cause of death had not been determined and both the FDA and an independent DSMB were conducting investigations into the event [&lt;ulink linkID="1012079" linkType="Reference"&gt;1012079&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2009, the clinical hold was lifted after autopsy and medical records attributed the death to disease progression [&lt;ulink linkID="1019185" linkType="Reference"&gt;1019185&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By September 2009, a total of 21 patients had been enrolled in the trial. At that time, the company expected to complete enrollment by the end of December 2009 and to analyze preliminary 6-month data on all 40 expected patients in mid-2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1041829" linkType="Reference"&gt;1041829&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By November 2009, 29 patients had been enrolled. Interim data were to be reported later that month at the American Heart Association scientific sessions in Orlando, FL and in the first quarter of 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1055719" linkType="Reference"&gt;1055719&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Later in November 2009,  interim data from the IMPACT-DCM trial were presented at the AHA Scientific Sessions in Orlando, FL. In  seven  patients treated with the therapy who  completed the 1-month follow-up visit, one and three patients had improved to the  NYHA Class I and  Class II  heart failure classification, respectively, whereas the NYHA Class did not improve in three of the five control patients. At the 3-month follow-up visit,   out of six treatment patients, one and two patients improved to NYHA Class I and  Class II, respectively, whereas the NYHA Class did not improve in four of the five control patients. At the 6-month follow-up visit,   out of five treatment patients, two and two patients improved to NYHA Class I and  Class II, respectively, and one patient deteriorated to NYHA Class IV. In contrast,  the NYHA Class did not improve in three of the five control patients  and  included one patient who deteriorated to NYHA Class IV [&lt;ulink linkID="1057397" linkType="Reference"&gt;1057397&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2010, 6-month interim data were anticipated in the third quarter of 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1074450" linkType="Reference"&gt;1074450&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2010, the final patient    was treated [&lt;ulink linkID="1080579" linkType="Reference"&gt;1080579&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By May 2010, all 40 patients had been enrolled. At that time, 6-month interim data on all patients were expected during the fourth quarter of 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1097249" linkType="Reference"&gt;1097249&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2010, the company began an extension study of IMPACT-DCM, in which control patients would be able to receive the therapy; enrollment was expected to begin that quarter. By that time, the safety board monitoring the study had positively reviewed safety and efficacy data from the first 20 patients in IMPACT-DCM [&lt;ulink linkID="1116112" linkType="Reference"&gt;1116112&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2011, 12-month data were expected in the second quarter of 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1162432" linkType="Reference"&gt;1162432&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2011, results from the 12-month follow-up study and 6-month interim analysis were presented at the 15th Annual Heart Failure Society of America Scientific Meeting, Boston. The drug was well-tolerated and the efficacy observations related to structural and functional end points including New York Heart Association  functional classification, 6-min walk distance, and septal wall thickening, were found to be consistent with improved function of impaired myocardium [&lt;ulink linkID="1223686" linkType="Reference"&gt;1223686&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2013, further data were presented at the 2013 ASGCT Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City, UT. The ixmyelocel-T was  well tolerated with consistent positive trends for efficacy [&lt;ulink linkID="1420681" linkType="Reference"&gt;1420681&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2014, similar data were published from 59 patients treated or received standard of care out of 61 randomized patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1587681" linkType="Reference"&gt;1587681&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1587741" linkType="Reference"&gt;1587741&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By   the end of December 2007, treatment in Europe on a  compassionate-use basis for DCM had begun. At that  time, data from these patients were anticipated in 2008   [&lt;ulink linkID="867926" linkType="Reference"&gt;867926&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In August 2008, the company reported that 'encouraging clinical data' had been achieved by  two patients treated in the trial. At that time, the company planned to initiate a full European clinical trial in the second half of 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="939419" linkType="Reference"&gt;939419&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2007, at the second annual European Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Congress in London, UK, Aastrom announced its plans to initiate a phase I/II pilot trial with these cells in patients with chronic heart disease in 2007. At that time, the  program was  in preclinical studies [&lt;ulink linkID="792618" linkType="Reference"&gt;792618&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="792847" linkType="Reference"&gt;792847&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Limb ischemia&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2010,   the company was planning to initiate a phase III trial  for CLI [&lt;ulink linkID="1077162" linkType="Reference"&gt;1077162&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in July 2010, the company planned to pursue the phase III program through the US FDA's SPA process [&lt;ulink linkID="1113783" linkType="Reference"&gt;1113783&lt;/ulink&gt;];  in October 2010, the company submitted a SPA to the FDA and the study was expected to begin in early 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1140151" linkType="Reference"&gt;1140151&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1140919" linkType="Reference"&gt;1140919&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2011, the first of two phase III trials was expected to begin in mid-2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1171747" linkType="Reference"&gt;1171747&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2011, &lt;ulink linkID="1062135" linkType="Company"&gt;CPC Clinical Research&lt;/ulink&gt; was to support the phase III REVIVE-CLI study [&lt;ulink linkID="1194941" linkType="Reference"&gt;1194941&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1240169" linkType="Reference"&gt;1240169&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2011, the company established an independent steering committee to support the trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1202167" linkType="Reference"&gt;1202167&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2011, Aastrom reached an agreement on the SPA with FDA for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study in no-option patients (expected n = 594) with CLI in the US. At that time, the company expected to initiate the study in the fourth quarter of 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1210209" linkType="Reference"&gt;1210209&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1241639" linkType="Reference"&gt;1241639&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February  2012, the study (&lt;ulink linkID="82939" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01483898&lt;/ulink&gt;; ABI 55-1009-1) was initiated, with an estimated completion date of   March 2015 [&lt;ulink linkID="1259741" linkType="Reference"&gt;1259741&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1267751" linkType="Reference"&gt;1267751&lt;/ulink&gt;]; in May 2012, the first patient was enrolled in the multicenter study [&lt;ulink linkID="1289169" linkType="Reference"&gt;1289169&lt;/ulink&gt;]; later that month, data were to be presented at the World Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Congress in London, UK, on May 21, 2012 [&lt;ulink linkID="1291985" linkType="Reference"&gt;1291985&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2012, the company planned to complete enrollment by the middle of 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1313924" linkType="Reference"&gt;1313924&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2013, the company announced that the trial was no longer recruiting patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1417529" linkType="Reference"&gt;1417529&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By June 2013, the company amended the protocol to evaluate enrolled patients for safety and efficacy endpoints at 12 months [&lt;ulink linkID="1462998" linkType="Reference"&gt;1462998&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2014, the trial was progressing towards completion [&lt;ulink linkID="1534879" linkType="Reference"&gt;1534879&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2014, preliminary analysis of data showed positive trends in amputation-free survival and wound closure [&lt;ulink linkID="1557910" linkType="Reference"&gt;1557910&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2007, a US phase IIb RESTORE-CLI  trial began for peripheral arterial disease patients with CLI. Participants in the 150-patient, 12-month, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study were to receive injections of either the stem cell therapy or placebo into their affected limbs. The primary objective was safety and secondary objectives included amputation rates, wound closure, blood flow in the affected limbs and quality of life, reduction of pain, and analgesic use [&lt;ulink linkID="788782" linkType="Reference"&gt;788782&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2007,  the first patient had been dosed in the study [&lt;ulink linkID="809518" linkType="Reference"&gt;809518&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="829251" linkType="Reference"&gt;829251&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In September 2008, the DSMB recommended continuation of the study. In October 2008, the company reported that it had treated 30 patients in the trial. Once the 30th patient had been followed for one year, the company would unblind and analyze the interim data [&lt;ulink linkID="957970" linkType="Reference"&gt;957970&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2009, data were presented at the Fourth Annual Stem Cell Summit in New York, NY. Early data  showed total wound closure in 44 weeks [&lt;ulink linkID="988646" linkType="Reference"&gt;988646&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By November 2009, the first 30 patients had completed their one-year follow-up visits. At that time, unblinding, analysis and reporting of data from a subset of patients was expected in the first quarter of 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1055719" linkType="Reference"&gt;1055719&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2010, interim results were reported. Data demonstrated  that the autologous vascular repair cells were more effective than placebo  in time to treatment failure. Other clinical endpoints such as major amputation rate, complete wound closure approached but did not reach  significance. The analysis included data from  46  patients who had at least a 6-month follow up and 33 patients who had had a 12-month follow up. The company would conclude  enrollment  of new patients  in order to complete the study as soon as possible so that planning could begin on the phase III program could be planned  [&lt;ulink linkID="1077162" linkType="Reference"&gt;1077162&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2010, the final patient    was treated. At  that time,  86 patients had been enrolled in the trial and  6-month interim data were expected  later in 2010  [&lt;ulink linkID="1085180" linkType="Reference"&gt;1085180&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2010, interim data on all patients were expected to be  reported in the fourth quarter of 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1097249" linkType="Reference"&gt;1097249&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2010, interim data were reported  at the Society for Vascular Surgery meeting in Boston, MA. The data demonstrated the achievement of statistical significance on amputation-free survival [&lt;ulink linkID="1107588" linkType="Reference"&gt;1107588&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1113783" linkType="Reference"&gt;1113783&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2010, interim data from all 86 patients were presented at the VEITH Symposium. Data showed that the trial met its primary safety and efficacy (first occurrence of treatment failure) endpoints. Amputation-free survival did not show statistical significance [&lt;ulink linkID="1149249" linkType="Reference"&gt;1149249&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Final data were reported in June 2011. The drug met all of the trial's primary and secondary endpoints and improved time-to-first treatment failure. Full final data were to be reported in the fourth quarter of that year [&lt;ulink linkID="1196968" linkType="Reference"&gt;1196968&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Interim data were published later in June 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1202949" linkType="Reference"&gt;1202949&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1203002" linkType="Reference"&gt;1203002&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In July 2011, data from the trial were to be presented at a major medical meeting in November 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1210209" linkType="Reference"&gt;1210209&lt;/ulink&gt;].  By September 2011,  more than 200 patients had been enrolled in the trial [&lt;ulink linkID="1228095" linkType="Reference"&gt;1228095&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2011,  positive 12-month final results from 72 patients were presented at the AHA scientific sessions in Orlando, FL. Results  showed that the trial met its primary end point of safety,  with no differences between treated and control groups. A total of 39.6% of patients in the ixmyelocel-T group, compared with 66.7% of patients in the placebo, met the primary efficacy endpoint of first occurrence of treatment failure, with a 62% reduction in risk relative to placebo (p = 0.0032).      Statistical significance in the secondary endpoint of amputation-free survival  rates was not attained but a positive trend was exhibited  in a subgroup of 45 patients  with a  measure of 21% in drug treated group  versus 44% control event rate (p = 0.0802). Post-hoc analysis showed that treatment effect was more pronounced in patients who had baseline wounds than those who did not  [&lt;ulink linkID="1240169" linkType="Reference"&gt;1240169&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="1241639" linkType="Reference"&gt;1241639&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2012, final data were published. Data reported  that treatment with ixmyelocel-T improved time to treatment failure in patients with CLI compared to the control group and in the subgroup of patients with wounds at baseline,  an improvement was seen in amputation free survival. The drug was well tolerated. Data also reported that patients (n = 48) in the treatment arm showed a 62% reduction in risk relative to patients (n = 24) in placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint of time to first occurrence of treatment failure (p = 0.0032). Post hoc analysis of the subgroup of  patients (n = 45) with wounds at baseline resulted in a 77% risk reduction in time to first occurrence of treatment failure (p = 0.0002) and a positive trend in the amputation-free survival (61% risk reduction, p = 0.0915) [&lt;ulink linkID="1278119" linkType="Reference"&gt;1278119&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1278373" linkType="Reference"&gt;1278373&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Diabetic complications&lt;/subtitle&gt;In October 2004, Aastrom signed an agreement with the Heart and Diabetes Center North Rhine-Westphalia, in  Germany, for a feasibility clinical trial in up to 50 diabetic patients with lower limb ischemia.  The randomized study was to have three treatment groups: patients treated with bone marrow-derived TRCs produced using Replicell;  patients treated with a sample of the unadulterated bone marrow;  and  the standard  care.  Two routes of administration were to be evaluated for the cell therapies.  The primary endpoint was to include improvement in vascularization and ulcer healing, as well as recovery of mobility and reduced mortality.    The trial was expected to begin recruitment by the middle of 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="567409" linkType="Reference"&gt;567409&lt;/ulink&gt;]; however, by June 2005 it was expected that the trial would begin by the end of 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="672569" linkType="Reference"&gt;672569&lt;/ulink&gt;].  Enrollment of up to 25 patients began in October 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="672456" linkType="Reference"&gt;672456&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By June 2006, the drug was in proof-of-concept clinical studies [&lt;ulink linkID="672456" linkType="Reference"&gt;672456&lt;/ulink&gt;].  Data were presented from a trial in  patients with diabetic foot callus at the European Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Congress, London, UK. Treated patients expressed mature vasculature, new bone, active bone formation and a decrease in the need for allograft matrix extender at 3 months post-treatment. The studies showed that there was little relationship between dose and efficacy in stem cell therapies [&lt;ulink linkID="672566" linkType="Reference"&gt;672566&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="673008" linkType="Reference"&gt;673008&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Interim data from   13 patients in the phase I/II trial were presented in October 2007 at the German Society for Stem Cell Research in Wurzburg, Germany, showing the therapy was safe. There were no adverse events 12 months post-treatment  and patients displayed healing of all open wounds. Of the seven patients treated with normal bone marrow cells, five had similar results  to  TRC-treated patients after 12 months. One patient  reported similar results to  TRC-treated patients 18 months after treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="836418" linkType="Reference"&gt;836418&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2009, further data presumed to be from the phase I/II trial were presented at the 12th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene Therapy in San Diego, CA. The study completed in May 2008 with 24 patients treated. Safety measures included MACE (major adverse cardiac events), injection site infection, deep vein thrombosis and anaphylaxis, and efficacy measures included time to amputation. One serious adverse event was reported and the limb salvage rate at one year was 92% [&lt;ulink linkID="1017087" linkType="Reference"&gt;1017087&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Other studies&lt;/subtitle&gt;In September 2007, a randomized, parallel-assignment, single-blind, phase II trial (&lt;ulink linkID="205713" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00505219&lt;/ulink&gt;; ABI 55-0705-1) was initiated in the US in patients (n = 11) with osteonecrosis.

Statistically significant upregulation of cholesterol transporter genes ABAC1 and ABCG1  were observed when ixmyelocel-T macrophages were loaded with cholesterol. Ixmyelocel-T exhibited enhanced apolipoprotein A-I-mediated cholesterol efflux and in in vivo reverse cholesterol transport assay, ixmyelocel-T was able to efflux cholesterol [&lt;ulink linkID="1495737" linkType="Reference"&gt;1495737&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1495665" linkType="Reference"&gt;1495665&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2013, data were published. Surface markers of M2 macrophages, CD206 and CD163, were expressed by the macrophages in ixmyelocel-T therapy. Several M2 markers, and little to no M1 markers were also expressed by the cells. Compared to M1 and M2 macrophages, minimal secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha was shown after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide.

It was found that   macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1) integrin complex was expressed by 50% of total mixture of TRCs and highest expression of Mac-1 was exhibited by granulocytes and macrophages based on co-expression of CD66b and CD14. Further, characterization studies showed that CD14 macrophages and CD90 marrow stromal cells (MSCs) were increased in ex-vivo culture and could be inhibited by using neutralizing antibodies to CD11b, CD18 and the MAC-1 complex  which would thereby block MAC-1 binding. It was also found that the expansion of CD90 MSCs was blocked by the MAC-1 neutralizing antibodies [&lt;ulink linkID="1225846" linkType="Reference"&gt;1225846&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1227325" linkType="Reference"&gt;1227325&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2008, preclinical data were presented at GTCbio's Advances in Stem Cell Discoveries Conference in San Francisco, CA.
