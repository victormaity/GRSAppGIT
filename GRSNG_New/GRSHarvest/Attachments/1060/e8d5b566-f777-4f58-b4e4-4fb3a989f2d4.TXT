In the US, the product is indicated for  the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD), including patients on dialysis and not on dialysis, to decrease the need for red blood cell  transfusion; the treatment of anemia due to &lt;ulink linkID="44316" linkType="Drug"&gt;zidovudine&lt;/ulink&gt; in HIV-infected patients with endogenous serum erythropoietin levels of &amp;lt;/= 500 mUnits/ml; the treatment of chemotherapy-associated anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies; and to reduce the need for allogeneic red blood cell transfusions in patients with perioperative hemoglobin &amp;gt; 10 to &amp;lt;/= 13 g/dl  at high risk for perioperative blood loss from elective, non-cardiac, non-vascular surgery. Amgen markets the drug as Epogen for anemia in CKD patients on dialysis, while &lt;ulink linkID="17332" linkType="Company"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson&lt;/ulink&gt; markets the drug as &lt;ulink linkID="67892" linkType="Drug"&gt;Procrit&lt;/ulink&gt; for dialysis-independent CKD in the US and as &lt;ulink linkID="67892" linkType="Drug"&gt;Eprex&lt;/ulink&gt; for all indications outside the US [&lt;ulink linkID="482634" linkType="Reference"&gt;482634&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1885663" linkType="Reference"&gt;1885663&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1885671" linkType="Reference"&gt;1885671&lt;/ulink&gt;].   In Japan, the drug is indicated for renal anemia during dialysis and for premature infant anemia [&lt;ulink linkID="1885643" linkType="Reference"&gt;1885643&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Epoetin alfa  has been marketed in the US since 1989 [&lt;ulink linkID="178694" linkType="Reference"&gt;178694&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The product was launched in Japan in April 1990 [&lt;ulink linkID="1219027" linkType="Reference"&gt;1219027&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 1999, US approval was granted for dialysis-induced anemia in children with chronic renal failure [&lt;ulink linkID="1218693" linkType="Reference"&gt;1218693&lt;/ulink&gt;]. By July 2016, Amgen had transitioned approximately 75% of its patients in the US to  &lt;ulink linkID="7413" linkType="Drug"&gt;Aranesp&lt;/ulink&gt;, which is less frequently administered, in  medium-size and independent dialysis centers [&lt;ulink linkID="1790564" linkType="Reference"&gt;1790564&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1456734" linkType="Reference"&gt;1456734&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><PatentsAndGenerics><displayLabel>Patents and Generics</displayLabel><value>&lt;PatentsAndGenerics&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;The US composition of matter patent, &lt;ulink linkID="IN1051184" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-04703008&lt;/ulink&gt;, expired in October 2004;  however, further continuations, claiming production methods and purified forms, based on US-04703008 were filed; these expire between 2013 and 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="678565" linkType="Reference"&gt;678565&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A further patent covering the use of cells that make certain levels of erythropoietin expired in May 2015 [&lt;ulink linkID="1172338" linkType="Reference"&gt;1172338&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In February 2017, Amgen stated it did not expect a biosimilar entrant in the US until late 2017 at the earliest [&lt;ulink linkID="1898701" linkType="Reference"&gt;1898701&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2011, &lt;ulink linkID="1010293" linkType="Company"&gt;Hospira&lt;/ulink&gt; was developing a biosimilar  epoetin alfa, in collaboration with &lt;ulink linkID="1061238" linkType="Company"&gt;DaVita&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="16562" linkType="Company"&gt;Fresenius Medical Care&lt;/ulink&gt;, and planned to launch the product in the US following patent expiry [&lt;ulink linkID="1220559" linkType="Reference"&gt;1220559&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A BLA for the product (under the tradename &lt;ulink linkID="78948" linkType="Drug"&gt;Retacrit&lt;/ulink&gt;) was filed in December 2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1641389" linkType="Reference"&gt;1641389&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2015, Amgen filed a lawsuit against Hospira for infringement of &lt;ulink linkID="IN2691140" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-05856298&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkID="IN2534297" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-05756349&lt;/ulink&gt;, and seeking a declaration that Hospira should provide Amgen with 180 days notice ahead of commercial launch. A hearing was set for February 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1736448" linkType="Reference"&gt;1736448&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2015, Hospira filed a motion to dismiss the one count of Amgen's complaint which sought a declaration that Hospira had failed to comply with the notice requirements of the BPCIA. In August 2016, a US District Court denied the motion filed by Hospira to dismiss Amgen's complaint. Later that month, Hospira responded to the complaint denying the allegations of the First Amended Complaint and seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit were invalid and not infringed by Hospira. Later in  August, Amgen moved to amend the First Amended Complaint to add additional bases for infringement of Amgen's '349 patent and to add three additional third-party defendants. In October 2016, the US District Court granted-in-part and denied-in-part Amgen's motion to amend, permitting Amgen to add the additional bases for infringement but not the additional parties to the existing lawsuit. In January 2017, the US District Court entered an order construing the claims of the '349 and '298 patents and holding that two claims of the '298 patent were invalid [&lt;ulink linkID="1900450" linkType="Reference"&gt;1900450&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2017, a court found the '349 patent was not infringed, but that the '298 patent was valid and infringed by Hospira. In October 2017, Hospira moved for judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of the '298 patent, or for reduction of the damage award or a new trial regarding the '298 patent [&lt;ulink linkID="2005034" linkType="Reference"&gt;2005034&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In May 2018, Hospira's biosimilar was approved, and it was subsequently launched in November 2018 [&lt;ulink linkID="2119631" linkType="Reference"&gt;2119631&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An evidentiary hearing was held in November 2007, where Amgen presented evidence in its request for a permanent injunction to prevent Roche from launching Mircera; in December 2007, Amgen and Roche filed post-trial motions. Further briefing was heard in January 2008; Roche requested the Court's authorization to sell Mircera in the US with proposed royalty payments to Amgen [&lt;ulink linkID="882174" linkType="Reference"&gt;882174&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2008, a preliminary injunction was granted. The Judge stated that although the injunction was not  permanent, it would be made permanent if Roche did not agree to a royalty payment of 22.5% to Amgen for Roche to begin sales. Roche  accepted these terms in March 2008, and also guaranteed that it would not charge higher prices than Amgen's anemia treatments. Amgen was still seeking a permanent injunction at that time. Also at that time, the Court of Appeals reinstated the complaint bought before the ITC on importing EPO into the US, and the ITC was to rehear the initial complaint [&lt;ulink linkID="895789" linkType="Reference"&gt;895789&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2008, Amgen and Roche were denied post-trial motions and the court upheld the February 2008 verdict in all respects except infringement of a claim in the '933 Patent. The court ruled that the patents-in-suit are valid, enforceable and infringed, and permanently mandated Roche from infringing the '422, '933, '868 and '698 patents for remaining life of these patents. In December 2008, the Roche appealed the District Court's final judgment and permanent injunction. In January 2009, Amgen filed a brief in response to the Roche appeal, and in support of Amgen's December 2007 cross-appeal of the Massachusetts District Court's judgment of non-infringement of the '349 and '933 patent claims. Roche's brief in opposition to Amgen's cross-appeal, and in reply to Amgen's opposition to the Roche appeal was to take place in March 2009 [&lt;ulink linkID="996058" linkType="Reference"&gt;996058&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2009, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit  upheld the Massachusetts District Court's decision, affirming that the Roche product infringed  patents  '868, '698, '933 and '422. The Federal Circuit also reversed the ruling of non-infringement of the '349 patent and remanded that  a new trial  be conducted by  Amgen to show that Roche's product infringes this patent also [&lt;ulink linkID="1041938" linkType="Reference"&gt;1041938&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Amgen and Roche reached a settlement of litigation in December 2009; Roche would be allowed to launch its product in the US in mid-2014 [&lt;ulink linkID="1065544" linkType="Reference"&gt;1065544&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1079232" linkType="Reference"&gt;1079232&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By March 2005, Amgen was in ongoing patent litigation with &lt;ulink linkID="20436" linkType="Company"&gt;Transkaryotic Therapies&lt;/ulink&gt; (TKT, now Shire Pharmaceuticals) and &lt;ulink linkID="27254" linkType="Company"&gt;Aventis&lt;/ulink&gt; (now &lt;ulink linkID="1009547" linkType="Company"&gt;sanofi-aventis&lt;/ulink&gt;) regarding a TKT-developed gene-activated EPO product, &lt;ulink linkID="14230" linkType="Drug"&gt;epoetin delta&lt;/ulink&gt;, to which Aventis holds marketing rights. After a remand from the US Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2003, a partial retrial was concluded in November 2003, and in October 2004 the district court issued rulings that upheld its initial findings in 2001, that Amgen's patent claims were valid and infringed. Further proceedings and an appeal were expected [&lt;ulink linkID="598139" linkType="Reference"&gt;598139&lt;/ulink&gt;]. API and TKT filed an appeal with the US Court of Appeals in December 2004; by March 2006, the appeal had been heard with a decision expected later in the year [&lt;ulink linkID="659452" linkType="Reference"&gt;659452&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2005, Amgen filed a suit in the US against &lt;ulink linkID="19446" linkType="Company"&gt;Roche&lt;/ulink&gt; in relation to Roche's  &lt;ulink linkID="35644" linkType="Drug"&gt;&lt;/ulink&gt;&lt;ulink linkID="35644" linkType="Drug"&gt;Mircera&lt;/ulink&gt; for infringement of six patents  that claim erythropoietin (EPO) products and pharmaceutical compositions, and processes for making EPO [&lt;ulink linkID="635120" linkType="Reference"&gt;635120&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="632621" linkType="Reference"&gt;632621&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Amgen also filed a complaint in April 2006 alleging that Roche's importing of EPO to the US was unlawful because the method of its manufacture is covered by Amgen patents [&lt;ulink linkID="663606" linkType="Reference"&gt;663606&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in July 2006 the International Trade Commission judged Roche's importing of EPO to the US as subject to clinical trial exemption. This decision, however, had no bearing on Amgen's pending patent infringement lawsuit against Roche, nor did it prevent Amgen from refiling its complaint nearer the time of a potential commercial launch by Roche [&lt;ulink linkID="678399" linkType="Reference"&gt;678399&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The importation case was officially closed by the ITC in August 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="687015" linkType="Reference"&gt;687015&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In October 2006, the US Federal District Court denied Roche's motion to dismiss Amgen's patent infringement lawsuit against Roche [&lt;ulink linkID="733583" linkType="Reference"&gt;733583&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2007, the US Federal District Court in Boston granted Amgen's motion for summary judgment and ruled that Mircera will infringe Amgen's composition patent number &lt;ulink linkID="IN2543630" linkType="Patent"&gt;US-05955422&lt;/ulink&gt;. In a separate decision, the court also granted summary judgment in favor of Amgen on certain Roche defenses against the patents-in-suit. In October 2007, a jury in the US Federal District Court in Boston, MA, ruled that Roche infringed 11 Amgen EPO patent claims. Amgen  intended to seek an injunction to prevent the US commercialization as it would be in violation of Amgen's affirmed patent rights; an injunction hearing was scheduled for November 15, 2007. Roche was evaluating its legal options, including the possibility of an appeal. The company maintained that all its patents were valid and did not infringe any of Amgen's epoetin patents [&lt;ulink linkID="843039" linkType="Reference"&gt;843039&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="843040" linkType="Reference"&gt;843040&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;The principal patent in Europe expired in December 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="1079232" linkType="Reference"&gt;1079232&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2004, in an action brought by TKT and Aventis against Amgen and Ortho Biotech, a UK court invalidated the pertinent claims of Amgen's UK patent on EPO, which expired in December 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="598139" linkType="Reference"&gt;598139&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Japan&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2010, &lt;ulink linkID="17665" linkType="Company"&gt;Kissei Pharmaceutical&lt;/ulink&gt; launched a biosimilar version of epoetin alfa (&lt;ulink linkID="54441" linkType="Drug"&gt;Epoetin alfa BS injection&lt;/ulink&gt;) in Japan; the product was the first biosimilar EPO to be approved in Japan [&lt;ulink linkID="1115330" linkType="Reference"&gt;1115330&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/PatentsAndGenerics&gt;</value></PatentsAndGenerics><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;By July 2016, Amgen had transitioned approximately 75% patients in the US to  &lt;ulink linkID="7413" linkType="Drug"&gt;Aranesp&lt;/ulink&gt;, which is less frequently administered, in  medium-size and independent dialysis centers [&lt;ulink linkID="1790564" linkType="Reference"&gt;1790564&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1456734" linkType="Reference"&gt;1456734&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The FDA approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) in February 2010. As part of the REMS, a medication guide explaining the risks and benefits of ESAs was to be provided to patients receiving ESAs, and healthcare providers were required to train and enroll in the ESA APPRISE (Assisting Providers and cancer Patients with Risk Information for the Safe use of ESAs) Oncology Program [&lt;ulink linkID="1075480" linkType="Reference"&gt;1075480&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1075481" linkType="Reference"&gt;1075481&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1075545" linkType="Reference"&gt;1075545&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 1999, the product was granted approval in the US for dialysis-induced anemia in pediatric patients with chronic renal failure [&lt;ulink linkID="1218693" linkType="Reference"&gt;1218693&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Epoetin alfa had been approved and launched in the US by 1989, by which time it had been granted Orphan Drug status [&lt;ulink linkID="178694" linkType="Reference"&gt;178694&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Japan&lt;/subtitle&gt;Epoetin alfa was launched in Japan in April 1990 [&lt;ulink linkID="1219027" linkType="Reference"&gt;1219027&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;China&lt;/subtitle&gt;By October 2008, epoetin alfa had been launched in China  [&lt;ulink linkID="947785" linkType="Reference"&gt;947785&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;SAFETY INFORMATION&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;The US&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2007, the US label was revised to include a boxed warning, advising physicians to use the lowest possible dose to gradually increase hemoglobin (Hb) concentration to the lowest level sufficient to avoid the need for red blood cell transfusion. There was also a warning that epoetin alfa, like other erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), increased the risk for death and for serious cardiovascular events when administered to target a Hb of &amp;gt; 12 g/dl [&lt;ulink linkID="772986" linkType="Reference"&gt;772986&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="773045" linkType="Reference"&gt;773045&lt;/ulink&gt;].    &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The FDA's ODAC  convened in May 2007 and recommended additional label restrictions, additional clinical trials to more clearly define the benefits and risks associated with ESAs, additions to labels to indicate ESAs are not recommended in certain tumor types, a defined Hb level for initiation of treatment, and discontinued use after chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="811053" linkType="Reference"&gt;811053&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2007, dosage instructions for cancer patients were modified to reinforce that ESA therapy should be discontinued following the completion of chemotherapy. Additionally, six new trials were announced by Amgen to clarify the safety of the ESAs [&lt;ulink linkID="849386" linkType="Reference"&gt;849386&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="849222" linkType="Reference"&gt;849222&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Ortho further presented previously requested safety data and risk minimization strategies at a March 2008 FDA ODAC panel meeting, supporting the continued use of epoetin alfa in chemotherapy-induced anemia and asserting that the drug was safe and effective when used according to the label [&lt;ulink linkID="884673" linkType="Reference"&gt;884673&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The ODAC voted in favor of retaining currently approved cancer-related anemia indications, but recommended that the drugs should not be used in patients with metastatic head, neck or breast cancers [&lt;ulink linkID="885942" linkType="Reference"&gt;885942&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="885718" linkType="Reference"&gt;885718&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2008, Ortho responded to the ODAC vote by issuing a statement expressing its concern and urging the FDA to consider all data, including "substantial new data", before reaching its final decision regarding patients with metastatic head, neck or breast cancers [&lt;ulink linkID="887233" linkType="Reference"&gt;887233&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In August 2008, Amgen updated the ESA product label agreed following the ODAC meeting; the label amendments included a boxed warning that ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive therapy when the anticipated outcome of such therapy is cure, the addition of a statement that ESA therapy should not be initiated at Hb levels &amp;gt;/= 10 g/dl and that dose should be adjusted to maintain the lowest Hb level sufficient to avoid red blood cell transfusions, and the removal of reference to the upper safety limit of 12 g/dl. In October 2008, the product information for all ESAs was further updated to advise that in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for anemia in patients with cancer and the decision to administer ESAs should be based on a benefit-risk assessment [&lt;ulink linkID="996058" linkType="Reference"&gt;996058&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The FDA approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) in February 2010. As part of the REMS, a medication guide explaining the risks and benefits of ESAs was to be provided to patients receiving ESAs, and healthcare providers were required to train and enroll in the ESA APPRISE (Assisting Providers and cancer Patients with Risk Information for the Safe use of ESAs) Oncology Program [&lt;ulink linkID="1075480" linkType="Reference"&gt;1075480&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1075481" linkType="Reference"&gt;1075481&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1075545" linkType="Reference"&gt;1075545&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Beginning February 2011, Amgen was required to ensure that no distributors ship ESAs to any healthcare provider until such provider was enrolled in the APPRISE program [&lt;ulink linkID="1172338" linkType="Reference"&gt;1172338&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In June 2011, the FDA was continuing to evaluate the REMS for ESAs [&lt;ulink linkID="1203092" linkType="Reference"&gt;1203092&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2017, the FDA reevaluated its stance on the use and implementation of the REMS program in the treatment of patients with anemia due to chemotherapy. The FDA deemed it no longer necessary to ensure that the benefits outweigh its risks of shortened overall survival and/or increased risk of tumor progression and the FDA also concluded it is no longer necessary to require the certification of prescribers  [&lt;ulink linkID="2080120" linkType="Reference"&gt;2080120&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2007, Amgen presented data to a joint meeting of FDA advisory committees highlighting the appropriate use and critical role of ESAs in managing anemia patients with chronic renal failure. The company stressed the importance of the ongoing TREAT trial and recommended a Hb target of 10 to 12 g/dl [&lt;ulink linkID="829413" linkType="Reference"&gt;829413&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The panel then voted 14 to 5 against an FDA proposal to cap the upper range of the drug's use to a Hb target of 11 g/dl [&lt;ulink linkID="846465" linkType="Reference"&gt;846465&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Amgen and Ortho Biotech amended the US labels for both Epogen and Procrit in November 2007; the upper cap of 12 g/dl was maintained. For renal patients who do not attain a Hb level within this range despite the use of ESA dose titration over a 12-week period, the instructions were modified to not administer higher ESA doses, and to use the lowest dose that will maintain a Hb level sufficient to avoid the need for recurrent red blood cell transfusions [&lt;ulink linkID="849386" linkType="Reference"&gt;849386&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="849222" linkType="Reference"&gt;849222&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2010, the FDA held a CRDAC meeting to review results from the TREAT study conducted in chronic renal failure patients not on dialysis with type-2 diabetes and moderate anemia, to inform the appropriate use of ESAs in CKD; this included a review of Amgen's proposed labeling changes regarding the use of ESAs in chronic renal failure patients not on dialysis that would limit treatment to patients who are most likely to benefit, specifically those with significant anemia (Hb &amp;lt;10 g/dl), and who are at high risk for transfusion and for whom transfusion avoidance is considered clinically important, including where it is important to preserve kidney transplant eligibility. In addition to narrowing the patient population, Amgen was proposing a more conservative dosing algorithm in those patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1172338" linkType="Reference"&gt;1172338&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2011, the US label was revised in the setting of anemia associated with CKD to include a boxed warning advising of an increased risk of death, serious cardiovascular reactions and stroke following administration of ESAs to target an Hb level of &amp;gt; 11g/dl. Physicians were also advised to consider initiating treatment with epoetin alfa in patients with CKD-associated anemia who were not on dialysis only at an Hb level of &amp;lt;10 g/dl, when the aim was to reduce red blood cell transfusion-related risks and when the rate of Hb decline suggested the likelihood of a transfusion. Additional guidance was provided to reduce or interrupt the epoetin alfa for this patient group if the Hb level exceeded 10 g/dl and to use the lowest dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. For patients with CKD-associated anemia receiving dialysis, the guidance was to initiate treatment with epoetin alfa only at an Hb level of &amp;lt;10 g/dl, reducing the dose or interrupting treatment if the Hb level exceeded 11 g/dl [&lt;ulink linkID="1203092" linkType="Reference"&gt;1203092&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1203093" linkType="Reference"&gt;1203093&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In light of emerging safety concerns, the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) reviewed its coverage of ESAs. In July 2007, a National Coverage Decision (NCD) from the CMS limited Medicare coverage of ESAs and concluded that ESA treatment "is not reasonable and necessary" for certain conditions either because of its harmful effect on the underlying disease or an increased risk of adverse effects [&lt;ulink linkID="846401" linkType="Reference"&gt;846401&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2007, the US Senate sought to nullify this NCD amid fears that the restricted use of ESAs would "require thousands of patients to seek blood transfusions that could have been avoided" [&lt;ulink linkID="846408" linkType="Reference"&gt;846408&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2008, the CMS's Erythropoietin Monitoring Policy (EMP) revisions became effective, and required a 50% reduction in Medicare reimbursement if a patient's Hb level was above 13 g/dl for 3 or more consecutive months. In addition, the EMP reduced the monthly dosing limits for epoetin alfa from 500,000 IU to 400,000 IU [&lt;ulink linkID="996058" linkType="Reference"&gt;996058&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2010, CMS held a MEDCAC meeting to examine the available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in CKD. In June 2010, CMS opened an NCA to examine the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia, to work towards developing a National Coverage Determination (NCD) which could limit or exclude Medicare coverage. In addition, CMS held another MEDCAC meeting in January 2011 to review the available evidence on the impact of ESA use on renal transplant graft survival [&lt;ulink linkID="1172338" linkType="Reference"&gt;1172338&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2011, the CMS determined it would not issue an NCD for ESAs for treatment of anemia in adults with CKD, and that it would instead monitor the use of ESAs through its bundled payment system. In November 2011, the CMS finalized a rule to update various provisions of its bundled payment system for dialysis services; the final rule eliminated the Quality Incentive Program's measure that tracks the percent of a provider's Medicare patients with a Hb level below 10 g/dL for 2013 and beyond  [&lt;ulink linkID="1267859" linkType="Reference"&gt;1267859&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Europe&lt;/subtitle&gt;By August 2007,  EU regulators were also reviewing prescribing information for ESAs [&lt;ulink linkID="823221" linkType="Reference"&gt;823221&lt;/ulink&gt;], and in September 2007, the CHMP proposed amendments to the prescribing information for ESAs in the EU. The proposal included stipulating a target Hb range of 10  to 12 g/dl with guidance to avoid sustained Hb levels of greater than 12 g/dl, and amending the warnings to indicate that trials have shown an unexplained excess mortality in association with high target Hb concentrations [&lt;ulink linkID="834028" linkType="Reference"&gt;834028&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These amendments were made in March 2008 [&lt;ulink linkID="884021" linkType="Reference"&gt;884021&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2008, the CHMP recommended a further warning be added to the product information of epoetins stating that, in cancer patients, blood transfusion should be the preferred method for correcting anemia [&lt;ulink linkID="920794" linkType="Reference"&gt;920794&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Regulatory&gt;</value></Regulatory><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Anemia&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Adults&lt;/subtitle&gt;Data from 13 clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of epoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients (n = 1010) on dialysis were reported. An improvement in hemoglobin concentrations were achieved in 90% of epoetin alfa-treated patients.
