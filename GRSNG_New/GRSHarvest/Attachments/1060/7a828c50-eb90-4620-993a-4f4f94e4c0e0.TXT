The overall response rate (complete response /unconfirmed plus partial response) was 84.4% in the iv arm and 90.5% in the sc arm. In the iv and sc arms, stable disease was observed in 4.7 and 3.2% of patients, respectively. Progressive disease was observed in 1.6% of patients in the iv arm.

The overall response rate for those treated with B-R was similar to that associated with CHOP-R (94% versus 93%, respectively), and complete response was also similar at 51% for B-R compared to 40% for CHOP-R. The B-R regimen had a better toxicity profile, with a lower rate of total alopecia and infectious complications [&lt;ulink linkID="856660" linkType="Reference"&gt;856660&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2006, a phase III, open-label, randomized study (&lt;ulink linkID="66536" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01126541&lt;/ulink&gt;, ML19895, SMART) began to assess the efficacy and safety of retreatment with rituximab in RA patients (expected n = 224) who had failed anti-TNF alpha therapy in France.

Similar data were reported in May 2010. Continuation of rituximab for 2 years in patients who responded to initial treatment plus chemotherapy significantly increased PFS compared to patients who stopped treatment.

In November 2013, results from a six year follow-up of the PRIMA study was presented. PFS at six years was 42.7% in the observation arm (284 events, median = 48 months), and 59.2% in the rituximab maintenance arm (194 events, median not reached), after 73 months of follow-up (p &amp;lt; 0. 0001). Effect of rituximab maintenance was examined in pre-planned analyses of patients subgroups categorized by age, sex, FLIPI score category, induction chemotherapy and response to induction, and found to be consistent among these different subgroups. Rituximab maintenance (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), older age (p= 0.015), female sex (p = 0.0003) and low or intermediate FLIPI groups were significant variables associated with superior PFS, according to Cox regression multivariate analysis. Risk of starting a new anti-lymphoma treatment or starting a new chemotherapy was significantly reduced for rituximab maintenance. Rate of histological transformation was not different between two groups. Transformation was documented in 24 patients in observation arm (114 cases with morphological documentation out of 278 progressions), and 16 patients in the rituximab maintenance arm (80 out of 186). Overall response rate to second-line therapy was 79% in observation arm and 76% in rituximab maintenance arm (p = ns).

Of the 2738 patients enrolled in the NLCS study, 558, 247 and 121 patients received RCHOP, RCVP and RFlu, respectively. Compared with RCHOP and RFlu, a greater percentage of patients in the RCVP group had poor-risk FL International Prognostic Index (FLIPI). Maintenance rituximab was received by 60, 43 and 46% of patients in RCVP, RCHOP and RFlu groups, respectively. In the RCVP, RCHOP and RFlu groups, overall response rates were 88, 94 and 96%, respectively, and the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 72, 78 and 76%, respectively. After adjustments, there were no significant differences in PFS between treatments. Significant differences were observed in unadjusted overall survival (OS) with a median follow-up of 58 months, with two-year OS probabilities of 88, 91 and 94% for RCVP, RFlu and RCHOP groups, respectively.

The OR rate and CR rates were  91.2 and 71.6%, respectively. The OR and CR of DLBCL were 90.2 and 70.7%, respectively; and the OR and CR of indolent lymphoma (MALT, FL, and LPL) were 100 and 82.4%, respectively. The patients with lower (0 and 1) and higher (&amp;gt;2) IPI scores achieved CR and OR rates of 87.88 and 59.18%, and 100.00 and 83.67%, respectively. International prognosis index (IPI) scores showed significant impact on both CR and OR rate.

In the first study rituximab was tested as a first-line therapy in 20 adult patients with low-grade or follicular NHL, rather than in patients who had failed other therapies, which was the indication for which the drug was originally approved. Treatment was a standard course of 4 weekly infusions of rituximab at 375 mg/m2. An overall response rate of 50% was seen and the treatment was well tolerated. The side effect profile and response rate was similar to that seen when rituximab was administered after chemotherapy [&lt;ulink linkID="368064" linkType="Reference"&gt;368064&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Treatment of rituximab in 37 low-grade or refractory NHL patients who relapsed following autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) was also reported at ASCO 2000. The overall response rate to rituximab was high (62%) with 11% of patients having a complete response (CR) and 51% experiencing a partial response (PR). The authors proposed that rituximab may have clinical utility as part of ABMT regimens [&lt;ulink linkID="368066" linkType="Reference"&gt;368066&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, one presentation at the 36th ASCO reported the use of rituximab at a medical center for the time period between January 1998 to October 1999. Altogether, 63 patients were treated with rituximab as a single agent (low-grade/follicular NHL, intermediate and high-grade lymphoma, CLL and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD)), in combination with chemotherapy (low-grade/follicular NHL, intermediate and high grade lymphoma), or in pre/post bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Overall response rates for low-grade/follicular NHL, intermediate and high grade lymphoma, CLL and PTLD were 56% (10/18), 33% (4/12), 17% (1/6) and 100% (2/2), respectively. For low-grade/follicular NHL with chemotherapy, or intermediate and high-grade lymphoma with chemotherapy, the overall response was 100% (4/4) and 55% (6/11), respectively. Response rates for rituximab in pre/post BMT were not available at the time of presentation [&lt;ulink linkID="368142" linkType="Reference"&gt;368142&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A pilot phase II trial reported at the 35th ASCO meeting showed  combination chemotherapy with &lt;ulink linkID="6156" linkType="Drug"&gt;fludarabine&lt;/ulink&gt; demonstrates potent antitumor activity in patients with low grade/follicular NHL but does not appear active in transformed large cell NHL.

Of the first ten patients treated in a trial of rituximab used with fludarabine, seven had completed all therapy (six complete remissions and one partial remission) and three patients were taken off late in the study due to toxicity. The last eight patients were still on therapy. No serious or opportunistic infections had been observed and mean quantitative immunoglobulin levels and natural killer cell counts were preserved.

Patients with previously untreated aggressive B-cell NHL were treated. Of the 23 that had been enrolled by that time, 18 had completed treatment or had an interim evaluation. 12 patients had shown a CR, five an unconfirmed CR and one PR.

Two small phase II studies evaluating the combination of rituximab plus CHOP chemotherapy in patients with CD20-positive low-grade or follicular and intermediate- or high-grade NHL were presented. In the phase II low-grade NHL study, the overall response rate was 100% in 35 evaluable patients with 22 patients achieving CR and 13 patients achieving PR. The median duration of response was 39.7+ months with progression free survival not reached after a median observation time of 41.1+ months. Twenty-four patients were still in remission beyond 36+ months and up to 54.5+ months at this date. In the phase II intermediate- or high-grade NHL study, the overall response rate was 97% (32 of 33 patients), with 20 patients achieving CR and 12 patients achieving PR.

Patients who were treated with 1000 mg rituximab and MTX showed a significantly smaller change (0.359) in modified Total Sharp Score compared to patients on MTX alone (1.079), which demonstrated a lower progression of joint damage. In addition, a statistically significant higher number of patients who received rituximab and MTX had no progression in their joint damage over one year (64% versus 53% for MTX monotherapy). By week 52, 80% of these patients achieved ACR20, 65% achieved ACR50 and 47% had achieved ACR70, compared to 64, 42 and 25% on MTX alone, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1017229" linkType="Reference"&gt;1017229&lt;/ulink&gt;].

A significantly greater number of patients treated with two infusions of rituximab followed by MTX achieved  ACR 20, 50 and 70 response rates, compared with patients treated with placebo or MTX alone [&lt;ulink linkID="650687" linkType="Reference"&gt;650687&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2006, a phase II randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study  (&lt;ulink linkID="1647" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00298272&lt;/ulink&gt;; 102-RA-201) was initiated in the US to evaluate the tolerability and safety of rituximab (500 mg) when given in combination with MTX and &lt;ulink linkID="4567" linkType="Drug"&gt;etanercept&lt;/ulink&gt; or MTX and &lt;ulink linkID="14163" linkType="Drug"&gt;adalimumab&lt;/ulink&gt; in subjects (estimated n = 51) with active RA. The primary endpoint was to establish the proportion of patients with at least one serious infection at week 24.  By October 2008, enrollment had been  completed and the study was expected to be completed in November 2010 [&lt;ulink linkID="1027129" linkType="Reference"&gt;1027129&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2004, preliminary data were reported from the phase IIb DANCER study. The randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study had enrolled 465 patients with moderate-to-severe RA and was evaluating the efficacy and safety of varying doses of rituximab and glucocorticoids in combination with MTX, in patients who had failed prior treatment with one or more DMARDs, and were not responding adequately to MTX. The primary endpoint of the study was a greater proportion of rituximab-treated patients achieving an  ACR 20 response at week 24, compared with placebo. Nine groups of patients received a stable dosage of MTX and combinations of rituximab (placebo, 2 x 500 mg or 2 x 1000 mg, two weeks apart) and glucocorticoids (placebo, iv 200 mg, or iv 200 mg plus po 570 mg). Regardless of dose, it was indicated that rituximab provided clinically and statistically significant improvement in RA symptoms, compared with placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="568030" linkType="Reference"&gt;568030&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data was released in June 2005; in the two rituximab groups, 54 and 55% achieved ACR 20; 33 and 34% achieved ACR 50; and 13 and 20% achieved ACR 70, compared with 28, 13 and 5% for placebo, respectively. The improvement in response rates was shown to be independent of corticosteroids. Overall, rituximab was well tolerated with adverse events experienced being similar to those noted in earlier studies. Corticosteroid (iv) pre-medication appeared to reduce the incidence and severity of first infusion reactions but oral corticosteroids did not appear to provide any additional safety benefit [&lt;ulink linkID="606445" linkType="Reference"&gt;606445&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="606446" linkType="Reference"&gt;606446&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In a phase II trial, 37 patients with RA were repeatedly treated with rituximab over a five-year period. Half of the treated-patient group responded with an improvement in ACR score of 50 (0% in the control group), and 23% demonstrated an ACR70 improvement (0% in the control group). The average time of improvement was 15 months, with 42 months being the longest improvement time. Four rheumatoid factor seronegative patients did not respond to treatment, whereas almost all rheumatoid factor seropositive patients did. There were eight cases of lower respiratory episodes; however, none had a proven link to treatment. No patients showed any development of new forms of autoimmunity during the follow-up period [&lt;ulink linkID="546527" linkType="Reference"&gt;546527&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By March 2001, rituximab had entered phase II trials in RA [&lt;ulink linkID="421009" linkType="Reference"&gt;421009&lt;/ulink&gt;]; these were ongoing in January 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="441886" linkType="Reference"&gt;441886&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2002, the companies reported that preliminary results from the randomized, controlled, double-blind study evaluating rituximab alone or in combination therapy were positive [&lt;ulink linkID="455217" linkType="Reference"&gt;455217&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="458762" linkType="Reference"&gt;458762&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2002, preliminary positive interim results were reported from this phase II study of 161 patients with RA, all of whom were rheumatoid factor positive and receiving MTX but not responding. Patients were randomized into one of four treatment groups: MTX alone (at least 10 mg weekly); rituximab alone; rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide; and rituximab in combination with MTX (at least 10 mg weekly). Rituximab was administered as two iv infusions, with doses (1 g) given 2 weeks apart. Each group also received a course of iv and oral corticosteroids. Interim data was presented on the first 122 patients at 24 weeks. Of those receiving MTX alone, 33% experienced ACR20 responses, 10% experienced ACR50 responses and 0% experienced ACR70 responses. Of those patients receiving rituximab alone, 58% experienced ACR20 responses, 32% experienced ACR50 responses and 13% experienced ACR70 responses. In the group receiving rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, 84% of patients experienced ACR20 responses, 45% experienced ACR50 responses and 16% experienced ACR70 responses. Of those receiving rituximab plus MTX, 80% experienced ACR20 responses, 50% experienced ACR50 responses and 23% experienced ACR70 responses. Based on this data, the study's safety indicated that all three rituximab regimens were well tolerated with similar levels and type of adverse events occurring,  when compared with the MTX alone arm. The majority of events were infusion reactions of mild or moderate intensity [&lt;ulink linkID="468102" linkType="Reference"&gt;468102&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="470328" linkType="Reference"&gt;470328&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2003, 6-month results were presented from the phase IIa RA trial. The study was conducted in 161 RA patients, who had previously failed multiple disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and were responding inadequately to MTX. The randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study had 4 arms: MTX alone; rituximab alone; rituximab plus cyclophosphamide (CTX); and, rituximab plus MTX. Rituximab was given as two 1000 mg infusions, 2 weeks apart. 23% of patients who received the rituximab plus MTX combination reached an ACR 70, compared with 5% on MTX alone. In 43% of patients on rituximab and MTX, a 50% reduction of symptoms could be achieved, and in 76% of patients receiving rituximab plus CTX, symptoms could be reduced by 20% [&lt;ulink linkID="494357" linkType="Reference"&gt;494357&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2003, 48-week data was presented at the ACR meeting in Orlando, FL [&lt;ulink linkID="510381" linkType="Reference"&gt;510381&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2003, early results from this trial were presented at the 45th ASH meeting in San Diego, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="515859" linkType="Reference"&gt;515859&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further, positive efficacy and safety data regarding this trial was presented at the SMi conference on Advances in Anti-Arthritic Agents, London, UK in April 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="535943" linkType="Reference"&gt;535943&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="544929" linkType="Reference"&gt;544929&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2005, two year data from this trial were presented at the Anti-Arthritis Therapies Conference in London, UK. ACR20, 50 and 70 response rates were, respectively: 13, 10 and 8% (MTX); 8, 8 and 3% (rituximab); 13, 10 and 8% (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide); and 33, 20 and 10% (rituximab plus MTX). Continuous ACR70 &amp;gt; 6 months and mean duration of ACR70 response were,  respectively: 0%, 33 days (MTX); 5%, 74 days (rituximab); 2%, 97 days (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide); and 13%, 109 days (rituximab plus MTX). Patients with clinically meaningful Health Assessment Questionnaire scores after two years were 23%, 33%, 27% and 45%, respectively. Decreased levels of both C-reactive protein  and rheumatoid factor were maintained over the two-year period with no serious adverse events [&lt;ulink linkID="587262" linkType="Reference"&gt;587262&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2012, a prospective, multi-center, observational study (&lt;ulink linkID="87222" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT01592292&lt;/ulink&gt;; ML27923) was initiated in Korea, in patients (n = 90) who were intolerant to  anti-TNF alpha therapy, to evaluate the efficacy and  safety of rituximab.

According to 6-month urine protein to creatinine ratio of &amp;gt; 1 g/g and &amp;lt; 1 g/g, and in overall population (n = 274, 246 and 520 patients, respectively), after 18 months complete renal response (CRR) was achieved by 36, 166 and 202 patients, respectively; CRR was not achieved by 238, 80 and 318 patients, respectively. From baseline to month 3 and from month 3 to 6, patients exhibited an increase in AUC with values of 0.64, 0.80 and 0.84 at baseline, month 3 and 6, respectively (p  &amp;lt; 0.001); while beyond month 6, no increase was observed in AUC (p &amp;gt; 0.05 for each pairwise comparison) [&lt;ulink linkID="1935572" linkType="Reference"&gt;1935572&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2006, an interventional, treatment, phase III extension trial (&lt;ulink linkID="11315" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00404157&lt;/ulink&gt;; U3388g) was planned in patients (expected n = 140) with ISN/RPS  class III or IV lupus nephritis previously enrolled in the LUNAR study. However, by January 2008, the trial had been withdrawn prior to recruitment [&lt;ulink linkID="1262931" linkType="Reference"&gt;1262931&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2006, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III trial (&lt;ulink linkID="11173" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00282347&lt;/ulink&gt;; U2970g; LUNAR) was initiated in subjects (expected n = 140) with ISN/RPS class III or IV lupus nephritis in the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. Patients were to receive rituximab in combination with &lt;ulink linkID="3669" linkType="Drug"&gt;MMF&lt;/ulink&gt;  compared with placebo in combination with MMF. The primary endpoint was establishing the proportion of subjects who achieved a renal response [&lt;ulink linkID="872769" linkType="Reference"&gt;872769&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2009, initial data were reported showing that  rituximab plus MMF had failed to meet its primary endpoint of reducing disease activity at 52 weeks. The incidence of overall adverse events and serious adverse events were comparable between the rituximab and placebo groups, however, side effects such as leukopenia, neutropenia and hypotension were more frequent in the rituximab arm (12.3, 5.5 and 11% in the rituximab arm vs 4.2, 1.4 and 4.2% in the placebo arm, respectively). At that time, the company planned to fully analyze  the data  including long-term safety data [&lt;ulink linkID="991133" linkType="Reference"&gt;991133&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2009, further data were presented at the ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting n Philadelphia, PA. A total of 144 paitents were included in the intent-to-treat group. Renal response did not differ significantly in patients receiving rituximab compared with placebo [&lt;ulink linkID="1262917" linkType="Reference"&gt;1262917&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2010, similar data were reported. Of 72 patients enrolled, the number of patients receiving rituximab who achieved a complete renal response were 19, compared to 22 for placebo; a partial renal response was seen in 22 and 11, respectively; and no response were 31 and 39, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="872769" linkType="Reference"&gt;872769&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2017, further clinical data were presented at the ASN's Kidney Week 2017 in New Orleans, LA. In rituximab and placebo groups, the median BAFF levels were peaked at week 28; the mean increase in BAFF levels from baseline to week 28 were + 4940 (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and +1674 pg/ml, (p &amp;lt; 0.001), respectively. In rituximab group, 36% of patients had B-cell recovery at week 78. Median anti-dsDNA levels observed at week 78 were comparable in the B-cell recovery group compared to patients without recovery (42 versus 24 IU/ml, respectively, p = 0.8). At week 78, rituximab treated patients had significantly lower median anti-dsDNA levels than placebo patients (37 versus 66 IU/ml, respectively, p = 0.03) [&lt;ulink linkID="1977747" linkType="Reference"&gt;1977747&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2007, a non-randomized, open-label, single-group, phase II study (&lt;ulink linkID="20885" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00475423&lt;/ulink&gt;; ML20948) began in Australia to assess the safety and efficacy of a fixed dose (1000 mg) of rituximab in patients with refractory, relapsing or chronic ITP (expected n = 108).

In December 2011, data from the study (also known as R-ITP1000) were presented at the 53rd ASH meeting in San Diego, CA. At weeks 8 and 12, 43.5 and 45.5% of patients respectively were classified as responders. A complete response (CR) was observed in 9.3 and 12.1% of patients, and a partial response (PR) was observed in 34.3 and 33.3% of patients at weeks 8 and 12, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1242125" linkType="Reference"&gt;1242125&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2012, further data  were presented at the 17th EHA Annual Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Of 124 enrolled patients, 122 received scheduled rituximab dose  and were followed-up for at least 12 weeks. At week 8, the objective response rate (primary endpoint) was 44% (n = 108). At weeks 26 and 52, therapeutic response was achieved by 47 and 38 patients, respectively. At week 8, 10 patients showed CR, 47 showed CR + PR, and 66 patients showed CR + PR + minimal response. A total of 54 patients had new ITP therapy, and the median time to new therapy was 314 days.

In June 2011, results from this pilot trial were presented at the 16th EHA meeting in London, UK. Objectives were to determine the feasibility of recruitment, protocol adherence, and blinding in a randomized trial of rituximab in ITP, and to evaluate effects of rituximab on any of platelet count, significant bleeding, or rescue treatment after discontinuation of standard-of -care treatment. Patients received rituximab (n = 33) at 375 mg/m2 iv in saline infusion once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks, or saline placebo (n = 27). Two patients (one in each group) were lost to follow-up before receiving an infusion.  The direction of effect favored rituximab, however there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for composite outcome or its components (platelet count, bleeding, rescue treatment). It was concluded that the feasibility of a large-scale, randomized clinical trial was uncertain, as the rate of accrual was slower than expected and there was a high rate of patient refusals (42.1%). Furthermore, there had been a significant increase in the off-label use of rituximab to treat ITP [&lt;ulink linkID="1198092" linkType="Reference"&gt;1198092&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2005,  data were presented at the 47th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA. Rituximab was administered iv at a dose of 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks. In total, 33 of 34 patients (17 patients with ITP, 6 AIN, 2 AIHA, 2 PRCA, 4 AIHA and ITP (Evan's syndrome), 1 AIHA and AIN, 1 PRCA and ITP, and 1 AIN and ITP) completed treatment. In one patient, treatment was discontinued after 3 infusions due to a hypotensive syncopal episode. No other major infusion-related adverse reactions were observed. Responses were demonstrated in 9 of 17 patients with ITP, 2 of 2 patients with AIHA and 4 of 4 patients with AIHA and ITP.

Initially a murine monoclonal antibody was raised by immunizing mice with the human lymphoblastoid cell line SB, and isolating CD20-specific antibodies using conventional hybridoma technology [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206647"&gt;206647&lt;/ulink&gt;]. 2B8 was identified as the antibody with the highest degree of reactivity to CD20 by radioimmunoassay. The genes for the variable regions of 2B8 were cloned by polymerase chain reaction from cDNA which was produced from RNA isolated from the 2B8-producing hybridoma cell line. The light chain variable region gene was then fused to the human kappa light chain constant region gene and the heavy chain variable region gene to sequences encoding human IgG1 constant regions. The resulting chimeric genes were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells resulting in the production of the mouse:human chimeric antibody, C2B8 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206647"&gt;206647&lt;/ulink&gt;]. CHO cell lines expressing high levels of C2B8 were isolated by gene amplification and the C2B8 could be readily purified by protein-A affinity chromatography. The resultant C2B8 therefore contains the CD20 binding specificity of the original murine antibody, 2B8 and has the ability to activate human effector functions through the human constant regions. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;IDEC-C2B8 was shown in in vitro assays to bind human C1q and to be capable of mediating efficient complement-dependent cell lysis of cells presenting the CD20 antigen in the presence of human complement. Also antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of CD20 positive target cells could be induced in the presence of human effector cells. These effects were specific and not exhibited by the murine antibody or a non-specific human IgG1 control [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206647"&gt;206647&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Antibodies to CD20 have been shown to be able to induce transmembrane cell signaling events [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="212278"&gt;212278&lt;/ulink&gt;] and IDEC-C2B8 is also able to induce apoptosis of CD20 positive cells via such an event [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206615"&gt;206615&lt;/ulink&gt;]. All of these properties may be important in explaining the mechanism of action of IDEC-C2B8 in vivo. Additionally IDEC-C2B8 can sensitize resistant lymphoma cells to certain cytotoxic drugs which may lead to synergistic effects in combination therapy protocols [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206615"&gt;206615&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In cynomolgus monkeys dosed with 1.6 to 6.4 mg/kg, normal B-cells were depleted by 98% in peripheral blood and 40 to 70% in lymph nodes, demonstrating specific B-cell killing. Importantly, stem cells were not affected and B-cells began to recover after 2 weeks, although 2-3 months were required to regain normal levels [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206647"&gt;206647&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At four weekly doses of 16.8 mg/kg B-cells were reduced by up to 95% in lymph nodes and bone marrow as well as effectively removing B-cells from peripheral blood. Other cell types were apparently unaffected.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;In common with most chimeric antibodies examined in humans IDEC-C2B8 has a long serum half-life. In a phase I study a mean half-life of 4.4 days was reported (range 1.5 to 10.5 days) when &amp;gt; 100 mg/m2 was administered. The half-life is dependent on the amount of antigen present, which can vary widely in patients with differing tumor burdens, and is therefore expected to be longer when enough antibody is administered to saturate all the available antigen [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206642"&gt;206642&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Immune responses to IDEC-C2B8 have not been detected, consistent with the expectation that depletion of B-cells is immunosuppressive.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;In cynomolgus monkeys no toxic effects were seen with four weekly doses of 16.8 mg/kg except depletion of B-cells which was used as a sign of efficacy [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206647"&gt;206647&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In clinical studies to date the antibody has been well-tolerated with only mild to moderate associated toxicity. This is encouraging with respect to competitor products in development which use radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibody resulting in severe hematologic toxicity requiring autologous bone marrow support [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206648"&gt;206648&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;An escalating single dose study was carried out at 10, 50, 100, 250 and 500 mg/m2 in 15 patients, three per dose group, with relapsed non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="206642"&gt;206642&lt;/ulink&gt;]. No dose-limiting toxicity was identified. Adverse effects on administration were correlated with the number of CD20 positive cells present and the destruction of these cells may be responsible for the mild and moderate toxicities observed. These included fever, nausea, rigor, othostatic hypotension, bronchospasm and thrombocytopenia. No significant toxicity was seen during the 3 month follow-up.  Tumor regression was observed in 6 patients comprising two partial and four minor responses.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In phase II studies IDEC-C2B8 has been evaluated both as a single agent and in combination with conventional chemotherapy. A single agent phase II study carried out in patients with low grade or follicular lymphoma with four weekly doses of IDEC-C2B8 at 375 mg/m2, resulted in tumor shrinkage in 22 of 34 evaluable patients with complete or partial tumor responses in 17 patients [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="193897"&gt;193897&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The treatment was well tolerated on an outpatient basis, and five patients had remissions of &amp;gt; 20 months [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="201459"&gt;201459&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A second phase II trial examining the use of IDEC-C2B8 in combination with CHOP chemotherapy in patients with low grade B-cell lymphoma is ongoing. CHOP chemotherapy comprises of a standard regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone. Six doses of 375 mg/m2 IDEC-C2B8 administered alternately with six doses of CHOP chemotherapy over 21 weeks were administered [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="193900"&gt;193900&lt;/ulink&gt;]. All of the patients which have undergone the full treatment to date have responded with 28 of 29 responses ongoing from 6 to 22 months [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="201459"&gt;201459&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Of the 29 patients analyzed, 19 complete and 10 partial responses were achieved. The malignant cell marker Bcl-2 was detected in seven patients prior to therapy and only one afterwards. Adverse events were mostly related to chemotherapy (77%), the most frequent being alopecia, nausea, vomiting, constipation and thrombocytopenia. Nine grade IV and 22 grade III adverse events were all thought to be related to chemotherapy.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase III&lt;/subtitle&gt;Enrolment of 166 patients has been completed in a pivotal phase III trial of IDEC-C2B8 as a single agent treatment for relapsed low grade or follicular lymphoma [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="200788"&gt;200788&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Preliminary analysis of the first 50 patients has been presented [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="210486"&gt;210486&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A similar response rate was seen to the phase II trial with 23 responses from 48 evaluable patients (47%), comprising six complete and 17 partial responses. In addition of 16 Bcl-2 positive patients analyzed the tumor marker reverted to negative in the blood of 12 and in the bone marrow of six of these 12 patients. Conventional chemotherapy does not usually achieve Bcl-2 negative status in the bone marrow.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;IDEC-C2B8 is very well tolerated compared to conventional chemotherapy treatment for NHL. In the single agent phase II study, 6% of adverse events were grade III (rigors, thrombocytopenia, anemia, bronchospasm) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="193897"&gt;193897&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Normal B-cells were depleted as expected and required 5 to 7 months for recovery, resulting in immunosuppression. To date this has been well managed and is not expected to cause severe difficulties in the use of IDEC-C2B8.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Although results of the phase III trial are still being analyzed the prospects for IDEC-C2B8 look positive. Antitumor effects in the phase II trials look impressive compared to conventional treatment alone, and for tumor therapeutics it is extremely well tolerated. As the toxicity of IDEC-C2B8 does not overlap with the toxicity of chemotherapy and there is some evidence for synergistic effects, it is likely that IDEC-C2B8 will find a place in combination with standard chemotherapy treatment. Competing anti-CD20 antibodies are being developed as murine antibodies without the ability to interact directly with the human immune system and are therefore being attached to toxic cell killing agents such as radioisotopes. Single agent results with such competitor products have been more impressive than IDEC-C2B8 but at the cost of greatly increased toxicity and more complicated and expensive use. In this regard it is notable that IDEC are following up C2B8 with their own radiolabeled version for the treatment of bulkier, later stage and more refractory tumors [&lt;ulink linkType="reference"
