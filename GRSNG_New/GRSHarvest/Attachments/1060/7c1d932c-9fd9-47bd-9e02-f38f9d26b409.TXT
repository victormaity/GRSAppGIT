In April 2005, the company started a phase I trial of HE-2100 for radiation sickness in the Netherlands [&lt;ulink linkID="592852" linkType="Reference"&gt;592852&lt;/ulink&gt;]; US phase I trial was started in the third quarter of 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="632376" linkType="Reference"&gt;632376&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In June 2006, HE-2100 was cleared by the FDA to start a phase I trial in patients at high risk of developing hospital-acquired infections [&lt;ulink linkID="672633" linkType="Reference"&gt;672633&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in March 2007, Hollis-Eden discontinued development of the drug, following the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)' rejection of the drug as a radioprotectant. At that time, the company  reported that it would reconsider its decision if the Department of Defence (DoD) improved  HE-2100's chances in the very short term and  was also considering seeking to outlicense  the compound  for further development [&lt;ulink linkID="772356" linkType="Reference"&gt;772356&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="775447" linkType="Reference"&gt;775447&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Hollis-Eden was previously investigating HE-3204, a second-generation analog of HE-2100, and by June 2004, both HE-2100 and HE-3204 were being tested in parallel studies for use in chemotherapy- and radiation-induced myelosuppression, with a clinical candidate likely to be determined from toxicity studies. Third-generation analogs were also being investigated [&lt;ulink linkID="542449" linkType="reference"&gt;542449&lt;/ulink&gt;]. But by April 2005, HE-2100 had been taken into phase I studies as a lead clinical candidate [&lt;ulink linkID="592852" linkType="Reference"&gt;592852&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Since 2000, no development has been reported for the potential treatment of cancer, although HE-2100 had been investigated for this indication [&lt;ulink linkID="391886" linkType="reference"&gt;391886&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Summary&gt;</value></Summary><PatentsAndGenerics><displayLabel>Patents and Generics</displayLabel><value>&lt;PatentsAndGenerics&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2002, Hollis-Eden received notice from the European Patent Office of the issue of claims that covered the company's anti-radiation and chemotherapy protection drug candidates, HE-2100 and &lt;ulink linkID="30771" linkType="Drug"&gt;HE-2200&lt;/ulink&gt;. The patent was granted to the &lt;ulink linkID="20696" linkType="Company"&gt;Virginia Commonwealth University&lt;/ulink&gt; which had licensed worldwide rights to HE-2100 and HE-2200 exclusively to Hollis-Eden. The claims covered the use of HE-2100 to treat or prevent the side effects of radiation exposure [&lt;ulink linkID="474608" linkType="reference"&gt;474608&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2003, Hollis-Eden received notice from the JPO that a patent had been issued in Japan covering HE-2100 and HE-2200. The claim covered a broad array of uses for the compounds related to enhancing immune responses and specifically included the use of HE-2100 and HE-2200 for preventing or ameliorating the immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy or radiation exposure [&lt;ulink linkID="477309" linkType="reference"&gt;477309&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/PatentsAndGenerics&gt;</value></PatentsAndGenerics><Regulatory><displayLabel>Regulatory</displayLabel><value>&lt;Regulatory&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2002, it was reported that HE-2100 could be approved as a radioprotectant between 2003 and 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="445762" linkType="reference"&gt;445762&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In April 2003, Hollis-Eden anticipated applying for approval of HE-2100 for radioprotection in 2004 [&lt;ulink linkID="484861" linkType="reference"&gt;484861&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2003, Hollis-Eden revealed that under a new FDA rule, phase II/III studies would not be required for the radioprotection indication, due to the nature of the indication, and a pivotal animal efficacy study would be sufficient instead. The FDA's animal efficacy rule allows approval to be granted on the demonstration of efficacy in animals and successful completion of phase I safety trials in humans, as it would be unethical to conduct efficacy studies in humans [&lt;ulink linkID="495540" linkType="reference"&gt;495540&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="494082" linkType="reference"&gt;494082&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="592852" linkType="Reference"&gt;592852&lt;/ulink&gt;],  [&lt;ulink linkID="611057" linkType="Reference"&gt;611057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2004, Hollis-Eden expected to  file an NDA under the animal efficacy rule in 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="577173" linkType="Reference"&gt;577173&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2006, an IND was filed to start phase I trials in patients at high risk of developing hospital-acquired infections [&lt;ulink linkID="665368" linkType="Reference"&gt;665368&lt;/ulink&gt;].  In June 2006, HE-2100 was cleared by the FDA to start a phase I trial in patients at high risk of developing hospital-acquired infections [&lt;ulink linkID="672633" linkType="Reference"&gt;672633&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Regulatory&gt;</value></Regulatory><Premarketing><displayLabel>Premarketing</displayLabel><value>&lt;Premarketing&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Immune stimulant for protection against infections&lt;/subtitle&gt;In May 2006, phase I trials of HE-2100 in patients at high risk of developing hospital-acquired infections were to begin [&lt;ulink linkID="665368" linkType="Reference"&gt;665368&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2006, the FDA gave clearance for the trial to begin [&lt;ulink linkID="672633" linkType="Reference"&gt;672633&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Acute radiation syndrome&lt;/subtitle&gt;In April 2005, the company started a phase I trial for acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in the Netherlands. The study would determine the concentration of HE-2100 that could be achieved in human blood. This information would be used to select the final dose for a pivotal efficacy study in non-human primates [&lt;ulink linkID="592852" linkType="Reference"&gt;592852&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The FDA approved a similar US study in July 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="611057" linkType="Reference"&gt;611057&lt;/ulink&gt;]. This trial was started in the third quarter of 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="632376" linkType="Reference"&gt;632376&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In October 2005, the company reported preliminary results at the 47th Annual Meeting of The American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology in Denver, CO, showing that the drug was safe, well tolerated, and caused dose-dependent increases in neutrophil and platelet levels in healthy volunteers [&lt;ulink linkID="629229" linkType="Reference"&gt;629229&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further data were reported in October 2006 at the 44th Meeting of the Infectious Disease Society of America in Toronto, Canada. The double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose trial recruited 18 patients  who recieved im injections of 200 mg of the drug for 5 days. HE-2100 was well tolerated and injection-site reactions were mild-to-moderate. Neutrophil and platelet counts were increased for up to 28 days and comparable to those seen in preclincial trials [&lt;ulink linkID="730986" linkType="Reference"&gt;730986&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="768580" linkType="Reference"&gt;768580&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Myelosuppression&lt;/subtitle&gt;In February 2007, preclinical data published in International Immunopharmacology demonstrated HE-2100 improved survival in clinically unsupported rhesus monkeys with radiation-induced myelosuppression. A total of 80 rhesus monkeys' were exposed to 600 cGy of total body irradiation and treated with intramuscular HE-2100 after 4 h over 5 days. In the placebo group, 32.5% of animals died compared with only 12.5% of HE-2100 treated animals. A reduction in the number of days of severe neutropenia and severe thrombocytopenia was also observed. Monkeys exposed to 400 cGy of radiation also found protection with HE-2100 treatment [&lt;ulink linkID="768718" linkType="Reference"&gt;768718&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="768580" linkType="Reference"&gt;768580&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2005, an overview of preclinical results obtained thus far was presented at  the 47th Annual Meeting of The American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology in Denver, CO. It was also reported that the drug  had been found to raise levels of bone marrow CD34+ cells by 100-fold compared to placebo in preclinical studies [&lt;ulink linkID="629229" linkType="Reference"&gt;629229&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2004, preclinical data on IRHs were presented at the Fourth International Congress on Autoimmune Diseases in Budapest, Hungary. Effects were seen with IRHs in in vivo models of lung inflammation,  multiple sclerosis and endotoxic shock. In addition to these anti-inflammatory properties, IRHs were shown to improve immune function  in a popliteal lymph node assay and were also shown to counteract corticosteroid-induced changes responsible for bone loss in in vitro studies [&lt;ulink linkID="568845" linkType="Reference"&gt;568845&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;According to data presented in October 2004, at the 46th Annual Meeting of The American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) in Atlanta, GA,  HE-2100  increased non-human primate survival-rate after high-dose radiation exposure. In total, 30 Rhesus macaques received a dose of radiation that 50% of untreated animals could survive. The animals received no treatment, placebo, or HE-2100 after radiation exposure. HE-2100 increased survival from 55% to 98%, improved thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia and was well tolerated. Localized swelling was observed but appeared to have no clinical consequence. Normal bone marrow function was recovered by the end of the observation period in all surviving animals. At that time, Hollis-Eden planned to determine a minimum effective dose in future studies, and to initiate pivotal studies within the following few months, pending FDA feedback [&lt;ulink linkID="562345" linkType="Reference"&gt;562345&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar data were also presented in December 2004, at the 46th ASH meeting in San Diego, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="572652" linkType="Reference"&gt;572652&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Simillar data were presented at the 35th Annual Scientific Meeting of the International Society for Experimental Hematology in Minneapolis, MN. Treated rhesus monkeys exposed to 6 Gy total body irradiation experienced a median 40-fold increase in CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells when compared with placebo-treated animals. The drug also stimulated multilineage hematopoiesis in unirradiated humans and improved survival in lethally irradiated monkeys [&lt;ulink linkID="720784" linkType="Reference"&gt;720784&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2004, preclinical data for HE-2100 and HE-3204 were presented at the 40th ASCO meeting in New Orleans, LA. Rhesus macaques were administered &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt; (35 mg/kg) 36 h before receiving either HE-2100 or HE-3204, or were administered a sublethal dose of total body irradiation 2 to 4 hours before receiving either of the hormones. HE-2100 and HE-3204 were administered five times a day, by sc injection. HE-2100 acted directly on both primitive and mature progenitor cells to increase multilinage hematopoiesis, and high doses reduced incidences of severe neutropenia from 7 days (vehicle) to 2 days in irradiated macaques, and from 5.3 to 0.7 days in carboplatin treated macaques. HE-3204 had greater potency than HE-2100 in stimulating recovery from myelosuppression in the blood cells measured (neutrophils, platelets and erythrocytes), and was found to completely eliminate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (5.3 to 0 days) [&lt;ulink linkID="542449" linkType="reference"&gt;542449&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="541162" linkType="reference"&gt;541162&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In December 2003, preclinical data on HE-2100 were presented at the 45th ASH meeting in San Diego, CA. Non-human primates were exposed to sublethal total-body gamma irradiation. HE-2100 was given sc as 8 (high dose) or 10 (medium and low dose) daily doses beginning 2 to 4 h after irradiation. Mean grade 4 neutropenic days were reduced from 7 days (vehicle) to 2 days following HE-2100 administration at the highest dose. HE-2100 treatment at the medium and low doses also resulted in reductions to 4 and 3 mean neutropenic days, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="516015" linkType="reference"&gt;516015&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="516507" linkType="reference"&gt;516507&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2003, preliminary results from a pilot study of HE-2100 in radiation-exposed non-human primates were presented at the 43rd Annual Scientific Meeting of the British Society For Hematology, in Glasgow, Scotland. HE-2100, administered 24 h before, or 2 to 4 h after, exposure to 400 cGy of radiation, resulted in a reduction in the occurrence of severe neutropenia, compared to control animals. Three weeks after radiation, the average percentage of days of severe neutropenia was 47% for the control group compared to 17% for a group receiving HE-2100 before radiation and 11% for the group treated with HE-2100 after radiation exposure [&lt;ulink linkID="484861" linkType="reference"&gt;484861&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By April 2003, preclinical studies in mice had shown that HE-2100, when given to animals shortly before or shortly after exposure to lethal doses of radiation, provided significant survival advantages versus placebo-treated animals. In the study, 100% of animals treated with HE-2100 24 h prior to exposure to 900 cGy of radiation survived compared to 100% mortality in the group receiving no drug [&lt;ulink linkID="484861" linkType="reference"&gt;484861&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2002, data were presented at the Radiation Research Society Meeting in Reno, NV. Results from a preclinical study showed that HE-2100 stimulated the innate immune system and key immune cells involved in elimination of infectious pathogens. HE-2100, when given to animals prior to exposure to lethal doses of radiation, stimulated the production of granulocytes, monocytes and NK cells. HE-2100 also enhanced the ability of granulocytes to eliminate pathogens and the ability of monocytes to destroy pathogens [&lt;ulink linkID="448816" linkType="reference"&gt;448816&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By December 2000, HE-2100 had been shown to increase significantly survival in mice given a lethal dose of radiation (70% versus 0%) and in irradiated mice infected with coxsackie virus (88% versus 50%). In another experiment, animals were sublethally irradiated, then exposed to Klebsiella pneumoniae. HE-2100 treatment either 24 h before or 2 h after irradiation significantly increased survival (90% versus 15%) [&lt;ulink linkID="391983" linkType="reference"&gt;391983&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="438353" linkType="reference"&gt;438353&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2002, Hollis-Eden reported results from a study in Macaque monkeys, at the Symposium on Immune Therapy at the Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand. the data demonstrated the significant protection afforded by HE-2100 to animals exposed to chemotherapy. In this study, macaques were administered a dose of &lt;ulink linkID="44383" linkType="Drug"&gt;carboplatin&lt;/ulink&gt;, and were given placebo, HE-2100 or &lt;ulink linkID="30771" linkType="Drug"&gt;HE-2200&lt;/ulink&gt;  qd over 10 days. The primary endpoint of the study was the total number of observations of neutropenia (less than 1200 neutrophils/microl) during the 20-day study period. In the placebo-treated group, animals were neutropenic for 41% of the observations. In contrast, HE-2100 showed significant improvement in the number of observations of neutropenia, with HE-2100-treated animals showing 0% neutropenia during the entire 20-day observation period. HE-2100 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. The secondary endpoint was the effect on preserving platelets after administration of carboplatin. Platelets in the placebo group fell to an average 76% below the baseline value before beginning to recover. PLatelets in HE-2100-treated animals fell on average to 28% below the baseline value before beginning to recover. In addition, animals treated with HE-2100 demonstrated a significant preservation of platelets when compared to placebo-treated animals [&lt;ulink linkID="470970" linkType="reference"&gt;470970&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2003, similar data were presented at the 45th ASH meeting in San Diego, CA [&lt;ulink linkID="516893" linkType="reference"&gt;516893&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Cancer&lt;/subtitle&gt;In December 2005, preclinical data on HE-2100 were presented at the 47th ASH meeting in Atlanta, GA. Total body irradiation  resulted in profound pancytopenia in rhesus monkeys; however, treatment with 15 mg/kg HE-2100 im for 5 consecutive days starting 2 h post irradiation reduced the period of severe neutropenia from 20.8 days in placebo-treated animals to 12.8 days. Recovery of reticulocytes in the HE-2100 group occurred by day 18.8, whereas control monkeys did not reach this level until day 26.3. Only one transfusion was needed in the HE-2200-treated group to maintain platelets at the high threshold level as opposed to four in the control group. There was accelerated recovery of immature bone marrow cells in HE-2100-treated monkeys such that levels of CD34+ cells in bone marrow were up to 2 log greater than in that of controls 2 weeks after irradiation. Direct local or systemic toxic effects were not observed during administration of the steroid, but HE-2100-treated monkeys displayed a average increase of 10% in bodyweight due to fluid retention starting 2 weeks after irradiation, resulting in transient edema [&lt;ulink linkID="640841" linkType="Reference"&gt;640841&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Further data were presented at ASH 2005 in Atlanta, GA, from a meta-analysis of 5 studies involving 100 animals receiving total body irradiation. Animals were either untreated, given vehicle or 5 to 15 mg/kg of HE-2100 im for 5 consecutive days starting 2 to 3 h after irradiation. HE-2100 protected animals from lethal irradiation, significantly decreasing the lethality overall from 42% in the control group to 22% in the HE-2100-treated group. The majority of animals (28 of 32) died by day 20 of acute radiation sickness. No cytopenias were recorded after day 26 on surviving animals [&lt;ulink linkID="639868" linkType="Reference"&gt;639868&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By November 2000, HE-2100 was shown to mediate apoptosis in vitro in human myeloid tumor cells and to reduce proliferation of human breast cancer cells, regardless of whether the line was positive or negative for estrogen receptors [&lt;ulink linkID="391886" linkType="reference"&gt;391886&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Inflammation&lt;/subtitle&gt;According to data presented in April 2005 at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology 2005 meeting in San Diego, CA, Hollis-Eden's second-generation IRHs increased survival and reduced inflammation compared to placebo, in preclinical models of acute lung inflammation, septic shock and multiple sclerosis. The compounds were effective at doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mg, as compared to the 3 to 6 mg doses previously required to see benefit using first-generation compounds. Activity was on a par with that of antiTNF alpha therapy. The data suggested that the compounds were more metabolically stable than the parent compounds [&lt;ulink linkID="593501" linkType="Reference"&gt;593501&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Preclinical&gt;</value></Preclinical><AdditionalInformation><displayLabel>Additional Information</displayLabel><value>&lt;AdditionalInformation&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2006, Hollis-Eden put HE-2100 forward in response to a notice from the DOD seeking medical radiation countermeasures that could be developed quickly to protect against radiation injury, specifically neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or the gastrointestinal syndrome associated with acute radiation injury. The DOD was also to issue a Request for Proposal covering medical radiation countermeasures, and had encouraged the company to respond [&lt;ulink linkID="647806" linkType="Reference"&gt;647806&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In February 2006, the company responded to the  &lt;ulink linkID="20518" linkType="Company"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/ulink&gt;  (DHHS) with a proposal [&lt;ulink linkID="652241" linkType="Reference"&gt;652241&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2006, the company was informed that it was within the competitive range for discussion with regard to this proposal [&lt;ulink linkID="675691" linkType="Reference"&gt;675691&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2006, Hollis-Eden granted an extension of its offer to the DHHS. Since June 2006, Hollis-Eden had been in ongoing discussions with DHHS with respect to this potential procurement. At that time, the government had not provided Hollis-Eden with a new estimated contract award date, but based on this extension an award could be made by the end of November 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="694255" linkType="Reference"&gt;694255&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In November 2006, the DHHS indicated that after receipt of the company's final  revisions, the government had  numerous steps to complete internally before awarding the contract, but expected this to occurr  by January 31, 2007 [&lt;ulink linkID="738735" linkType="Reference"&gt;738735&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In January 2007, the DHHS informed Hollis-Eden that it had revised its estimated planned contract award data to March 07, 2007 [&lt;ulink linkID="762538" linkType="Reference"&gt;762538&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In March 2007, the DHHS rejected HE-2100 as a radioprotectant, indicating that it was technically unacceptable and no longer met the competitive range with regard to the proposal [&lt;ulink linkID="772356" linkType="Reference"&gt;772356&lt;/ulink&gt;]; later that month, following a meeting with the company, the HHS specified that the compound was promising and met mandatory requirements, but the amount of data available was not sufficient. Hollis-Eden believed  these issues could only be met by pivotal safety and efficacy trials, which it was not prepared to fund in the absence of an advance purchase contract and therefore, discontinued the drug's development. At that time, the company stated that it would reconsider its  decision   if  the DoD improved the opportunities for HE-2100 in the very short term and that it was also considering licensing or selling the compound to third parties for further development [&lt;ulink linkID="775447" linkType="Reference"&gt;775447&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In September 2005, DHHS  issued a statement of work  to Hollis-Eden  covering therapeutics for neutropenia associated with ARS [&lt;ulink linkID="626279" linkType="Reference"&gt;626279&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By December 2004, Hollis-Eden had begun manufacturing scale-up activities for HE-2100 [&lt;ulink linkID="577173" linkType="Reference"&gt;577173&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2004, Hollis-Eden planned to respond before December 20, 2004 to a request for information from the Department of Health and Human Services regarding therapeutics to treat neutropenia and thrombocytopenia associated with acute radiation syndrome [&lt;ulink linkID="566384" linkType="Reference"&gt;566384&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="577173" linkType="Reference"&gt;577173&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In January 2003, Hollis-Eden announced that it would provide its investigational immune regulating hormone drug candidates, &lt;ulink linkID="19980" linkType="Drug"&gt;HE-2000&lt;/ulink&gt;  and HE-2100, to the &lt;ulink linkID="21129" linkType="Company"&gt;Walter Reed Army Institute of Research&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkID="21129" linkType="Company"&gt;WRAIR&lt;/ulink&gt;) to be tested for activity in preclinical models against a variety of bioterrorism agents as well as parasitic, bacterial and viral infections of military interest. The compounds were expected to be evaluated by the military either alone or in combination with currently used drugs. In addition, the compounds were to be assessed for their effectiveness in enhancing vaccines being developed by &lt;ulink linkID="21129" linkType="Company"&gt;WRAIR&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkID="476153" linkType="reference"&gt;476153&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By 2002, A CRADA had been established between Hollis-Eden and the AFRRI to develop HE-2100 as a radioprotectant [&lt;ulink linkID="441458" linkType="reference"&gt;441458&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="445762" linkType="reference"&gt;445762&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="451195" linkType="reference"&gt;451195&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="471158" linkType="reference"&gt;471158&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/AdditionalInformation&gt;</value></AdditionalInformation></DevelopmentProfile><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company
