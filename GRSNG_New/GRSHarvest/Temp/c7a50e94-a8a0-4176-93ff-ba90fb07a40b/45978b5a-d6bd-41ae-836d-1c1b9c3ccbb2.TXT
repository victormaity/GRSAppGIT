Patients often experience pain on eye movement. These optic disturbances, classified as optic neuritis, occur in 55% of patients at some point in the disease course (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1545862", "name": "Green, A.J. et al  (2010)"}}&lt;/span&gt;) and are the first symptom in approximately 43%. Even without treatment, approximately 60% of patients will eventually regain visual accuity within a few months (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2524212", "name": "Wilhelm, H. et al  (2015)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). Most MS patients experience progressive muscle weakness in the extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance; these symptoms may be severe enough to prevent walking or standing. Severe fatigue is also common (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2522906", "name": "Tur, C. (2016)"}}&lt;/span&gt;), and may be complicated by other comorbidities such as depression (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2519226", "name": "Fiest, K.M. et al  (2016)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). Common sensory disturbances include paresthesia (a feeling of numbness or prickling), &lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siDiseaseBriefing", "linkID": "49", "name": "Pain"}}&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2522894", "name": "Iannitti, T. et al  (2014)"}}&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2522899", "name": "Heitmann, H. et al  (2015)"}}&lt;/span&gt;), and loss of sensation (pain, temperature, touch). Some patients complain of speech impediments, tremors, dizziness and hearing loss. Approximately 70% of all MS sufferers experience some degree of cognitive impairment, especially affecting domains of working memory, long-term memory and executive function, although overt dementia is uncommon (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2519216", "name": "Pflugshaupt, T. et al  (2016)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). Other common features and comorbidities of MS include migraine and other headaches (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2525491", "name": "Sahai-Srivastava, S. et al  (2016)"}}&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siDiseaseBriefing", "linkID": "22", "name": "Depression"}}&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2525482", "name": "Feinstein, A. et al  (2014)"}}&lt;/span&gt;), sleep disorders (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1375551", "name": "Bamer, A.M. et al  (2008)"}}&lt;/span&gt;; see &lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siDiseaseBriefing", "linkID": "94", "name": "Insomnia"}}&lt;/span&gt;), sexual dysfunction (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1375552", "name": "Tepavcevic, D.K. et al  (2008)"}}&lt;/span&gt;), spasticity, epileptic seizures (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1591728", "name": "Catenoix, H. et al  (2011)"}}&lt;/span&gt;), and bowel and/or bladder dysfunction (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2518943", "name": "Hart, F.M. et al  (2016)"}}&lt;/span&gt;).

&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Comorbidities such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and arthritis are also common, affecting approximately one-third of participants in one study, with a greater percentage of males and persons of low socioeconomic status reporting comorbid disorders (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1375546", "name": "Marrie, R. et al  (2008)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). An increased risk of ischemic stroke has been reported in some patients with multiple sclerosis (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1717307", "name": "D\'haeseleer, M. et al  (2011)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). The presence of comorbidities may account to some degree for the unpredictable nature of disease progression in MS (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1375546", "name": "Marrie, R. et al  (2008)"}}&lt;/span&gt;).

&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;According to the World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 study, multiple sclerosis was the cause of death of 18,900 (range 17,300 to 20,000) people worldwide in 2015, yielding an age-standardized death rate of 0.3 per 100,000 (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2551327", "name": "Wang, H.D. et al  (2016)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). In a meta-analysis of 12 published studies covering the period 1959-2012, the crude mortality rate for MS patients was shown to be 9.78 per 100,000 person-years, and did not change significantly over time. The pooled all-cause standardized mortality rate (SMR) in this meta-analysis was 2.80. Female patients were found to be at a great survival disadvantage as compared to male patients (SMR 3.06 vs. 2.56) (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2488756", "name": "Manouchehrinia, A. et al  (2016)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). A U.K. study found that the mortality rate for MS patients was 3.5-fold greater than in the general population, with respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease and cancer as the leading causes of death in this patient population (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1794364", "name": "Lalmohamed, A. et al  (2012)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). In a large study of French MS patients, overall excess mortality was only moderately higher than in the general population. MS mortality was strongly linked to disability and disease duration, with the most significant increase after 20 years of illness. Mortality rates were also significantly higher in male patients (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2519269", "name": "Leray, E. et al  (2015)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). Among commercially insured U.S. patients with multiple sclerosis enrolled in the OptumInsight Research database (1996 to 2009), the mortality rate was nearly twice as high as in non-MS controls (899 vs. 446 death per 100,000 person-years, respectively). The principle causes of death (other than MS itself) in the MS population were infections, cardiovascular disease, and pulmonary disease (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2525483", "name": "Goodin, D.S. et al  (2014)"}}&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2525484", "name": "Kaufman, D.W. et al  (2014)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). Figures from the U.S. Department of Defense administrative claims database indicate that all-cause mortality among MS patients was 2.9-fold higher than among non-MS controls. The leading causes of death of MS patients included infectious disease, diseases of the nervous system, respiratory and circulatory diseases, and suicide (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2525490", "name": "Capkun, G. et al  (2015)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). Among individuals included in the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) registry, factors linked to increased mortality included older age at diagnosis (registry enrollment), male sex, and greater degree of disability (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2519274", "name": "Cutter, G.R. et al  (2015)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). 

&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A mortality rate of 2.04 per 100,000 person-years (1990-2010) was reported in a Swedish study using the national health statistics database (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1984396", "name": "Boström, I. et al  (2012)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). According to country-specific data from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study, the age-standardized death rate in China was significantly lower: 0.01 per 100,000 population (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2414221", "name": "Zhou, M. et al  (2015)"}}&lt;/span&gt;). In Canada, which has one of the world's highest prevalence rates, the average annual MS mortality rate from 1975-2009 was 1.23 per 100,000 (1.45 in females and 0.99 in males). While mortality rates remained generally stable over the period, there was a change in age distribution, with patients dying at a later age (&lt;span class="dsJsonData"&gt;{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2519273", "name": "Warren, S.A. et al  (2016)"}}&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/paras&gt;</ns2:com.thomsonreuters.ls.service.contract.soap.diseasebriefings.v2.GetDiseaseBriefingSectionTextV2Response>
