<paras><para>Heart failure is a clinical syndrome, the diagnosis of which relies on the analysis of various signs and symptoms (medical history and physical examination), together with the relevant clinical tests, although no single test can establish the presence or absence of heart failure. The most frequent clinical findings in patients with heart failure are decreased exercise tolerance and dyspnea or fluid retention. In patients presenting with dyspnea with suspected heart failure, a chest radiograph and electrocardiogram should be obtained. If these tests are normal, heart failure is unlikely. If, however, abnormalities show on these two tests, patients should undergo echocardiography with Doppler flow studies. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) provides information about pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systolic and diastolic function, valvular disease, regional wall function abnormalities and other data (<span class="dsJsonData">{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1828305", "name": "Khan, U.A. et al  (2012)"}}</span>; <span class="dsJsonData">{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2851598", "name": "Hopper, I. et al  (2017)"}}</span>; <span class="dsJsonData">{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "2863509", "name": "Bloom, M.W. et al  (2017)"}}</span>).</para><para>Improvements in the robustness and speed of magnetic resonance imaging techniques have had a major impact on the management of heart disease. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a cost-effective technique that is considered the gold standard imaging tool for the management of patients with heart failure and chronic ischemic heart disease. CMR can be used to visualize cardiac perfusion, edema and necrosis. It can also be used to determine the underlying etiology, evaluate disease progression and monitor treatment response (<span class="dsJsonData">{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1407503", "name": "Karamitsos, T.D. et al  (2009)"}}</span>). Other imaging techniques that are being used increasingly in the diagnosis of heart failure include strain imaging technologies (e.g., speckle tracking imaging, velocity vector-based strain imaging), single-photon emission computed tomography and cardiac computed tomography (<span class="dsJsonData">{"ulink": {"linkType": "siReference", "linkID": "1828305", "name": "Khan, U.A. et al  (2012)"}}</span>). </para></paras>
