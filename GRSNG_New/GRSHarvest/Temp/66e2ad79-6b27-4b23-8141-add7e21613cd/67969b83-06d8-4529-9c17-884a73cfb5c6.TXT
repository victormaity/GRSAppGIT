<paras><para>For an overview of validated therapeutic targets for this indication, consult the targetscape below. The targetscape shows an overall cellular and molecular landscape or comprehensive network of connections among the current therapeutic targets for the treatment of the condition and their biological actions. An arrow indicates a positive effect; a dash indicates a negative effect. Gray or lighter symbols are protein targets that are not validated (i.e., not under active development [UAD]). Pink text boxes with red borders indicate validated gene targets. Yellow text boxes are gene targets not UAD. Purple and pink text boxes indicate extracellular and intracellular effects, respectively. Green text boxes indicate a related disease/condition/symptom. For in-depth information on a specific target or mechanism of action, see the corresponding section in this report.<span class="dsJsonData">{"ulink": {"linkType":"siImage", "linkID": "acutelymphocyticleukemia_targetscape.gif", "anchor": "3466", "title": "Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) Targetscape", "footer": ""}}</span><span class="dsJsonData">{"ulink": {"linkType":"siImage", "linkID": "cll_targetscape.gif", "anchor": "4447", "title": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Targetscape", "footer": ""}}</span><span class="dsJsonData">{"ulink": {"linkType":"siImage", "linkID": "acutemyeloidleukemia_targetscape.gif", "anchor": "3467", "title": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Targetscape", "footer": ""}}</span> <span class="dsJsonData">{"ulink": {"linkType":"siImage", "linkID": "cml_targetscape.gif", "anchor": "4493", "title": "Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Targetscape", "footer": ""}}</span></para></paras>
