A total of 67% patients in the safety analysis set completed the 21-day DLT observation study. Overall, two patients each discontinued the study due to drug treatment emergent adverse event (DTEAE) and withdrawal of consent. In the high dose (1.8 mg/kg) cohort, 8% had angioedema as DLT during the 21-day DLT observation period, in line with dose escalation rules; the 1.8 mg/kg dose group was subsequently expanded from three to six patients. During the study, all patients had &gt;/= 1 TEAE and &gt;/= DTEAE. MSB-0010445 related DTEAE was reported in 92%. Grade 3 (angioedema [a DLT], generalized pruritis, generalized rash) were three MSB-0010445-related DTEAEs and all were reported in same patient (1.8 mg/kg dose group) and all resolved. There was no grade 4/5 DTEAEs reported. Death was reported in two patients due to disease progression which was considered unrelated to the study.

Following single dose administration, serum MSB-0010445 was found to be dose proportional from 0.3 to 2.4 mg/kg dose. At the end of 1 h infusion Tmax was observed and t1/2 was found to be approximately 8 to 16 h. Following multiple doses, dose proportional increase in Cmax of serum MSB-0010445 was reported from 0.3 to 2.4 mg/kg. At the end of 1 h infusion Tmax was observed and t1/2 was found to be approximately 15 to 18 h. The best overall response reported was stable disease (SD) in five patients among 12 patients (four patients with disease control &gt;/= 4.3 months; 3 out of 5 patients with previous ipilimumab + anti-PD1 treatment) and progressive disease (PD) in 3 out of 12 patients, by irRECIST, and best overall response was unevaluable in 4 out of 12 patients. In two patients, best overall response was SD and progressive disease was observed in six patients, by RECIST. On day 32, increased numbers of CD8+ tumor infiltrating Tcells were observed in two patients (n = 1, 2.4 mg/kg group; n = 1, low dose group) relative to baseline and a decrease was reported for one patient (low dose group).

A total of  two subjects from 'group 3' would constitute 'group 3      pilot' and would start the study 7 days before the start of the remaining 'group 3' subjects. All study subjects in groups 2 and 3 would receive two vaccinations with the assigned      investigational medical product (IMP) at 0 and 1 month and one regular booster vaccination      with the standard HB vaccine HBVaxPro-10 microg 6 months after the first dose according to the      recommended vaccination schedule for HBVaxPro-10 microg.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The primary study parameter would be the number and intensity of      local and systemic adverse reactions (redness, swelling, impaired movement). The secondary      study parameter  would be the HBAI-20 vaccine immunogenicity as calculated by the median titer,      geometric mean titer, geometric mean titer increase, proportion of subjects with a virus      specific antibody titer measure by the COBAS system of  &gt;/= 10 mIU/ml, and seroconversion rate.      &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Study subjects would be vaccinated three times at 0, 1 and 6 months from the      beginning of the study and invited to the hospital for eight visits. The risks associated with      participation in this study would be considered to be low and comparable with standard vaccines.      Physical discomfort after vaccine administration can occur at the injection site (redness,      swelling, etc) and systemically (fever, fatigue, headache). Effects  would be expected to occur      for a short period of time (within the first 4 days after the first and second injection).      In addition subjects may experience adverse reactions to the cytokine component of the      adjuvant. Because of the very low dose of the cytokine component of the adjuvant, which would      be gradually released, the risks  would be expected to be low. The potential risks of venepuncture      for blood sampling would be mild pain and hematoma,  will be considered low.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The naive subjects participating in this study would benefit from participating by receiving      immunization against hepatitis B.

The      immunogenicity of the adjuvanted vaccine would be measured as the percentage of subjects that      attain seroprotection after the first vaccination at 1, 2, and 3, 5 months (HBsAg antibodies      &gt;/= 10 mIU/ml measure by the COBAS system). The secondary study parameter would be the safety of the      vaccination. The safety of the vaccination would be the number and severity of the local and      systemic adverse reactions.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group      relatedness:&lt;br/&gt;Study subjects would be vaccinated 3 times at 0, 1, and 2 months from the beginning of the      study and invited to the hospital or vaccination centre for 4 or 5 visits. The risks      associated with participation in this study would be considered to be low and comparable with      standard vaccines. Physical discomfort after vaccine administration can occur at the      injection site (redness, swelling, etc) and systemically (fever, fatigue, headache). Effects      would be expected to occur for a short period of time (within the first 4 days after the first and      second injection). In addition subjects may experience adverse reactions to the cytokine      component of the adjuvant. Because of the very low dose of the cytokine component of the      adjuvant, which would be gradually released, the risks are expected to be low.

NKTR-214 had a sustained exposure with a half-life of 20 h. NKTR-214 (0.006 mg/kg; n = 9) exposure increased proportionate to the dose and gradual increase in active cytokine species was observed with Cmax reaching 1 to 2 days, post dose. In patients receiving NKTR-214, on day 3, transient decrease in lymphocytes was observed which increased by day 9, consistent with observations after HD-IL-2, and transient increase in soluble IL-2 receptor-alpha shed from activated T-cells. By 14 days post-dose, pharmacodynamics effects returned to baseline and similar effects was observed across the dose levels.  All evaluated patients had proliferating CD4, CD8 and NK cells promoted by NKTR-214, which reproduced with repeat administration, and was observed across all the dose levels and schedules. In the tumor cells, NKTR-214 increased the proliferation of CD8+ T-cells, which had increased Ki67 expression. In all patients, increase in immune cell population was observed. The immune-cell elevations observed at week 3, outlasted measurable plasma exposures to NKTR-214. Tumor reduction between 6 to 30% was observed in three of six patients with RCC receiving NKTR-214 and who had progressed on prior TK inhibitors.

Out of 4 patients with Stage IV renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who were immuno-oncology (I-O) treatment naive who experienced stable disease (SD), confirmed partial responses (PRs) were observed in 3 patients with tumor shrinkage while on NKTR-214 monotherapy (range of 3 to 8 cycles) and then received sequential therapy with nivolumab. All three patients with confirmed PRs experienced rapid responses at first 8-week scan after initiating sequential therapy with nivolumab. The fourth patient experienced SD at first 8-week scan.  All four patients had progressed on one or more prior tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies and all were continuing on therapy with nivolumab. Two heavily pre-treated Stage IV patients were continued treatment with monotherapy NKTR-214.

After sequential therapy with nivolumab, partial response was achieved in three patients except one patient with stable disease who had achieved 30% tumor reduction after NKTR-214 treatment. Even in patients who had failed in multiple prior immunotherapeutic agents, NKTR-214 treatment caused an increase in immune cells in the blood and tumor microenvironment.

Four DLTs were observed, one grade 3 dyspnoea at 0.3 mg/kg and three grade 3 skin rash (one at 0.6 mg/kg and two at 0.9 mg/kg). The most commonly occurred adverse event was dose-dependent skin rash (48%) and generally improved rapidly with the use of topical steroids and antihistamine agents. At doses 0.225 mg/kg, fever (40degC) was observed in 40% of patients. Lymphopenia (44%),  dry skin (40%) and mild (grade 1) hypotension (31%) were the other frequently observed adverse events and were observed to be independent of dose. Grade 2 leukocytoclastic vasculitis (n = 1), grade 2 autoimmune thyroiditis (n = 1), dyspnea (n = 1), transaminase increase (n = 1), grade 3 skin rash (n = 7), exacerbation of psoriasis (n = 1) and grade 2 and 3 angioedema (n = 2) lead to discontinuation of treatment.  Study withdrawal was observed due to PD reported in three patients.

The maximum tolerated dose for the  &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="57922"&gt;EMD-521873&lt;/ulink&gt; was observed to be 0.6 mg/kg. The median number of cycles per patient was observed to be two and the majority of patients (n = 20) were observed to receive two treatment cycles. Treatment discontinuation was observed in 77.1% of patients due to progressive disease (PD), and in 22.9% of patients due to toxicity. Stable disease for &amp;gt; 6 weeks was observed in 25% of patients and no tumor responses were observed. Median survival time observed in &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="57922"&gt;EMD-521873&lt;/ulink&gt; and cyclophosphamide plus &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="57922"&gt;EMD-521873&lt;/ulink&gt; arm were 9.6 and 7.0 months, respectively. Antibodies were observed in 69% of patients with peaks occurring on day 8 of cycle 1. Antibodies did not appear to be neutralizing as they influenced neither the PK nor the biological activity of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="57922"&gt;EMD-521873&lt;/ulink&gt;.
