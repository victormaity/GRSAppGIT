NY-ESO-1 Plasmid DNA (pPJV7611) cancer vaccine would be administered by PMED at a pressure of 500 psi using the XR-1 Powderject delivery device. The 4 microg dosage of NY-ESO-1 would be administered as four 1 microg PMEDs in close proximity. Similarly, the 8 microg dosage would be administered as eight 1 microg PMEDs. The third cohort of patients would receive the 8 microgdosage as a cluster dosage of four doses (day 1, 3, 5, 8) as two 1 microg PMEDs per day. Blood samples would be obtained at baseline, 2 weeks after each vaccination, prior to the second and third vaccination, and 4 weeks after the third vaccination for the assessment of clinical hematology, biochemistry measurements and immunology responses. Patients would be evaluated for toxicity throughout the study. DTH testing would be performed with NY-ESO-1 protein in all patients, with NY-ESO-1b peptide in HLA-A2+ patients and with NY-ESO-1 DP4 peptide in HLA-DP4+ patients at baseline and at the 2-week visit following the first and third vaccinations. NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 specific antibodies would be assessed in all patients by ELISA using recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein.

The study will be presented to eligible patients by the patient's surgeon at the time when an appointment will be made for cystoscopy for suspicion of bladder cancer (BC) or to confirm BC diagnosis. The study consists of two groups. Group 1: participants will receive one capsule (10 mg Prostaphane) taken bid (two capsules, 20 mg Prostaphane total). Group 2: participants will receive one capsule (placebo) taken two times per day (2 capsules total).
