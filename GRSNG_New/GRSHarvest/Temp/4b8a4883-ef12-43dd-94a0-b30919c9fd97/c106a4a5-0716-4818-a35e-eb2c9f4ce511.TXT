Part B: Response Extension Phase: all patients would undergo blinded crossover loading doses to allow all patients to receive BIVV-009 while maintaining part A blinding.</Field><Field name="trialRegimens" type="string"></Field><Field name="trialOutcomes" type="string"></Field><Field name="trialAdverseEvents" type="string"></Field><Field name="trialCriteriaInclusion" type="string">Adult male and female patients &gt;/= 18 years of age at Screening Body weight of&gt;/= 39 kg at screening Confirmed diagnosis of primary cold agglutinin disease (CAD) based on the following criteria: Chronic hemolysis Polyspecific direct antiglobulin test (DAT) positive Monospecific DAT strongly positive for C3d Cold agglutinin titer&gt;/= 64 at 4 degC Immunoglobulin G (IgG) DAT&amp;lt;/= 1+ No overt malignant disease Hemoglobin level&amp;lt;/= 10.0 g/dl Bilirubin level above the normal reference range, including patients with Gilbert's Syndrome Ferritin levels within the normal reference ranges unless outside normal range and deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator (or designee) Presence of one or more of the following CAgD-related signs or symptoms within 3 months of Screening: Symptomatic anemia defined as: Fatigue Weakness Shortness of breath Palpitations, fast heart beat Light headedness and/or Chest pain Acrocyanosis Raynaud's syndrome Hemoglobinuria Disabling circulatory symptoms, and/or Major adverse vascular event (including thrombosis) Bone marrow biopsy within 6 months of Screening with no overt evidence of lymphoproliferative disease or other hematological malignancy.
