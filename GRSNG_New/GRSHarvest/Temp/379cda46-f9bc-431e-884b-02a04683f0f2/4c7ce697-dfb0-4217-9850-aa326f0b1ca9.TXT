The researchers demonstrated that the human immune system can mount a response against mutant proteins expressed by cancers that arise in epithelial cells which can line the internal and external surfaces of the body. Research led by Rosenberg and his colleagues had shown that human melanoma tumors often contain mutation-reactive immune cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The presence of these cells may help to explain the effectiveness of adoptive cell therapy (ACT) and other forms of immunotherapy in the treatment of melanoma. In ACT, a patient’s own TILs are collected, and those with the best antitumor activity are grown in the laboratory to produce large populations that are infused into the patient. The results provide evidence that a T-cell response against a mutant protein can be harnessed to mediate regression of a metastatic epithelial cell cancer.</Abstract><Region>USA</Region><Languages><language>English</language></Languages><Number>185741</Number><DocCategories><DocCategory>Reference Document</DocCategory></DocCategories><ProdCategories><ProdCategory>Drugs and Biologics</ProdCategory></ProdCategories><DocTypes><DocType>Press Release</DocType></DocTypes><Source>http://www.nih.gov&lt;br/&gt;08-MAY-2014</Source><DateDisplay>8-May-2014</DateDisplay><DocForm>0</DocForm><AddedDate>09-May-2014</AddedDate><LastUpdatedDate>14-May-2014 07:44:31</LastUpdatedDate><Topics/><MedicalDeviceSpecialties/></getRegulatorySnapshotOutput>
