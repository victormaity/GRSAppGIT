Across groups, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were similar. For ciprofloxacin DPI 14 days on/off, 28 days on/off, and pooled placebo, TEAE rates were 82.4,  78 and 83.2%, respectively; and TE-serious AE rates were 16.9, 19.9 and 23.4%, respectively. Low and similar occurrence of TE bronchospasm was observed (5.1, 5 and 7.3% patients treated with ciprofloxacin DPI 14 days on/off, 28 days on/off, and placebo respectively) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1893096"&gt;1893096&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Results were published in January 2018.

A significant decrease of 39% in exacerbation rate was observed in the 14-day treatment arm, with mean number of exacerbation of 0.6 and 1 for the ciprofloxacin and placebo (incidence rate ratio 0.61; p = 0.0061) groups, respectively. However, no significant difference between treatment groups was reported in the 28-day arm, with mean number of exacerbations of 0.8 for both treatment groups. The 14-day arm also reported a significant delay in time to first exacerbation; the median time to first exacerbation was &amp;gt; 336 days on both ciprofloxacin arms versus 186 days for the pooled placebo group, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.53 (p = 0.0005) and 0.73 in the 14- and 28-day arms, respectively [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1793365"&gt;1793365&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1793367"&gt;1793367&lt;/ulink&gt;].

Similar results were presented in May 2017 [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1929552"&gt;1929552&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Similar results were published in January 2018  [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="2029839"&gt;2029839&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2016, further results were presented. Primary endpoints (time to first exacerbation and frequency of exacerbation) were met in the 14 days on/off arm. In the 28 days on/off regimen, a non-significant trend in favor of ciprofloxacin DPI was observed for both primary endpoints (time to first exacerbation [p = 0.065] and frequency of exacerbation [p = 0.89]) [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1893096"&gt;1893096&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2017, further results were  presented.  In ciprofloxacin 14 days on/off, placebo 14 days on/off, ciprofloxacin 28 days on/off and placebo 28 days on/off groups, mean change from baseline to end-of-treatment in St George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) symptoms score was -7.20, 2.78, -8.17 and -4.23, respectively; in quality of life questionnaire-bronchiectasis v3.1 (QOL-B) respiratory symptom score was 6.72, 4.45, 7.7 and 8.22, respectively. At end-of-treatment (EOT), significant greater improvements were observed in SGRQ symptoms score for ciprofloxacin DPI 14-days on/off versus pooled placebo (difference in mean change, ?7.59 points, p = 0.009); these data was supported by the mixed model of repeated measurements (MMRM) sensitivity analysis (difference in mean change, ?7.09 points, p = 0.001). A trend towards symptom improvement was observed at the end of the ‘on' cycles for ciprofloxacin DPI 14-days on/off versus matching placebo irrespictive of no significant difference in overall changes in the QOL-B Respiratory symptoms scores (ciprofloxacin 14-days on/off versus pooled placebo p &amp;gt; 0.025). Only in MMRM sensitivity analysis, statistical significant improvements were observed in SGRQ symptoms scores in ciprofloxacin 28-days on/off versus pooled placebo were observed (p = 0.004). No statistical significant changes were observed in QOL-B scores for the 28-day arms [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1929552"&gt;1929552&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Further  were published in January 2018. Both ciprofloxacin DPI  and placebo groups in 28-day on/off regimen showed no statistically significant differences in outcomes     [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="2029839"&gt;2029839&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2018, pooled results of RESPIRE-1 and &lt;ulink linkType="Protocol" linkID="181044"&gt;RESPIRE-2&lt;/ulink&gt; were presented. Of patients who reported at least two exacerbations in the previous 12 months as per entry criteria, 45, 36 and 32% of patients in the ciprofloxacin DPI 14-days and 28-days, and pooled placebo groups, respectively did not record any exacerbation during the 48-week study period. In both RESPIRE 1 and 2, more exacerbations were recorded using the less stringent definition in comparison to stringent definition (36 to 45 and 24 to 26 more exacerbations, respectively). In RESPIRE 1, 50 to 66 more exacerbations were noted using the all investigator-reported definition compared with the stringent definition. In ciprofloxacin DPI 14-days and 28-days, and pooled placebo groups in RESPIRE 1, the number of exacerbations (as observed) over 48 weeks with stringent definition was 86, 116 and 126, respectively; less stringent definition was 122, 161 and 168, respectively; with all investigator reported definition was 136, 182 and 176, respectively; with stringent definition + hospitalization was 10, 20 and 15, respectively; and with stringent definition + Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogen was  25, 41 and 36, respectively. Evaluations of incidence rate ratios and hazard ratios of primary endpoint (time to first exacerbation and frequency of exacerbation) with less stringent exacerbation definitions compared to stringent definition showed a small decrease in effect size.

this study was to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="77251"&gt;LJM-716&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="65353"&gt;BYL-719&lt;/ulink&gt; against currently      available treatments of physician's choice of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3803"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/ulink&gt; or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2953"&gt;docetaxel&lt;/ulink&gt; or &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2871"&gt;irinotecan&lt;/ulink&gt; in previously treated esophageal squamous cell      carcinoma patients. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The secondary objectives of the trial were to determine the tolerability, progression-free survival and overall survival.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The study design included a Phase Ib dose-escalation portion to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination of LJM-716 and alpelisib, followed by an open-label, randomized Phase II part to compare anti-tumor activity of LJM-716-alpelisib combination versus physician's choice of second-line therapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel, irinotecan). However, the phase II part was not conducted as the study was terminated early due to limited anti-tumor activity with LJM-716-alpelisib combination observed in phase Ib.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/AimAndScope&gt;</AimsAndScope><ProtocolDescription>&lt;ProtocolDescription&gt;&lt;para&gt;Patients previously treated for  esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)  will   be randomized into one of the two groups as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Group 1(n = 42): patients would  receive LJM-716 (10 to 40 mg/kg) as a qw infusion and BYL-719 (200 to 400 mg, po, qd) beginning on cycle 1 day 1. The doses of  LJM-716 and BYL-719 would be increased as dose escalation proceeds until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is established.&lt;br/&gt;Group 2 (n = 42):  patients would receive paclitaxel or docetaxel or irinotecan. Approximately 42 previously treated esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients would be enrolled to the Paclitaxel, Docetaxel or Irinotecan arm (physician's choice arm) to evaluate the anti-tumor activity and further assess the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of the LJM-716-BYL-719 combination versus current therapies (physician's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel or irinotecan).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/ProtocolDescription&gt;</ProtocolDescription></ProtocolAndOutcomes><AdverseEventsByInterventions></AdverseEventsByInterventions><DoseRouteByInterventions></DoseRouteByInterventions><SitesByCountries><SitesByCountry country="Belgium"><Sites><Site><RecruitmentStatus id="4">Completed</RecruitmentStatus><Contacts><Contact type="Facility contact"><Name>Clinical Trial Information Desk</Name></Contact></Contacts></Site><Site><Name>Novartis Investigative Site</Name><Address1>Bruxelles</Address1><Address3>1200</Address3><Contacts></Contacts></Site></Sites></SitesByCountry><SitesByCountry country="Canada"><Sites><Site><Name>Novartis Investigative Site</Name><Address1>Toronto</Address1><Address2>Ontario</Address2><Address3>M5G 2M9</Address3><CountrySubDivision>Ontario</CountrySubDivision><Contacts></Contacts></Site></Sites></SitesByCountry><SitesByCountry country="Spain"><Sites><Site><RecruitmentStatus id="4">Completed</RecruitmentStatus><Contacts><Contact type="Facility contact"><Name>Departamento Médico Oncología (GMO)</Name></Contact></Contacts></Site><Site><Name>Novartis Investigative Site</Name><Address1>Barcelona</Address1><Address2>Catalunya</Address2><Address3>08035</Address3><CountrySubDivision>Catalunya</CountrySubDivision><Contacts></Contacts></Site></Sites></SitesByCountry><SitesByCountry country="France"><Sites><Site><RecruitmentStatus id="6">Terminated</RecruitmentStatus><Contacts><Contact type="Facility contact"><Name>Information&amp;communication médicales</Name></Contact></Contacts></Site></Sites></SitesByCountry><SitesByCountry country="UK"><Sites><Site><RecruitmentStatus id="3">No longer recruiting</RecruitmentStatus><Contacts><Contact type="Facility contact"><Name>Medical Collaboration Centre</Name></Contact></Contacts></Site><Site><Name>Novartis Investigative Site</Name><Address1>Manchester</Address1><Address3>M20 2BX</Address3><Contacts></Contacts></Site></Sites></SitesByCountry><SitesByCountry country="Hong Kong"><Sites><Site><Name>Novartis Investigative Site</Name><Address1>Hong Kong</Address1><Contacts></Contacts></Site></Sites></SitesByCountry><SitesByCountry country="Japan"><Sites><Site><Contacts></Contacts></Site></Sites></SitesByCountry><SitesByCountry country="South Korea"><Sites><Site><Name>Novartis Investigative Site</Name><Address1>Seoul</Address1><Address2>Korea</Address2><Address3>03080</Address3><CountrySubDivision>Korea</CountrySubDivision><Contacts></Contacts></Site><Site><Name>Novartis Investigative Site</Name><Address1>Seoul</Address1><Address2>Korea</Address2><Address3>05505</Address3><CountrySubDivision>Korea</CountrySubDivision><Contacts></Contacts></Site></Sites></SitesByCountry><SitesByCountry country="Singapore"><Sites><Site><Name>Novartis Investigative Site</Name><Address1>Singapore</Address1><Address3>169610</Address3><Contacts></Contacts></Site></Sites></SitesByCountry><SitesByCountry country="Taiwan"><Sites><Site><Name>Novartis Investigative Site</Name><Address1>Tainan</Address1><Address2>Taiwan ROC</Address2><Address3>70421</Address3><CountrySubDivision>Taiwan ROC</CountrySubDivision><Contacts></Contacts></Site><Site><Name>Novartis Investigative Site</Name><Address1>Taipei</Address1><Address3>10048</Address3><Contacts></Contacts></Site></Sites></SitesByCountry><SitesByCountry country="US"><Sites><Site><Name>Karmanos Cancer Institute Dept of Onc</Name><Address1>Detroit</Address1><Address2>Michigan</Address2><Address3>48201</Address3><CountrySubDivision code="MI">Michigan</CountrySubDivision><Contacts></Contacts></Site><Site><Name>University of Chicago Medical Center Dept of Onc</Name><Address1>Chicago</Address1><Address2>Illinois</Address2><Address3>60637</Address3><CountrySubDivision code="IL">Illinois</CountrySubDivision><Contacts></Contacts></Site><Site><Name>University of Texas/MD Anderson Cancer Center Gastrointestinal Med.

From the association between concentration and safety, adverse events (AE) with significant association (p &amp;lt; 0.05) were grade 1+ diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, rash and stomatitis. No significant associations between grade 3+ AEs and pharmacokinetics were observed. Fixed dosing tend to increase AE rates in patients with lower weight and reduced AE rates in patients with higher weight, when compared to weight-based dosing. In most of the instance, the predicted AE rates in lower weight patients (&amp;lt;/=70 kg) treated with fixed dosing were still lower when compared with the predicted AE rates in higher-weight patients (&gt;70 kg) treated with weight-based dosing [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="2039654"&gt;2039654&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/AdverseEvents&gt;</AdverseEvents><AimsAndScope>&lt;AimAndScope&gt;&lt;para&gt;This study was a phase I, pharmacological, open-labeled, dose-escalation trial using a '3 + 3'

The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of MM-121 an anti-ErbB3 human mAb in adult patients (n = 499) with solid tumors. Pharmacokinetic analysis had demonstrated a few statistically significant covariates including weight, sex, race and albumin levels. Similar variability was observed in fixed and weight based doses. When compared to 20 mg/kg, steady state Cavg were higher with 3 g and the values were comparable to Cmax with 40 mg/kg. When compared to weight based dose, steady state Cavg were equal or higher for fixed dose. Higher minimum concentrations (Cmin) were observed in all doses, when compared to the nonclinical target concentration of 100 mg/l. With higher weight, weight base dose showed higher C (average) and Cmax, and fixed dose led to lower exposure. The recommended fixed dose of MM-121 was 3 g (q3w)+ &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="2953"&gt;docetaxel&lt;/ulink&gt; in NSCLC and MM-121 was 3 g (q2w) + &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3313"&gt;fulvestrant&lt;/ulink&gt; in metastatic breast cancer patients. Geometric mean of initial clearance (L/week), volume (l), initial half life (weeks) and terminal half life (weeks) were 2.90, 3.18, 0.27 and 1.62, respectively. Geometric mean of average concentration (Cavg; mg/l), in 40 + 20 mg/kg qw, 3000 mg q2w, 20 mg/kg q2w, and 3000 mg q3w dose regimens were 907.2, 376.4, 173.0, and 279.7, respectively; and GL5 mean ratio with 40 + 20 mg/kg qw as reference was 0.42, 0.19, and 0.31, in 3000 mg q2w, 20 mg/kg q2w, and 3000 mg q3w dose regimens, respectively, in cycle 1.

Improved neurological symptoms/signs were seen in   0% (0/6) placebo and 100% (11/11) of evaluable &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8047"&gt;bevacizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;-treated patients. &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8047"&gt;Bevacizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; reduced all T2 FLAIR volumes 23 to 96%; &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8047"&gt;bevacizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; reduced all Gd-contrast T1 volumes 32 to 84%; Chi squared test p = 0.002; DCE (dynamic contrast enhancement)-MRI (Ktrans, ve, vp) did not appear to be as sensitive as T2 FLAIR and Gd-contrast volume [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1555675"&gt;1555675&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Outcomes&gt;</Outcomes><ProtocolDescription>&lt;ProtocolDescription&gt;&lt;para&gt;The primary
 objective of this study would be to determine to what extent &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8047"&gt;bevacizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; can reduce active radiation toxicity to the CNS in patients with primary brain neoplasm, meningioma or head and neck cancer.
&lt;br/&gt;The secondary
objective of this study were as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Determine to what extent this drug can reduce dexamethasone dependence in these patients.
&lt;br/&gt;Determine to what extent this drug can improve neurological function in these patients.
&lt;br/&gt;Determine to what extent this drug can improve quality of life of these patients.
&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In this  randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, double-blind study. Patients would be randomized to one of two treatment arms.
&lt;br/&gt;Arm I: patients would receive &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8047"&gt;bevacizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; iv over 30 to 90 min on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to two courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
&lt;br/&gt;Arm II: patients would receive placebo iv over 30 to 90 min on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to two courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Patients in arm II who  failed to respond to treatment at 6 or 12 weeks may crossover to arm I and would receive two courses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8047"&gt;bevacizumab&lt;/ulink&gt; as in arm I. Patients in arm I (including crossover patients) who have responded to treatment would receive two additional courses of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8047"&gt;bevacizumab&lt;/ulink&gt;. Patients undergo MRI after courses two and  four. Quality of life and neurological function are assessed at baseline and periodically during study therapy, and at 12 and 24 weeks after completion of study treatment.
After completion of study treatment, patients were followed at 12 and 24 weeks.

&lt;br/&gt;Run-in phase: to determine a dose regimen of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="63199"&gt;EP-100&lt;/ulink&gt; at which the initial benefit/risk of
           &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="63199"&gt;EP-100&lt;/ulink&gt; combined with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3803"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/ulink&gt; could  be studied.&lt;br/&gt;Randomized phase: to compare the anti-tumor effects of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="63199"&gt;EP-100&lt;/ulink&gt; combined with weekly

           &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3803"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/ulink&gt; alone compared to the doublet combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3803"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/ulink&gt; with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="63199"&gt;EP-100&lt;/ulink&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;To determine an initial benefit/risk profile for this new drug combination [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1665104"&gt;1665104&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By August 2012, enrollment in the trial had been completed [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1318368"&gt;1318368&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/AimAndScope&gt;</AimsAndScope><Outcomes>&lt;Outcomes&gt;&lt;para&gt;In May 2015, results were presented. Target lesions were observed in three out six patients in the run-in period and clinical benefit and objective responses were observed in 83 and 33% of patients treated, respectively. In patients treated with EP-100 + paclitaxel, target liver responses were greater (complete and partial responses, n = 2, 1 and 7, 0, respectively) compared with paclitaxel alone-treated patients. In paclitaxel alone-treated younger patients, progression free survival (3.9 versus 2.3 months, respectively) was longer compared with patients treated with EP-100 + paclitaxel. In 5 out of 10 and 4 out of 7 heavily treated patients after progression on paclitaxel alone, addition of EP-100 led to 3 fold extension of time to progression and reduced target lesions, respectively. After paclitaxel failure, addition of EP-100 to paclitaxel led to decrease in target liver lesion in one patient. One patient with stable disease discontinued due to infusion reaction. Target lesion progression was reversed upon addition of EP-100 to paclitaxel  [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1664584"&gt;1664584&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In June 2015, results were presented. EP-100 appeared to sensitize paclitaxel-resistant ovarian tumors, leading to further tumor shrinkage and prolonged treatment response [&lt;ulink linkType="Reference" linkID="1665104"&gt;1665104&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In April 2018, results were presented.

      screening period, a 6 to 7 months treatment period, and a 30-day follow-up. All patients with stable disease or who have achieved partial or complete response and for whom dosing has been safe and reasonably well-tolerated may continue additional treatment cycles on the same regimen. Any patient whose imaging assessment shows disease progression after receiving at least two cycles of single agent weekly &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3803"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/ulink&gt; on arm  A may then be offered treatment with the combination of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="63199"&gt;EP-100&lt;/ulink&gt; plus &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3803"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/ulink&gt; in the same dose regimen as arm B.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;To confirm the maximum safe dose of &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="63199"&gt;EP-100&lt;/ulink&gt; when combined with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="3803"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/ulink&gt;, five to eight patients would be enrolled, in a run-in phase of the study.
