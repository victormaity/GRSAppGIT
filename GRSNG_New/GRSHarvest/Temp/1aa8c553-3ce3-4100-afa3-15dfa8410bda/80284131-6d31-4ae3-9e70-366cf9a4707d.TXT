The trial was conducted under an SPA agreement with the FDA and was to be conducted in eight countries, including the US. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the total hours of awake time per day spent in the off state. At that time, the trial was expected to complete in February 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1501698" linkType="Reference"&gt;1501698&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1501739" linkType="Reference"&gt;1501739&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In July 2016, the trial was ongoing and expected to complete in November 2016 [&lt;ulink linkID="1501739" linkType="Reference"&gt;1501739&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In December 2016, topline data were reported, which demonstrated that the study did not met its primary endpoint. At week 12, the change from baseline in daily off-time was not statistically significant different in the  20 and 40 mg istradefylline groups compared with placebo. At that time, the company would review the data, assess the secondary outcome measures and work with the FDA to discuss a regulatory filing [&lt;ulink linkID="1885013" linkType="Reference"&gt;1885013&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In September 2017, further data were presented at the XXIII World Congress of Neurology in Kyoto, Japan. For the placebo, istradefylline 20 and 40 mg/day groups, the least squares mean changes from baseline to week-12 in total OFF time/day were -0.88, -1.20, and -1.15 h, respectively.

For istradefylline at 20 mg, 40 mg and placebo, the changes in the daily off-time were -1.15, -1.28 and -0.44 h, respectively, and changes in daily on-time without troublesome dyskinesia were 1.16, 1.18 and 0.45 h, respectively. The percentage of subjects in the much improved plus very much improved were 12.5, 20.9 and 26% in the placebo, istradefylline at 20 mg/day and 40 mg/day groups, respectively.

Patients would receive 20 or 40 mg  istradefylline po qd for 12 weeks as an adjunct to levodopa. The primary outcome was to measure the reduction in time spent in the 'off' state. The trial was expected to be completed in May 2011 [&lt;ulink linkID="1034345" linkType="Reference"&gt;1034345&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In June 2012, data were presented at the International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders  in Dublin, Ireland. Both doses of istradefylline significantly reduced the average daily 'off time' compared with placebo; 40 mg istradefylline also significantly improved  the secondary endpoint of  Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) III (motor examination). Dyskinesia was more frequently observed in istradefylline-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients [&lt;ulink linkID="1302397" linkType="Reference"&gt;1302397&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="1302226" linkType="Reference"&gt;1302226&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2006, results were released from two North American phase III trials and a European phase III trial. The primary endpoint of the studies was to  reduce the 'wearing-off' seen with L-DOPA treatment. In one of the North American trials, the drug  cut the daily duration of PD symptoms, but in a second North American trial and a European study, the drug was not significantly more effective than placebo. These two trials, however, showed a trend towards improving motor function [&lt;ulink linkID="654406" linkType="Reference"&gt;654406&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2005, a long-term, open-label, uncontrolled phase III safety extension trial (&lt;ulink linkID="6291" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00199381&lt;/ulink&gt;, 6002-US-025) of istradefylline (20 or 40 mg), in 700 PD patients who had recently completed one year of istradefylline treatment, began in the US [&lt;ulink linkID="681258" linkType="Reference"&gt;681258&lt;/ulink&gt;].  &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In July 2004, a phase III PD trial began in the US  [&lt;ulink linkID="580136" linkType="Reference"&gt;580136&lt;/ulink&gt;], and by November 2004, the same trial had been initiated  in  Canada [&lt;ulink linkID="571699" linkType="Reference"&gt;571699&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II&lt;/subtitle&gt;In October 2016, a phase II study (&lt;ulink linkID="277374" linkType="Protocol"&gt;UMIN000024536&lt;/ulink&gt;) was to begin in Japan to assess the effect of istradefylline on onset of dyskinesia in patients (expected n = 280) with Parkinson's disease [&lt;ulink linkID="1868881" linkType="Reference"&gt;1868881&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By February 2008, a phase IIb trial was underway in Japan. By January 2009, results from the trial of istradefylline as an adjunct therapy to levodopa showed that  istradefylline demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo. The results warranted further development of the drug in Japan  [&lt;ulink linkID="976638" linkType="Reference"&gt;976638&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Patients were randomized to receive 20 or 40 mg of istradefylline or placebo for 12 weeks. Results showed both doses significantly reduced the duration of the 'off' period per day compared with placebo. No adverse events were reported except dyskinesia [&lt;ulink linkID="1039991" linkType="Reference"&gt;1039991&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2005, It was reported that a US clinical trial of the drug as a monotherapy  had begun in May 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="636577" linkType="Reference"&gt;636577&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At that time, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled phase IIa trial (NCT-00250393, 6002-0407), of istradefylline (40 mg/d), in 64 patients with PD was registered with the US National Institute of  Health. The primary outcome of the study would be the efficacy of istradefylline, as measured by the change in UPDRS and the Clinical Global Impression- Severity of illness scale (CGI-S). Study completion was expected in October, 2006 [&lt;ulink linkID="680975" linkType="Reference"&gt;680975&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in July 2007, it was reported that due to investment and cost issues, Kyowa had put the monotherapy trial on hold [&lt;ulink linkID="820393" linkType="Reference"&gt;820393&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In August 2003, data were published from a clinical trial which found that istradefylline reduced the time that advanced PD patients experienced tremors, slowness and stiffness by 1.7 h per day. Istradefylline did not worsen the severity of dyskinesias and was generally well tolerated by participants. In the 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 83 patients with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias on levodopa were randomized to three groups. All participants continued their levodopa treatment. One group additionally received placebo, another up to 20 mg per day of istradefylline, and the last up to 40 mg per day of istradefylline. Participants noted their status during half-hour intervals three times a week, recording whether they were asleep, off (medication benefit having worn off), on (medication providing benefit) without dyskinesia or on with dyskinesia [&lt;ulink linkID="500965" linkType="reference"&gt;500965&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="500946" linkType="reference"&gt;500946&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By February 2003, istradefylline was in phase IIb trials in Canada and the US, and in phase I trials in Japan for PD [&lt;ulink linkID="479010" linkType="reference"&gt;479010&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="451592" linkType="reference"&gt;451592&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, the US trials were reported to be suspended in October 2003, following FDA consultation, due to reports of mineral deposition in the brain during studies in rats.

In the 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial (presumed to be phase II &lt;ulink linkID="6997" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT00456586&lt;/ulink&gt;), istradefylline (40 mg/day) was given to patients with advanced PD. Istradefylline resulted in a modest, dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity and a reversal of motor disability. The drug caused no dyskinesias after 21 days and had a synergistic effect with L-DOPA [&lt;ulink linkID="657473" linkType="Reference"&gt;657473&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By 1999, istradefylline was undergoing phase II trials in Europe, including the UK, for PD [&lt;ulink linkID="271929" linkType="reference"&gt;271929&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="321641" linkType="reference"&gt;321641&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="343257" linkType="reference"&gt;343257&lt;/ulink&gt;].

In February 2002, Kyowa Hakko reported that it had successfully completed US phase IIa trials for PD and that at this time it was preparing to begin pivotal phase IIb and phase III trials in the US and elsewhere [&lt;ulink linkID="450690" linkType="reference"&gt;450690&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Phase IIb trials in PD were underway in the US by May 2002 [&lt;ulink linkID="451592" linkType="reference"&gt;451592&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;In March 2016, clinical data from a single-center, open-label, one-sequence, two-period, crossover (&lt;ulink linkID="199548" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02174250&lt;/ulink&gt;) study evaluating effect of rifampin on pharmacokinetics of istradefylline in 20 healthy subjects were presented at the 117th ASCPT Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA. Subjects received single oral dose of istradefylline tablet (40 mg) on day 1 of period-1 and on day 8 of period-2;  rifampin capsules (600 mg, po) was given daily for 20 days in period-2; all doses of istradefylline and rifampin were taken with 240 ml of water in the morning. A statistically significant decrease in the exposure of istradefylline was observed when co-administrated with rifampin. Rifampin effect on  two metabolites of istradefylline was inconsistent and variable. During either period, only single occurrences of individual treatment-emergent adverse events were reported with the exception of chromaturia due to rifampin [&lt;ulink linkID="1743354" linkType="Reference"&gt;1743354&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In March 2016, clinical data from a two-center, open-label, parallel group, single-dose study (&lt;ulink linkID="212419" linkType="Protocol"&gt;NCT02256033&lt;/ulink&gt;) in 10 healthy subjects and 10 subjects with mild hepatic impairment were presented at the 117th ASCPT Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA. Subjects received a single po dose of istradefylline (40 mg after an overnight fast). The plasma concentrations of istradefylline were similar in subjects with hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function. The pharmacokinetic exposure of istradefylline was minimally affected by mild hepatic impairment.  No dose adjustment was required in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 60 and 0% of subjects with mild HI and normal hepatic function, respectively [&lt;ulink linkID="1743352" linkType="Reference"&gt;1743352&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By 1997, the compound had shown good tolerability in phase I trials in healthy volunteers [&lt;ulink linkID="1160637" linkType="Reference"&gt;1160637&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Restless legs syndrome&lt;/subtitle&gt;In November 2005, it was reported that phase IIa trials in RLS began in the US in July 2005 [&lt;ulink linkID="636589" linkType="Reference"&gt;636589&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="657131" linkType="Reference"&gt;657131&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, in July 2007, it was reported that due to a lack of significant efficacy, the RLS trials were discontinued in January 2007 [&lt;ulink linkID="820393" linkType="Reference"&gt;820393&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkID="863027" linkType="Reference"&gt;863027&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Depression&lt;/subtitle&gt;By July 2001, istradefylline was in phase II trials in the US for depression [&lt;ulink linkID="422561" linkType="reference"&gt;422561&lt;/ulink&gt;]; these were ongoing in September 2001 [&lt;ulink linkID="422561" linkType="reference"&gt;422561&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, the company listed depression as a suspended indication in February 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="479010" linkType="reference"&gt;479010&lt;/ulink&gt;], and as a discontinued indication in June 2003 [&lt;ulink linkID="502347" linkType="Reference"&gt;502347&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;By July 2000, good results had been obtained with the drug in a preclinical depression model; at this time, Kyowa Hakko was hoping that the drug would become a new class of antidepressant [&lt;ulink linkID="376107" linkType="reference"&gt;376107&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/Premarketing&gt;</value></Premarketing><Preclinical><displayLabel>Preclinical</displayLabel><value>&lt;Preclinical&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2008, data were presented at the 38th SFN conference in Washington, DC, showing that istradefylline significantly shortened the amount of OFF time in lesioned rats treated long-term with L-DOPA [&lt;ulink linkID="954430" linkType="Reference"&gt;954430&lt;/ulink&gt;]. At the same meeting, data were presented which showed that istradefylline ameliorated cognitive impairments induced by lesions in the medial prefrontal cortex in rats [&lt;ulink linkID="955097" linkType="Reference"&gt;955097&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In November 2007, preclinical data were presented at the 37th SFN Meeting in San Diego, CA. C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with vehicle or istradefylline (10 microg/brain icv) followed by a single injection of MPTP (40 mg/kg ip). Blockade of adenosine A2a receptors by istradefylline significantly attenuated MPTP-induced activation of microglial and astrocyte cells, suggesting that istradefylline can protect against MPTP neurotoxicity [&lt;ulink linkID="850752" linkType="Reference"&gt;850752&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The potential of istradefylline in Huntington disease (HD) was investigated in R6/2 HD transgenic mouse model.

Contralateral rotations following L-Dopa treatment  were recorded by an automated rotometry system. Turning response for control mice increased gradually over the first week, reaching a maximum which was maintained for the following 2 weeks (approximately 600 contralateral turns/h). Treated mice dose-dependently reduced this figure 3-fold (0.03 mg/kg) and 5-fold (0.3 mg/kg)  supporting the possibility that A2A antagonists could be useful early adjunctive therapies to reduce the risk of dyskinesia development associated with  dopaminergic treatments [&lt;ulink linkID="633224" linkType="Reference"&gt;633224&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In October 2004, preclinical data on istradefylline were presented at the 34th SFN meeting in San Diego, CA.

PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symptoms of muscle rigidity, tremor and paucity of movement. It has been established for some time that the primary deficit in PD is a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra which project to the striatum, and indeed a substantial proportion (80 to 85%) of striatal dopamine is lost before symptoms are observed [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="402651"&gt;402651&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Adenosine receptors represent a subclass (P1) of the group of purine nucleotide and nucleoside G protein-coupled receptors known as purinoceptors the main pharmacologically distinct adenosine receptor subtypes are known as A1, A2A, A2B and A3. High levels of expression of A2A receptors are found in the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercule and striatum, where they are co-localized with the dopamine D2 receptor on striatopallidal output neurons [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="402666"&gt;402666&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The discrete localization of the A2A receptor within the striatum and its ability to functionally antagonize the actions of the D2 receptor has led to suggestion of the potential utility of A2A receptor antagonists for the symptomatic treatment of PD in a pivotal review [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="348952"&gt;348952&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Selective ligands exist for adenosine receptors, and a recent review of various reference ligands, including A2A receptor antagonists, has been published [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="401699"&gt;401699&lt;/ulink&gt;] and prospects for future drugs have been summarized [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="395861"&gt;395861&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Synthesis and SAR&lt;/subtitle&gt;Some of the early adenosine A2A receptor antagonists such as &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="8964"&gt;ZM-241385&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="16955"&gt;Zeneca Group plc&lt;/ulink&gt;; first published in 1991) and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="9188"&gt;Sch-58261&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="19711"&gt;Schering-Plough Corp&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1994) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="401699"&gt;401699&lt;/ulink&gt;] are structurally derived from &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="7814"&gt;CGS-15943&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="23137"&gt;Novartis AG&lt;/ulink&gt;; 1986) originally discovered at Ciba-Geigy in the US from in vitro evaluation of related benzodiazepine receptor ligands. The furan moiety and a triazolo-fused bicyclic ring structure are conserved in these three molecules. KW-6002 belongs to a different structural class, being derived from one of the world's most extensively consumed drugs, caffeine. KW-6002, an 8-substituted xanthine, is structurally related to the N,N-dipropyl analog, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="5529"&gt;KF-17837&lt;/ulink&gt; (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="17724"&gt;Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co Ltd&lt;/ulink&gt;) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="266522"&gt;266522&lt;/ulink&gt;] and chlorostyrylcaffeine (CSC) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="401689"&gt;401689&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The original publication of KW-6002 was a patent application, which appeared in 1993 (EP-00590919). The synthesis and SAR of a series of 8-styrylxanthines, including KW-6002 and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="5529"&gt;KF-17837&lt;/ulink&gt;, were reported [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="266522"&gt;266522&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The readily available 5,6-diamino-1,3-diethyl-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione was coupled with (E)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid, and the amide was ring-closed to the imidazo-fused pyrimidine in hot sodium hydroxide. The resultant xanthine derivative was methylated at the 7-position using methyl iodide in the presence of potassium carbonate to give KW-6002. This paper highlighted that diethyl substitution at the 1- and 3-position dramatically potentiated in vivo activity [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="266522"&gt;266522&lt;/ulink&gt;]. A description of the synthesis and SAR of the [11C]-radiolabeled drug has also been published [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="364744"&gt;364744&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/subtitle&gt;Studies of in vitro binding and haloperidol-induced catalepsy in mice have been carried out for KW-6002 and the corresponding N,N-dipropyl xanthine derivative, &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="5529"&gt;KF-17837&lt;/ulink&gt; [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="266522"&gt;266522&lt;/ulink&gt;]. KW-6002 was shown to have higher affinity for the A2A receptor in comparison to the A1 receptor (Ki values of 2.2 +/- 0.34 nM and 150 +/- 22 nM, respectively). &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="5529"&gt;KF-17837&lt;/ulink&gt; showed a similar profile to KW-6002 with Ki values of 1.0 +/- 0.057 nM and 62 +/- 11 nM for A2A and A1 receptors, respectively. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Despite having similar in vitro profiles, these two structurally similar xanthines appear to have dramatically different in vivo potencies, as measured by attenuation of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in mice, with KW-6002 being clearly more potent (ED50 values of 0.03 mg/kg and 2.7 mg/kg for KW-6002 and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="5529"&gt;KF-17837&lt;/ulink&gt;, respectively). This divergence in in vivo activity may be due to differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, metabolism and/or bioavailability. The in vitro binding figures are weaker when the apparatus is exposed to light, which may be explained by the compounds photolability at the exocyclic double bond, resulting in some isomerization from the pure (E)-isomer [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="210845"&gt;210845&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="266522"&gt;266522&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A number of animal models of PD have been employed to demonstrate the potential utility of KW-6002 in providing symptomatic relief. Direct injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle or striatum of rodents destroys dopaminergic nigrostriatal projections, resulting in a depletion of striatal dopamine levels. Following lesioning, dopamine receptors on the lesioned side become supersensitive to stimulation. Thus, unilaterally lesioned animals typically rotate in a direction contralateral to the side of the lesion when treated with dopamine agonists such as apomorphine or the dopamine precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). KW-6002 and &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="5529"&gt;KF-17837&lt;/ulink&gt; both prolonged the duration of turning induced by apomorphine and L-DOPA in rats unilaterally lesioned with 6-OHDA [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="395863"&gt;395863&lt;/ulink&gt;], suggesting that this class of compound has utility in PD as an adjunctive treatment to L-DOPA or dopamine agonists.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Systemic administration of 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in mice or primates can also be used to selectively destroy dopaminergic neurons within the substantial nigra, thereby causing a permanent depletion of striatal dopamine levels. In this context, it is noteworthy that accidental poisoning with MPTP results in permanent PD-like symptoms in man [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="402649"&gt;402649&lt;/ulink&gt;]. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In mice, pretreatment with MPTP results in a pronounced reduction of movement (hypolocomotion), which can be temporarily reversed by administration of KW-6002. In primates, MPTP reproduces a number of symptoms associated with PD, such as hypolocomotion, difficulty initiating movement and a general slowness of movement. Furthermore, as observed in PD patients, MPTP-treated primates also suffer dyskinesias following repeated administration of L-DOPA. A series of studies have been conducted to examine the utility of KW-6002 in providing symptomatic relief in this model. In MPTP-treated marmosets, orally administered KW-6002 reversed motor disability scores in a dose-dependent manner. However, KW-6002 only modestly increased overall locomotor activity (LMA) and did not cause abnormal movement, such as stereotypy. Promisingly, no tolerance was observed over 21 days at a dose of 10 mg/kg. At this dose, the drug induced little or no dyskinesia in MPTP-treated primates previously primed to exhibit dyskinesia by prior exposure to L-DOPA [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="364750"&gt;364750&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="364751"&gt;364751&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Importantly, these effects were observed without cotreatment with L-DOPA, suggesting that KW-6002 may provide symptomatic benefit when given as monotherapy without inducing dyskinesia.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An additional study in MPTP-treated marmosets examined the effects of KW-6002 when given in combination with L-DOPA, the selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="13717"&gt;SKF-80723&lt;/ulink&gt; (GlaxoSmithKline) or the D2 agonist quinpirole [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="374475"&gt;374475&lt;/ulink&gt;]. The ability of KW-6002 to enhance antiparkinsonian activity was more marked in combination with L-DOPA and quinpirole than with &lt;ulink linkType="Drug" linkID="13717"&gt;SKF-80723&lt;/ulink&gt;. Furthermore, KW-6002 did not potentate the dyskinesias elicited by L-DOPA in this study. The effects of KW-6002 in these studies appear to be mediated through blockade of A2A receptors. The A1 antagonist DPCPX was ineffective, while administration of the A2 selective agonist APEC suppressed basal LMA. Furthermore, a minimum effective dose of APEC (0.62 mg/kg ip) completely reversed the increase in motor activity produced by administration of KW-6002 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="374475"&gt;374475&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A separate study in MPTP-treated cynomolgus monkeys found that higher po doses of 60 and 90 mg/kg of KW-6002 were required to potentiate the effects of L-DOPA/benserazide [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="364739"&gt;364739&lt;/ulink&gt;] and again, KW-6002 did not potentiate L-DOPA induced dyskinesias. The necessity for higher doses in this study as compared to reports using marmosets may reflect species differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, metabolism and/or bioavailability of KW-6002. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In a recent mechanistic study, KW-6002 (3 mg/kg po) caused a marked and sustained decrease of extracellular GABA levels assessed by microdialysis in the globus pallidus of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, whereas no changes in GABA levels were observed in the corresponding regions of non-lesioned rats. Microinjection of the &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="23137"&gt;Novartis&lt;/ulink&gt; A2A receptor agonist CGS-21680 (0.005 to 0.5 microg) into the striatum of non-lesioned animals increased GABA concentrations in the globus pallidus. This reversal of the 6-OHDA-induced increase in pallidal GABA levels by KW-6002 suggests that the antiparkinsonian effects of A2A receptor antagonists occur on the striatopallidal neurons [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="395884"&gt;395884&lt;/ulink&gt;], confirming earlier postulates of GABA involvement [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="348952"&gt;348952&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;It has also recently been reported that A2A receptor antagonists possess neuroprotective properties [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="401692"&gt;401692&lt;/ulink&gt;]. For example, A2A antagonists have been shown to block kainate-induced excitotoxicity in the hippocampus [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="402654"&gt;402654&lt;/ulink&gt;], to reduce ischemia-evoked glutamate and aspartate release from the cortex, and to reduce the extent of the ischemia-induced injury in rats and gerbils [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="348953"&gt;348953&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="401692"&gt;401692&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Further evidence for A2A-receptor mediated neuroprotection arises from recent studies demonstrating that both cerebral infarct size and neurological deficits following transient ischemia are attenuated in A2A-receptor knockout mice [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="402661"&gt;402661&lt;/ulink&gt;]. These data are in line with the view that adenosine, through activation of A2A receptors, can act as an excitatory neuromodulator, and that blockade of these receptors confers neuroprotective effects, in part, by inhibiting glutamate release. These findings are significant because glutamate excitotoxicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD, and it has been speculated that a blockade or reduction in glutamatergic neurotransmission may arrest neurodegeneration in PD [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="402663"&gt;402663&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Thus, A2A receptor antagonists such as KW-6002 may have a dual role in treating this disease, effectively slowing further neurodegeneration while providing symptomatic relief with fewer side effects compared to existing therapies.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Metabolism&lt;/subtitle&gt;No data are currently available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Toxicity&lt;/subtitle&gt;No toxicity was reported in the animal studies outlined above, and no tolerance was observed in marmosets administered 10 mg/kg over 21 days [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="364750"&gt;364750&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="364751"&gt;364751&lt;/ulink&gt;]. Furthermore, KW-6002 did not cause stereotypy.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Clinical Development&lt;/subtitle&gt;An important principle, ie, symptomatic relief of Parkinsonian symptoms in man, was illustrated following the efficacy of the relatively weak and unselective adenosine antagonist theophylline in treating movement disorders in man [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="401690"&gt;401690&lt;/ulink&gt;], helping to establish the therapeutic potential of A2A receptor antagonists in PD. Although no peer-reviewed articles on human studies of KW-6002 had been published at the time of writing this evaluation, a number of reports have appeared (from mainly company sources), which tentatively suggest that KW-6002's clinical status is phase II trials.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase I&lt;/subtitle&gt;&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="26178"&gt;F Hoffmann-La Roche&lt;/ulink&gt; announced in 1997 that they had licensed KW-6002 from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo, and that the compound had good tolerability in the Japanese company's phase I trials in healthy volunteers [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="271321"&gt;271321&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, Roche announced that it was handing the drug back to the originating company in September 1998, citing concerns relating to findings in metabolism studies [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="402672"&gt;402672&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Phase II &lt;/subtitle&gt;Entry into a phase II PD trial in the US was announced late in 1999 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="342643"&gt;342643&lt;/ulink&gt;], reflecting a Kyowa Hakko Kogyo press release [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="360980"&gt;360980&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Side Effects and Contraindications&lt;/subtitle&gt;No specific data are currently available, but good tolerability was reported in phase I studies [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="271321"&gt;271321&lt;/ulink&gt;]. In MPTP-treated monkeys, treatment with KW-6002 was not reported to induce dyskinesia [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="364750"&gt;364750&lt;/ulink&gt;], [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="364751"&gt;364751&lt;/ulink&gt;].&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Patent Commentary&lt;/subtitle&gt;The European patent claiming KW-6002, EP-00590919, entitled 'Therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease' was published on 6 April 1994. EP-0590919 was granted on 29 December 1999 and takes its priority from a Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Japanese application of 28 September 1992. A synthesis process patent, US-05484920, entitled 'Preparation of xanthine derivatives for treatment of Parkinson's disease' was issued on 16 January 1996, and was followed by another process application, JP-09040652, issued on 10 February 1997. An earlier European patent (EP-00565377), entitled 'Pharmaceutical compositions containing xanthine derivatives for treatment of Parkinson's disease', was granted on 7 January 1998. Kyowa Hakko Kogyo patent applications exist which claim KW-6002 for the alternative indications of depression, neuronal degeneration and sleep disturbance, and Eisai have claimed the molecule for the treatment of diabetes, along with other A2A antagonists. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Xanthine-based adenosine receptor antagonists derived from caffeine and theophylline have been the subject of many diverse patent applications over the years. However, the main competing intellectual property within xanthines related to KW-6002 appears to be from Ken Jacobson and co-workers at the US Department of Health and Human Services (&lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="20518"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/ulink&gt;). WP-09425462, entitled 'Preparation of 8-styryl-1,3,7-trialkylxanthine derivatives as A2-selective adenosine receptor antagonists' published on 10 November 1994, which covers CSC, traces its priority to the issued US-05861405, filed on 3 May 1993. This patent, along with the J Med Chem article, submitted for publication in November 1992 [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="401688"&gt;401688&lt;/ulink&gt;], contains a number of dimethoxystyrylxanthine derivatives; the article does not specifically describe KW-6002, however.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Other biopharmaceutical companies that have filed compound patents within the field of adenosine A2A antagonists include Astra Zeneca (ICI Pharmaceuticals, UK), Schering-Plough (US/Italy) &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="16227"&gt;Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co Ltd&lt;/ulink&gt; and &lt;ulink linkType="Company" linkID="15872"&gt;Eisai Co Ltd&lt;/ulink&gt; (Japan) and most recently Vernalis (Cerebrus) Research Ltd (UK).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;subtitle&gt;Current Opinion&lt;/subtitle&gt;Given the paucity of effective new symptomatic treatments for PD, adenosine A2A receptor antagonists have exciting therapeutic potential in this area, with KW-6002 as the first clinically investigated compound. Some questions remain, for example regarding the chemical stability of KW-6002, and precisely why KW-6002 was returned to its originating company so rapidly after licensing to Hoffman La-Roche. In addition, some of the effective oral doses in primates are high (60 and 90 mg/kg oral doses) [&lt;ulink linkType="reference" linkID="364739"&gt;364739&lt;/ulink&gt;]. However, with exciting primate data generated in relevant models of PD, further clinical data for KW-6002 are eagerly awaited.&lt;/para&gt;</ExpertReview><IDdbDevelopmentStatus><DevelopmentStatusCurrent><Company id="1042596">Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co Ltd</Company><Country id="JP">Japan</Country><DevelopmentStatus id="L"
